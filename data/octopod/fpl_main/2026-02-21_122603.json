      "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome back to FPL Fran. Today's video is going to be the gameweek 27 cheat sheet after that abomination of a gameweek 26 at least for myself, right? Congratulations to people who triple captain rice. We actually talked about that possibly in this video, but just from a risk perspective does make sense to sort of bet against the field at times or just a general rice captaincy, right? I can understand probably the triple captain could have swung it back to Gabrielle, especially as you get that exclusive sort of additional ownership of the defense. Has it categorically failed? Yeah, I would say so. Seven points is not the worst in terms of triple captaincy. I think I've seen worse. Um, admittedly, I don't think I I've had worse myself, so excuse myself if I'm not the happiest recording this video, but we're looking ahead towards gaming 27. There's a couple gameweeks left until blank gameweek 31. still think there's a lot of scope for different picks to to do well from a team macro perspective. Liverpool, Aston Villa, United, Brenford of course I think at the top of people's lists are interesting and amongst that of course we have a lot of cheat sheet changes. So if you've never seen the effectively a tier list of players across all positions in FPL looking at the sort of price point and the valuation of the player across you know the whole scope of the game. So midfields, forwards, defenders, all kind of rated in terms of what I think gen generically good team structures are. So a lot of the data that you can see as well within this video will also be supported by the opts tool. It's a tool which you can find within the link in description below. Gives you all the tools and I would say data that that you need to sort of succeed alongside of course the expected points model from Vanity Football Hub if you're interested in that and even getting suggested transfers. Right. So let's jump into the cheat sheet. To me, I think Lefay deserves to drop. Part of this, I think, is Sutherland's fixture run is going to get worse. Another element, I suppose, is I still think the Defcon numbers aren't good enough. And then, of course, Diara's just taking the last penalty. I don't think there's many guarantees that Lefay will take the next one, even though you can say that that's in doubt. So, to me, he gets that drop. Adley has been added towards the cheat sheet. He's an extremely cheap pick. I mean, Ryan as well, but Ryan's in the next tier. But effectively in this sort of 5.0, consider 5.5 tier. I think you've got some absolutely great defcon monsters and then you've got players like Adley who have very interesting underlying stats, you know, more from a kind of open play perspective. When you compare, for example, to the likes of Buendia, I mean, Buendia, if you knew he had perfect minutes, would be a really good pick. And I think right now Adley's at least in a state right now where his minutes have actually improved. At the start of the season, he was not really getting the minutes. And I don't think it's something to do with Semeno necessarily, but also just, you know, he himself has kind of run into a good set of form here. And so Rayan himself has kind of stepped into that role on the right hand side and and I think he could probably lock that down. So a huge benefit now to have two Bournemouth midfielders at very good price points who have really good underlying stats. Now with Ryan, I think the sample size is extremely small. But if you actually go back to his numbers within Ser in the Brazil, I think his numbers were actually really good. they were more xg tilted. So, so far, of course, him actually having a little bit of x AG showing a little bit of creativity within the recent matches is a positive, but I think let's not overreact to some of the numbers so far. But I think maybe you can just say you can trust, let's say, a team like Bournemouth and and how they've been able to kind of develop players. Um, I think just the simple fact that Ero is more confident in giving someone like Ryan more minutes than Krooppy says a lot just in terms of how Ryan's minutes could pan out over the next few weeks. And yeah, I mean, even touching 90 minutes is is extremely impressive. So definitely a bit jealous as a Crippy Junior owner over some of the other sort of warmer potential picks in the midfield now and I think they're all quite interesting. Anderson and Garner still top just because of, you know, how excellent they are in defcon. And Casemiro, I feel like a positive that now we're seeing just more consistent minutes and he himself will just get the space to get minutes in in almost every single match because the rest is a little bit more measured for a player like Casemiro with a, you know, sort of element of United not being involved in a lot of cup competitions. As far as Somerville, I think this is a drop that is really just going against the backdrop of West Ham's fixtures, you know, turning a little bit worse now. So, this to me is probably the last good West Ham game and then you have a mixture of pretty poor away games and then some tougher home games, but you know, occasionally a decent home game here and there. And I think that's probably not good enough to justify Summerville being a green pick. He clearly is probably a player who's still absolutely, you know, at the top of his game, just scored in the FA Cup as well, coming off the bench and the minutes is still perfect. So, you know, is there much to really be said that Somerville, you know, will get knocked off massively? No. I think this is kind of like if you were owning Harry Wilson over a pretty poor run of games and of course, I think the additional pieces, he's not on as many set pieces, right? So, Harry Wilson, on the other hand, I think is about to reenter basically a pretty good run of fixtures himself. So that's kind of why in the next tier we've also given him a rise with so I think this is very much the same situation as well. He doesn't have the underlying stats really to kind of suggest that he's a top pick, but he is more of an all-rounder. Not too far off from, let's say, an NI. Again, doesn't have the penalties, but then I think the set piece sort of threat from Zo, the bonus element as well is very massive in terms of making him a very good well-rounded pick in FPL and still the open play threat is there. We saw the goal versus Brighton. So, he is capable of doing that. And then I I suppose you can always apply, I guess, the the the positive finisher inflation if you really want to do so. I mean, he he does seem to be generally one of, you know, the best free kick takers we have right now in the Premier League. So, yeah, a huge positive there that that kind of can gloss over the the slightly poor NPXG per 90 from Sabo. As far as Ahmad and Enzo, I think they both drop. I don't I feel a bit harsh on Ahmad because I I still think the numbers for him have looked pretty good. They have tapered off a little bit, I think, with the sort of new role. I still like United's attack. I I don't think the, you know, the the West Ham game was the best showing of it so far. And of course, it kind of goes in line with some of the pe some of the people's potential concerns for this United team versus, you know, what we call a quote unquote low block. I I still think for the most part that there will be games, yes, of course, where United can be shut out, but for the most part, their attack, you know, has a lot of quality. Um, and I don't think much has fundamentally changed my opinion on that. And I still think that he's a player who's more impervious to minute shifts even if, let's say, a couple role changes happen within the team in terms of setup. Right? So for example, let's say if CES goes to play more games going forwards versus certain types of oppositions, I still think Kuna is the first one to lose out minutes. Ahmad's role in terms of sort of holding position on the right and then also his sort of defensive presence as well more from a sort of pressing perspective and then just in general his ability to kind of support I think the the fullback in Dalo at times when Dalo for example goes a little bit towards the interior is quite evident whereas you know with someone like Kuna when you actually watch him play the interreation with him and Embuma I would think is actually Kuna goes a little bit more inside at times out of possession and Embuma actually tends to take on that sort of leftwing type role whereas Of course, if Cesco is going to come in, I still think Qua just drops out of the picture entirely, whereas Ahmad has pretty much made that position his on the right hand side. So, all that to say, yes, maybe there's a bit of a diminishing of the sort of impact, I guess, from Ahmad. Another thing to mention is that he's recently given back some of the set pieces on that right hand side in the corner taking back to Bemo. So, I I think that's a bit of a negative impact on Ahmad as well. Something that I just wanted to take into account. As far as Enzo, part of the reason why he's dropping is just that, you know, this is the last amazing Chelsea fixture. So, of course, I'm not advocating anyone to sell Enzo after this week, but I think it is almost sort of making way for the idea that you just should be prepared to let go of someone like Enzo ahead of what is a pretty tough fixture run. Now, FPL is a game where, of course, Enzo, I think, with the underlying stats that he's had this season, you'll never feel too bad owning someone like that. And of course, he can still do well in spite of the tougher fixtures. But I I think because there's so much variety right now within the game and there's so much value in terms of I guess jumping often jumping jumping off terrible fixtures into good fixture runs for very interestingly priced players from from Brenford like a Dango or even some of the Bournemouth players. I I I do think there's enough scope to say Enzo's worth the sell. As far as the the other tiers, I've actually dropped Rice. Now, this comes off of Rice actually holding within the double game week, but I do think that the double game week has to, you know, come come into account here where the Defcon numbers were exceptional within the double game week. He hit Defcon twice, I think, quite easily and comfortably as well. You could argue that that's maybe slightly oppo opponent dependent, too. But yeah, I I I still think that as a sort of standalone midfield pick, I don't think Rice is necessarily still sort of at the level of some of the other players in open play, like even a Bruno G this season, who I think has sort of taken his game towards a new level. Unfortunately, of course, with a hamstring injury as well, that seems to be quite significant. But coming out of the double with single game weeks left to go, I think Rice actually is someone that you could still consider transferring out of your team. He's not really in the Enzo camp of having terrible fixtures. And I think he's a bit more impervious to terrible fixtures because as a bit of a deaf connor or a consistent defconer. The beauty I suppose of holding someone in that position like Rice in FPL is you don't really have to think too hard about whether that player is worth transferring in. I think there there is scope to sort of improve like maybe pushing towards Semeno but that once again is if you have that sort of free transfer cushion. Same with Rogers as well. So, I don't feel too bad about anyone who wants to hold Rice up until the blank game 31. But with that in mind, that's kind of why also the backdrop is Arsenal players are starting to drop on the cheat sheet where it makes sense for me to to drop them. I've added Gordon back into the cheat sheet. He's back now. Scored four goals versus Carback. Does that really matter? Does that really change our influence our decisions? Not really. But I think it helps of course that Bruno G's out. That kind of guarantees a bit more pen share across the games. And I think his own personal form I suppose which includes the Champions League probably just means more minutes within the Premier League too. He's just going to be a differential for me. Nothing else to say there with Kuna. I think there are genuine fears about you know his minutes and whether Cesco is able to sort of claim more going forwards. And for that reason I think I'm going to drop him. I think as you can see anyways with all the car sort of lineups the early substitutions he does seem to be that sort of player who is more obviously the odd one out compared to let's say Embu or compared to let's say Ahmad. So I do think going forwards he's someone whose minutes will probably a bit more fragile and we've already started to see that you know baked in. Salah to me gets a rise. This is just simply due to the fixture landscape for Liverpool. He's played a touch better recently. I don't think you know that he's made leaps and strides. I don't think Ramadan is someone that I'm I'm even going to take into account in terms of trying to sort of make a conjecture over a single sort of solitary player and and whether their performance will be impacted over this run. I just think simply the minutes look like they're absolutely there for Salah. And you can even look at a player like Palmer is a good example for this in FPL. But a player doesn't necessarily need to be playing the best in open play if they play for a team that in theory should have other routes towards points. Right? We're seeing Salah takes at pieces. So he takes those right hand side corners. You're starting to see Salah as well on free kicks. There's value there. You're starting to also see well Salah play 90 minutes which means that as a penalty maker he should stand to benefit just kind of like when so took a penalty and completely missed it. I mean that that's scope for points right? So I think Salah just makes a lot of sense. All these things in general should also be inflated when you play versus worse opponents and worse defenses. So I still think, you know, as much as we can criticize Salon Open play this season, as much as we can criticize some of the numbers, you know, in in relation to the price point, I still think there's a lot of scope to say Salah makes a lot of sense going forward as a transfer. So he gets a rise uh in the forward position. Moving over to that now, Strand Larson was added last week. I don't think I've I've really changed my opinion in terms of him. I still think that if you actually look back and revisit the chances of Spurnley, it's not like they were clear-cut amazing chances. I don't think he's necessarily on penalties over Sar. So I I think the jury is still out there. Great finishes versus Burnley though. But yeah, I mean the the fixtures do turn quite quickly after Wolves at home. So it's very hard to justify making him green. Manet is going to have a blanking 31 soon. So he definitely deserves a drop, but I'm not going to drop him this week. I mean these types of picks in terms of the group of juniors and the man's at the bare minimum they're still providing a lot more value than some of the other players within other positions especially within the midfield for example like for like at the 4.5 4.3 type tier. Um so there's still value there and part of it as well is owning a Kroo Junior Armani I think is still probably within the best types of structures that you can find with an FPL. I know recently people have moved into more of the 343 type structure especially for those who are consolidating let's say on the position of holding Holland in their teams um and and maybe not considering that switch towards Salah especially as let's say the likes of Saka and Palmer until recently of course have not been interesting for people in FPL same with Salah so I can understand why people are adopting a structure that still has even maybe the double of Krooppy Junior Money as far as let's say rest of the Chi-Chi movements Raul is still yellow and I haven't touched him. But I do think that it's worth mentioning that Mooney is around the corner. So for anyone who's actually interested in sort of investing into this Fulham run, something to think about there where I think maybe you'd probably like to skirt around Raul even though he could look interesting from a fixture point of view. With Carver, I think he's still probably my favorite pick altogether. If you kind of compare the players in that 5.5 to 6.5 million tier, but in reality, a lot of the bread is buttered in that 7 million tier and above. Thiago is about to enter into the the most luxurious fixture run. J Pedro's numbers have actually been excellent this season. His minutes under Rs have looked really good. The underlying stats under Rena have looked really good. So I I think he's benefited the most probably out of all the forwards in recent times with, you know, a managerial change. It is hard to justify sort of continuously making moves towards players like Jao Pedro, especially when the fixtures do turn. So I still think that I'd caution probably not having to make such aggressive transfers towards Ja Pedro. It it almost does feel like the boat has been missed in terms of if you want to make a Chelsea transfer unless once again you've got let's say scope to have three to four free transfers in the bank. You can go for J Pedro maybe consider captaining him versus Bernie at home. But that's how I feel about Ja Pedro. Uh with Thiago though this is the fix as I said. So to me I think he's close to essential over the next two to three weeks as a buy and this is a pick that will serve most people well you know going forwards or at least up until black gaming 31. As far as Ekitique, I've given him a very very soft drop. I I do think it's a bit harsh. Liverpool are about to enter into really good fixture run, but I still think that his minutes are not, you know, tip-top compared to some of the other Liverpool attackers or options that you can choose from. And then, of course, there's a price point piece there, too, and the lack of penalties compared to some of the other forwards within the game. The underlying stats have been really healthy, but of course, do note that some of the other players here on this list are more close to 90minute players than than echit. I think so far you've seen of course slot seems to want to play as much as humanly possible which includes for example resting him in FA Cup games where possible but there will be an impact anyways when Liverpool have fixtures around their first set of Champions League playoff games. So that's going to have a little bit of a latter impact on EkitK and I think there are murmurss potentially that Isach, you know, could be coming back soon. That that could still be completely far off base, but yeah, just something to think about in terms of Ekit. As far as the Holland piece of of news, I've chosen not to react to to Holland news. We've seen him in training. I don't think I'm really going to make any movements around Holland. I I I think that in FPL we we tend to sort of play a game where of course we we we do think about the downsides of of not owning someone who's extremely highly owned without sort of paying respect to the opportunity that you can actually go and skirt around that at times. And I and I do think coming out of the Newcastle at home fixture, there is a pretty good opportunity for people to kind of move away from Holland and maybe reorganize their team structure just so something that I'm just going to lay out there. I'm certainly consider it myself. I don't think I necessarily even need a Holland injury for me to force moves around Holland. Um, but even just a natural transfer after the Newcastle home game, which looks very appetizing right now, is on the cards for myself. But I can I can also see why people would not want to do that. And and part of that is also we're very likely to wild card back into Holland if you have the wild card left and you're planning to wild card on 32, right? So once the blanking 31 passes, if you've deadended without Holland on your team, you're very likely to revisit an FPL template when you wild card with Holland back. And so you might stand to lose several million in FPL and and maybe that's not not something that you really want to deal with. But as the season closes in, I think there is scope to to say if Holland's minutes are a touch worse and he does blank in 31 that you have an opportunity to consider more riskier options to to the people who want to do that. Uh for defense, I actually haven't made too many changes. Admittedly, I think a lot of changes could happen the week after this one because I think in defense, whilst I still have Richards and Maguire here, very clearly there's going to be a brutal swing here for a lot of the Crystal Palace players. I know I've let's say moved down someone like Enzo uh within the midfield position. But I think with defenders, especially with those who actually have defcon potential, you're a bit more insulated at times from what we call swings. there's still a good leads at home fixture in the distance for some of the Crystal Palace defenders. So, I feel that it would be a bit too harsh sort of to to downgrade them this week ahead of Wolves at home, which is still a great game despite what the Wolves the latest result the Wolves have had versus Arsenal would probably lead you to believe or at least the latest Crystal Palace result versus Burnley would have you believe. But Hill to me is is is probably the top defender in this bracket by a country mile. I think his defcon numbers are absolutely exceptional. I don't think you need to overread or underread into this too much. Sure, the sample size is small, but I think in his short time sort of playing very consistent minutes now. I think he's almost outperformed Sessi in Defcon in a lot of key stats, you know, for example, things like aerial duels, not just for example, the amount of clearances he puts and and gets Defcon from. You can see Hill doing great work. Now, I think the offensive element of the game is probably a little bit overblown when you kind of look at the underlying data. I mean, some of the assists recently have been a bit fluky, but the Davcoon numbers are there, and I think he's so far clear of some of the the the other options now and still has a very good fixture run for the most part where I think he'll just it makes a lot of sense as a pick. Magguire does actually look very interesting and I've talked within previous episodes about how I have liked the United defense and, you know, it does line up with the overall picture of the season with the XGC that United have as a team. So, they've been a pretty impressive defense. I do think there's a small asterisk with Magguire here where as an owner myself, I think that the concern is, you know, did he suffer an hamstring injury versus West Ham or did he not? Um, is Yoro's performance good enough to sort of even, you know, unseat Meguire? We don't know. I mean, until Delect is back, I still think it it makes sense for me to to not sort of overread that with Meguire, and I think he's still a good pick, but that does remain to be seen. I think I would personally just go with the Dalo right now if I wanted to invest into that United defense. I think Everton away, you know, despite it being an away match, it's still actually a really good fixture on paper just because United are very solid defense and I don't think Everton are particularly good offense themselves, especially with sort of the key injuries, right? That being the backdrop of Everton's, you know, recent sort of underlying performances. Alder did sort of suffer a potential injury. I'm not sure if he's, you know, fully fit. I think he should be totally fine. When I was looking at the Sunderland FA Cup game, unfortunately, it wasn't, you know, great information because, of course, I think they had the opportunity to kind of rest most of their squad and, you know, for example, Mukle actually played center back within that match. But going forwards, maybe he'll he'll be fine. I I think that the key thing overall with Sunderland is that at this sort of price point, I really don't think I can be too harsh on on any of the players here, especially when some of these players actually have really good defcon numbers to back it up and aren't, for example, I guess, the quality defense that, let's say, a Burnley are. So, not too many comments to make around this sort of price bucket. You have a lot of options in the 4.5 plus tier. The only change that I've made is that Vanderberg has gotten a rise. I I think Coyote might actually still be the best option if you want to just be invested in the Brenford defense, but I still think things like Defcon do matter within the game. And I think Vandenberg is still a very solid pick from that perspective, right? He's not really a deaf corner at the level of let's say a SNSi for example or or even some of the other options that we've mentioned like an Anderson in the past but with a really good fixture run with much higher expected clean sheets over this pair than some of the other picks potentially he's a player who's already usurped Collins I I think it's tricky for me to to delve into a territory where I'm that certain because I think we've seen Keith Andrew rotate center back pairings like he doesn't care. A lot of managers tend to like to keep central back pairings or you see for example one player come in, one player come out. Instead I think what we've suddenly moved from was when Vandenberg first got his injury we saw Ayier come into the team playing alongside Collins. Then suddenly he was totally comfortable also just playing Vandenberg alongside a year when Collins was rumored to have a knock in training and since then Collins has not really played too much football and Brenford have actually also gotten some massive results in that period whilst Vandenberg and a have kept their plays. Now maybe a year is actually a better option cuz I think his defcon numbers could be a bit marginally better. Um I am almost taking a call here that I think Vandenberg minutes could be the safest out of the three. I could be wrong and I I'm happy to be proven wrong, but I've also been speaking to Brenford fans as of late and I can tell you they're also wrong. So, make of that the best that you will. Um, O'Reilly, I've reacted to the cheat sheet. I I just think that the minute security within the midfield position that he currently plays right now despite also playing very well and sort of assuming left back duties in recent times has been a huge positive for O'Reilly because you can see of course you know he can now score goals in open play again and get some really good underlying stats. I I think the key piece here is that as as players have dropped out of the pecking order, players like Fodden and players have sort of continually locked down their spots like Bernardo Silva, you know, O'Reilly has really emerged within the midfield position that he sort of plays and he he is still someone who I think that Pep relies upon to provide what this team misses a lot, especially in terms of the sort of out of possession piece for Man City in the midfield. So, O'Reilly has been excellent. I think he deserves to be readded to the cheat sheet. But of course, you know, the the backdrop is blank gaming 31. Akenate gets a rise. This is Liverpool about to jump into basically the best fixture run that any sort of defense will have over the next five games, gaming 31 included. Um, and that's the key thing here with Liverpool where almost there's a changing of the guard with, let's say, some of the Arsenal picks and, you know, scope to move into some of the Liverpool picks. What I would say though is that on a pure sort of expected clean sheet basis up until gaming 31, there's really no reason to make that sort of siderade move of I don't know maybe let's say a Timber to a Van Djk or a Timber to Kate. But I can totally see why someone would want to make the move uh because Timber has been such a frustrating. So you know something to mention to is in recent games Timber's underlying stats have not been impressive whatsoever. I think over the course of the double game week he actually had some pretty poor XGI. This isn't really how you should look at sample data, but amongst the backdrop of many timber seasons, we've seen, you know, worse seasons in terms of underlying stats. People a couple weeks ago were touting how excellent Timber was as an option in attacking sort of opportunities and and how he's been able to accumulate XG, but then that's also suddenly clawed back after a few poor games where he's just not really done much, right? despite, you know, positionally, you know, you can watch him play for Arsenal, see him sort of occupying positions like, let's say, amongst center backs from the opposing team and just kind of infer that he's going to be in good opportunities all the time. The reality is I I I think Timber's sort of career baselines are probably more true an example of what Timber is, especially since he's already played a couple seasons with Arsenal and not much has radically changed within his role as a right back. So I I think Timber is still exceptional when you compare him against the peers of the field and he has still underperformed against that basis. But is he for example at the level of someone like Amunos from an attacking point of view? I don't think so personally. And a couple weeks ago you probably could have actually said yes if you're just looking at underlying stats. But it just shows you how things change so quickly in FPL which is why I think it it is important to kind of look at maybe even going back to career numbers and to not overreact to just one season's worth of numbers. Virgil of course has gotten the goals recently. The reality in FBL I think is any sort of defender is capable of getting a 17-point hole, right? I mean you've seen teams get Jamie Keen sheets. I don't think Virgil got a jammy kin sheet versus Sunderland. That's not the point that I'm trying to make. Liverpool's underlying stats actually from a defense point of view have been super impressive um from December. But I I think the point to make is that it's not like Virgil has suddenly emerged as one of the best set piece threats in the game. He always technically has been. But we've seen, you know, 17 points from Rodon from Amuki Alle. This is all capable when you have the fixtures align or or at least one gameweek aligning, you know, and I I think that ultimately when you have five fixtures in a row that are really good, you're going to have more scope to do things like that or at least to just consistently get points, right? Six to seven pointers. Like for example, a lot of the Arsenal defenders have done over spurts in the season. So this is a great spurt for Virgil. That's why he rises. We're not overreacting to the hole. This is just more reaction to the fixture run ahead. Chaloba drops. similar sort of reason to towards Enzo Hall drops. I do have to say if you want to call me out actually on the cheat sheet last week I I did drop to I didn't drop Hall probably a terrible call since then I think to has also scored another goal within the Champions League and Hall as I said was benched within the previous match within the Premier League. So it shows you how much I've overread into I guess Hall's ability to stay fit. I did think honestly with the sort of lack of options that they have that I' I'd probably think Burn would probably play more center back going forwards but I mean if their scope to sort of bench Hall and of course Newcastle are fighting on multiple fronts and maybe Champions League at this moment in time is I guess maybe arguably more important then that's not great for Hall if they continue to sort of you know advance and they will. So to me Hull gets a drop. I've given Celiba a drop. I've kept Timber as a top option because I still think when you compare Timber to Celiba, there's not much separating them from a expected clean sheets perspective, but after that it's basically just, you know, who has the most goal threat. Timber to me, despite sort of the criticisms that that I've raised in terms of his numbers, is still far clear, who is, I would say, a bit more gunshy compared to any of the options of the game, especially some of the center backs here within this list where you can actually look at their combined NPXGI. Yeah, he's not he's not anywhere close to it. In fact, he's probably one of the worst options just flat out. So, that's kind of it in terms of sort of my takes on defenders. And I think part of it too is almost saying if you want to sort of keep some of the Arsenal defenders, like that's the priority that I would keep them at. Khif Fury has also been taken away from the list. Unfortunately, it seems like he's still suffering from a lot of knocks and just injury prone overall. So, probably teaches me not to overreact to Kyle Fury despite how sort of enticing he might be at times. And to close off the cheat sheet with the goalkeepers given S drop obviously coming out of the double Henderson, you know, we've kept him at where he's at. Rya, Pigford, Don Roma all get drops because I just think that with the blank game for Ry and Don Roma, that's just going to hurt them. With Pigford, of course, I just think that the fix run for Everton is not particularly good even though you've got Burnley at home in the distance. Um, but yeah, the the underlying stats still have not been that pretty or impressive for Everton. So, that's going to be the cheat sheet. Thank you guys so so much for watching. I'll see you guys soon. Take care. Goodbye."

      "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome back to FPL Fran. Today's video is going to be my gameweek 27 team selection. We're still in the middle of gameweek 26. It's been a pretty uneventful gameweek for my team, my FPL squad. Part of that, of course, is this gameweek has been one where I think a lot of popular picks have have returned. We might not necessarily own those popular picks. I within my own team at least have the fortune of having Cole Palmer doing something. Otherwise, it's been a pretty uneventful gimmick because as I said, at the same time, I I feel like there have been some pretty interesting developments in terms of, you know, how I view players, the minutes of certain players. So, definitely lots of cheat sheet updates that we can share. So, do look forward to towards that video. And at the same time, I think transfer plans are sort of in flux for me, right? Some of it is sort of dependent on this overall, you know, maybe question mark on on Holland and whether he's fit generally for this run and and even if let's say a lesser fit Holland, you know, what what does that mean? I guess going ahead when when you know we've got a couple European fixtures to go before blank giving 31 and I guess the looming question of whether you maybe go for a Salah and and go against the grain a little bit as well with the sort of risk preference piece which I talked about in my transfer plans video for my team. As I said this week, a little bit uneventful. We're currently on a very very meager 40 points. I think the gameweek ranks literally 9.1 million. So clearly not doing very well. Part of that is as I said popular picks like Semeno, Jao Pedro doing exceptionally well. And then of course, you know, sort of my niche picks within Meguire, Richards here, for example, is just completely flopping. I'll have to monitor a couple injuries, but I think going forwards the the key thing in terms of my fixture planning, my team planning is most of my defenders are good to go in the sense that I can play Gabrielle Timber plus Anderson week to week and at least for the Chelsea players that are still within my team, you know, we still have one good game to go and then it's probably a due to to some of these players, but it is the best game in the entire league by a country mile. So, looking for something here, looking forward to to a lot. and of course a differential captaincy within my own team selection. But with the with the wider backdrop of Gaming 27, I think there's not too much news. You know, we had some FA Cup fixtures. We have the Knicks round of fixtures as well and and the draw coming out. That still pretty much leaves the open idea of I think a pretty big gameweek 33 coming into the picture. And that's a positive thing for FPL, I think, in terms of people who like doubles and blanks. Some people like to suggest that this creates a lot of gray arrows, but I do tend to think that unfortunately like the the latter stages of the season always tend to create that sort of murky picture in terms of if you follow let's say the conventional chip strategy, you will sort of be living within the realms of other people's picks. Things like, for example, your team value will kind of separate yourself. Things like whether you actually go for a different chip strategy, in my opinion, will give you more variety in terms of how you play. Now, the outcomes could be pretty disgusting or amazing. And we'll talk about chip strategy as we close in on blank gaming 31, but I think some people might have wild carded on 24 already and we did a wild card 24 video, but for anyone who's sort of holding on to the wild card, I think there's there's still really no reason to play it up until gaming 31 or gaming 32. So, we can kind of hold off on ship strategy, but there are some looming ideas and we can just continue to monitor teams. But generally I think the big fixture and big picture runs are a Villa, a Brford, a Liverpool as well alongside a generally good and clean fixture slate for United up until gamewing week 31. So that's the backdrop. If we look at specifically gameweek 27, um this is a huge gameweek for FPL in the sense that I think you can already jump as I said on onto some of the the big picture teams. At the same time, for someone like myself, I'm a I've gone a little bit too gung-ho with transfers. I feel like it probably makes the most sense to roll with in my case because once again this is a really good Chelsea fixture before the run turns sour. So, it doesn't really make sense for me to even, let's say, consider making moves this week up until maybe next week instead where I can start to move bigger pieces around. And this sort of yo-yo within my own squad where I've got Palmer and Holland, you know, we can sort of reconsider that when, let's say, Liverpool have much more overwhelmingly better fixtures than a City or or a Chelsea here, for example, in terms of expected goals. As we look at the 11 to five sort of predicted numbers, they're much better still for Chelsea and and City. So, I think no need necessarily on this specific week to to move off of a lot of the Liverpool picks, but there's definitely a a lot of fun possibilities, right, as as we kind of look ahead. It's just that generally speaking, you know, we are basically entering that stage of the season where if you're going to dead end gaming 32, I think some of the picks are a little bit more clearer than most. And then of course you know that if you're buying let's say a city player this week which some people have brought the idea of right players are buying Semeno and his prices I think already gone gone up once people are looking to maybe reinvest into some other city assets. I think Semeno is really the only one that I would do do so with Crystal Palace. I'd probably skip now that you're one Burnley at home fixture away from that blank gaming 31. So from that perspective, you know, that's kind of the I think the only the free risk basket, if that makes sense, where if you have a lot of luxury transfers, a pick like Seammana makes a lot of sense. Otherwise, you're kind of shopping from the rest of the bunch and that closes the kind of pool of players that we have available to us. For this week specifically, I think from a fixture point of view, I'd probably mention that once again, Villa looks interesting. Bournemouth is actually a very good team to invest into. Again, you know, we've recommended players like Evan Nilson and Krooppy. I do think Kroo's minutes have not really improved whatsoever and the midweek resting was something that I thought was plausible, but I didn't really think, you know, was that likely given that he's generally been playing quite well. At the same time, I put him on the bench for that specific reason. But in hisstead, players like Ryan and players like Amian Adley have already kind of clocked much better minutes than Krooppy Jr. ever has this season in terms of consecutive Premier League minute outings. So Rayan's definitely on the table here. Adley's on the table from a Bournemouth perspective. This is a pretty good fixture for them, no doubt. With West Ham, I I almost think that their run is closing off. This is to me the last good West Ham fixture before I think you probably sort of move away from some of your West Ham picks. So players like Somerville and Bowen who have featured heavily on the cheat sheet, this is almost your last outing with the with the West Ham. So at the same time, I think even, you know, with with picks like like maybe some of the Sunderland picks, this is once again one more good home game before you kind of head towards Gaming 31 where the fixtures are a little bit poor and and a bit more soured. Uh with with leads, for example, this is actually still a generally decent fixture run. They actually have out of all the teams that are sort of in that relegation battle, and I don't think leads necessarily are in it, but you know, they're close to it. They are actually about to head into a pretty good fixture on themselves as is a team like Fulham from this game week after. But even this game week is is much better than for example playing versus City away like they did last week. So that's kind of the overall picture and then as I said Brenford's a bit more obvious. We know players like Dango, Thiago and Shotti are on the picture. I think one thing to think about with Brenford is with Lewis Potter generally playing quite well and and you know even Damsguard for example before sort of the the more recent injury reinserting himself back into the team. Is it possible that players like Shotti and Dango will play less minutes? I think it's plausible. And so it it still falls back to that general picture of Thiago I think is still the baseline pick and unfortunately or maybe fortunately actually in recent weeks his his his price has dropped which means that I think it's worth reinvesting into him. So whilst J Pedro has gone up in price and and to be fair to Ja Pedro he's done amazing. To be fair to Seno he's done amazing as well but Thiago's ownership is now dropping but he still looks like definitely one of the top picks. even versus Arsenal, he probably had one of the most I I guess like one of the best opportunities to actually score a goal where where he didn't actually score a goal. Um if you think back even towards Arsenal's chances I mean MuK scoring was actually I wouldn't say a fluke because it was actually a great finish but the quality of Arsenal chances were poor. Whereas actually when you look at a team like Brenford the fact that Thiago probably had the best chance of the game that wasn't scored says a lot about how good this Brenford team are versus one of the best defenses that we've seen honestly within the last decade. So that's kind of the overall perspective that that I would have here at this point in time looking at this game week and that's kind of the the valuation picture. I think gone is the time to go for Crystal Palace assets. Look at Villa, look at Brenford, look at Liverpool as well. But even welcome the idea of a Bournemouth. Now let's shift gears towards my team selection for gaming 27. So I I think the big proviso here is that I think Erling Holland's fine. There has not really been news that Erling Holland has suffered anything but I guess a knock versus Fulham. But at the same time, I think the if you kind of look back at at I guess relitigating Pep and and and how he describes injuries, he's not the best at it. There have been periods where Holland, I think almost every season going back now, has missed several games in a row. This could be that iteration of it within the season in 25 26, but I'm hoping that it's not at the same time. Totally open to to the idea that Holland's out. So, we'll talk about if Holland's out, what I will do later on in the video. That will sort of be my I guess, you know, my option B. My option A this week is is keeping things simple in FPL. So I do plan on rolling the free transfer. I just don't really see the need to do so, especially when probably the best free transfer that I can actually make is something like ETK to Thiago. But that is so predicated on me having you know full faith and and certainty that Holland's fine. And I I think with let's say the possibility of Pep being a bit more koi and us not actually having perfect information on Holland, it's very plausible that a rule-free transfer will put me in a better position come 28 to actually kind of you know make that sort of decision on do I sort of move Holland out of my team, do I not? Do we have information etc? Should I act upon it? So option A for me is going to be me rolling. I simply plan on playing triple Arsenal defense again versus Tottenham away. Now, ironically, Tottenham have have been a pretty good away team. They have a new manager now, though. And and I I still think for the most part that Arsenal have, you know, plenty of great chances to keep them out. Wolves at home is there for Richard, so he's going to come into the team. This is 352 coming back into me for for FPL. You know, is there an opportunity for me to play players like Meguire, players like maybe Anderson? Absolutely. But I I think Anderson is definitely someone that I'll talk about in a moment. But I I still like the idea of probably playing Lefay over in Anderson. It's to me a 50/50 because I think both players have shown recently I think that their defcon numbers are are are decent. The main thing here is that am I backing a team like Sunderland at home who have you know an exceptional home record. Not exactly the best attack once again. So you know I I don't see for example Anderson having some sort of massive floor here. I mean with the defcon potential with the clean sheet being quite high because of course Sunderland's baseline sort of underlying stats for attack aren't so good. Anderson's always going to be a good pick but at the same time Lefay still interests me despite seemingly losing penalties back to Diarro this weekend. I don't think it was that significant that he actually didn't take the penalty. I mentioned this in my transfer plan video but I I still think there's an opportunity for Lefay to take future penalties. He actually mentioned that him and Diara were going to share penalties and he already previously mentioned that Diar is going to take the Knicks penalty for Sunderland. So maybe there is a a possibility in the future where Diara, you know, allows him to take the Knicks penalty. I won't keep my hopes up, but that's kind of the bet here with one of the last sort of possible Lefay games for me to play. As I said, with Sunderland still having a pretty good home game. Uh Bruno's an obvious play in the midfield. Enzo and Palmer are definitely going to be played as well. Sabo gets to be welcomed back into the team. As I mentioned last week, I think holding Saba makes a lot of sense. He's on an exceptional run of form. He is kind of I mean, he's like the the opposite to the the sort of open play value threat. Now, he did score an amazing goal versus Brighton within the FA Cup and that was actually threaded in through Wasalah and just basically a rocketed shot towards the top left corner of the net from Sabo. But for the most part, I think this season, you know, the value from Sobo has come from a lot of the set pieces. He came close to assisting versus Brighton as well, but he generally has a lot of value there. And in recent weeks actually he's been back in you know in the thick of it with defcon. So you know even at that sort of role which you know we look at and frown upon a little bit with the right back position at times I think so provided to be a really good value. And something that I've mentioned too when it comes to looking at his numbers uh when you look at for example fantasies football hub and the opt stats there actually his numbers on a game-to-ame basis you know when he plays let's say an attacking mid position or a right back position have not been too dissimilar or too different rather and he actually looks relatively solid or stable I suppose in a lot of positions. He's not someone that I think has amazing underlying stats, but he is that classic FPL pick of does all the other stuff right like Defcon, like that sort of bonus element of things and just generally things like set pieces and of course, you know, is generally a high quality option in terms of the finishing through the direct set pieces. And I I think that that much is just clear, right? Just watching Saba play in the front line. I'll play Ekkit and Holland. This is, as I said with the provisor that I think Holland's fine from a benching perspective, I am planning to play Krooppy Jr. then Anderson, then Maguire. Part of the reason why Meguire's at the back my bench is I'm not really certain that he's going to start. I think Yoro had a really good sub on appearance and now it already kind of casts a little bit of aspersion into the Maguire pick and the quality of that pick that I've made. As I said though, I think Anderson, Timber Gabrielle can generally hold me out up until gaming 31. At that point in time in gaming 31, I might have to use another defensive transfer for the team. If I need to do so, I will. Richards is someone who's not going to play anyways. So, between him and Meguire, someone's going to go. It's also possible, I guess, with Dect still not close to coming back until I think probably at the end of this month or next month and maybe, you know, Euro still maybe not having the the faith car to play games in the future that Meguire can actually be called upon in the future. Uh, and I can play him versus, for example, Crystal Palace at home in the future, which I mentioned in the transfer plans video. I think I've mentioned in the future too many times, but one more time just for good measure. But that's that's an option sitting at the back for me. I almost think that he's not someone that I'm going to really waste a transfer at this moment in time for, but he could still come good for me. And this is probably the week where I think I've got equivalent or better options and there's no need to sort of risk potential poor minutes outcomes from a Maguire. I think Anderson is is closer similar. As far as the Kroopprippy Jr. in this case, I I I do still think that he's going to start this West Ham game. I could be completely wrong and I'd love to hear any sort of opinions on on people who have been closer to Bournemouth than myself as to you know what they think Krooy Jr's minutes are. I think this season I've generally read his minutes quite well but I am also a bit concerned that you know players like for example Adley and Ryan have really inserted themselves into the team and have been able to sort of prove that they can play 80 90 minutes which is a far cry from what groupy Junior has delivered. So I don't really see that Krooppy Jr. has naturally as high of a ceiling as we tend to think. Yes, of course, the ball striking is impressive. Um, but there are lots of sort of returns that you can get from players with a much higher floor that can probably on a weekly basis sort of supersede what Krooppy Jr. can do. So, to me, it's between Lefay, Anderson, and Krippy Jr. because I'm sort of backing an instance where I guess I'm already going for Lefay and riding with a Sunderland outcome. I think it makes sense to have Crooppy Junior first on bench just so that if let's say someone's not going to play within my team and maybe Holland for example, I don't mind so much if Krooppy Jr. comes into the team as an auto sub. We'll see whether I I I regret that. But that's kind of the general idea here. And that's going to be my team selection for this week. As far as captaincy, I don't think there's too much to discuss. I I think there's already some doubts with Holland. I really think that with with the exceptionally long break between the games that Chelsea will have because they're now in the top eight of the Champions League, there's no reason for me to kind of pass up on Cole Palmer captain. It's Burnley at home. It's the best fixture possible. He looked really lively versus leads. Yes, of course looking lively included missing an absolute sitter, but the reality I think is is that most of the things that we want from Cole Palmer are there. the creative element of the game like for example the Pedro assist that he gave not just for example the Pedro assist that he gave versus Napoli where he basically passed to J Pedro and J Pedro just scored a solo goal but creating great through balls and and a volume of chances taking defenders on all that kind of stuff. So I think that element of the game seems like it's you know revitalizing itself and part of that is just playing versus wor opposition and this is an opportunity to do so. Uh with Holland, yes, I think he's going to be the most popular captain this week, but the fact that I think I have a slightly better captaincy just means that it's an easy decision for me. So, Palmer captaincy for myself, vice captain on Holland. For other people and other managers, I I I still think I'd probably go for the Holland captaincy if I'm being completely honest. Um, say if I had a Salah, say if I, you know, still have Enzo on my team who also has a great game, I think I'd still pass up on that and go for the Holland captaincy. If if it seems like, you know, Pep gives him the all clear and that he's fit cuz once again, I think if Holland has an injury, you're not going to deal with a circumstance where he's coming off the bench, I would think. I I still think getting the rest in the FA Cup is good. If he's generally fit and good to go and not actually injured, he will be starting this game. And and Newcastle look like they're kind of there for the taking if I'm being completely honest. Not because the results have been significantly poor as of late, but I just think this is a pretty dire period for them. Um, they're a bit thin on personnel and, you know, City is still a very, very top attacking team and they're probably still the best attacking team that we have in the Premier League. So, there you have it in terms of my team selection. Let me know what your thoughts are. My my plans are generally quite consistent with the transfer plans video that I outlined in terms of, you know, the plan from gaming 28 and beyond. Um, still looking towards a wild card 32. Hoping to be able to roll a couple transfers, like at best maybe two transfers cuz I'll be realistic. I love using transfers. I think I've got scope to use transfers. Part of the reason why I went into Palmer is knowing that I was also going to go out of Palmer. So, it's very likely that I'll have less free transfers than other managers who might be, you know, rolling into a wild card 32. But I think I'm also willing to to accept that. Also, I think something that people have sort of neglected is for people who are low on transfers like myself, if you are comfortable with being able to sort of offload Holland, even if he's fit, say after Newcastle at home, moving Holland after this week is okay. It's not the most ideal thing because you still have West Ham games you're going to miss. I think a nodding force at home fixture as well, but he does save you a free transfer in terms of if you're planning to dead end into gaming 32 selling Holland maybe a little bit earlier could work out because ultimately you're going to consider I think the idea of let's say buying a top forward in gaming 31 and that could be Watkins for someone who actually is planning to sell Holland only on the blank but if you plan to sell earlier you know that that's that's a way for me that's a bit cute that I can keep Ekit with keep Thiago in the team with whereas I think that I I will sort of have to make decisions in terms of do I offload a Palmer, do I offload an Echo TK in the near future and that's not ideal for me. But just a just a thought, a closing thought in terms of my team selection, but this is going to be my team selection for this week. Looking forward towards the games ahead. Hope you guys enjoy the Wolves versus Arsenal game and I'll see you guys soon for more content. Take care and goodbye."

      "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome back to FPL Fran. Today's video is going to be my gameweek 27 transfer plans. It's a pretty interesting gameweek because I think of course coming out of the double which was so far pretty uneventful for me and I think still going to be uneventful. You know, I did triple captain which is something that I thought just logically made sense as I'm likely to use for example a bench boost on 33. Not so sure about what our options are on gameweek 36 in terms of a double game week. But, you know, the possibilities still seem pretty open towards someone like Holland, for example, having a double gameweek there. But yeah, I mean, all things being said, it it felt normal, I guess, to to play the triple captain, Gabrielle. So far, it hasn't really worked out. Admittedly, Arsenal did not play very well versus Brenford. I think Brenford actually, for the most part, dominated Arsenal in that match, and that's not, I think, something that we still naturally expected. the the chances that Brenford had I think were mostly the Thiago chance and then of course this piece that they eventually scored in with Lewis Potter scoring. But I think the bet in terms of Arsenal defense still generally made sense in the context of you know what the season is like with how good defenders are at least when they play for Arsenal and of course someone like Gabrielle who is multi-pronged in in that he can get give you Devcon give you you know maybe a goalc scoring return as it turns out of course you know nothing so far from Gabrielle but we still have the better game to come. Just from the outside of the video though, it just doesn't really matter. I mean, Gabriel's ownership is extremely high. I think people who captain Rice are moderately winning. People who might have maybe not even capped into double gameweek so far, I suppose, could be doing better. But it's been a pretty timid game week where I think, you know, a couple key players did haul. I have a player who has a light hole, I suppose, but players like Simeo, players like A Pedro or just at least the multitude of having two players who have, you know, got in a hole, for example, would have given you a good gaming so far. and that includes even someone like Jose Sa who pulled on a pretty miraculous performance versus Nottingham Forest. But yeah, that's kind of the context of the team. I succumbed to a Meguire hamstring injury and I think Yoro actually came off or came on the pitch and played relatively well versus West Ham. So, I'm kind of concerned about Meguire now feeling a little bit ill, I guess, watching Richards concede three goals to Burnley. uh and Maguire get nothing versus West Ham. Whilst Muki honestly had a very good performance versus Liverpool. I thought he was actually once again one of the key outlets of the team from an attacking point of view and was close to Defcon within that match. So maybe I've made the wrong decision. We'll see how it goes. I think the general plan from 27 to 31, as you guys will see later on in this video, is that I think for the most part owning Gabrielle Timber and Anderson is good enough as a defense in the future. and then when Richards has a blank game week, I can just make a transfer. I'm still not too worried about defense, but it's it's still the midfield in attack that needs work. Uh Thiago actually had ended up having better chances than EchitK did. And I do think EkitK's minutes are going to fall off a little bit. We'll talk about my transfer plans in a moment. Otherwise, Enzo once again sort of more creative as a threat. I think when Palmer, you know, is in the team. I don't think there's a direct knock on in terms of people saying that Enzo's incapable of, you know, getting points when Palmer's in the squad. he was a bit more of an assistive threat over the last two games and he hasn't really delivered on that whereas of course Palmer has overperformed in the sense that you know three penalties in two games and even the tapping I suppose at the end of the game where he missed that's that's just sort of the the thrills of the game I suppose with me very lucky of course to own Palmer Lefay didn't get defon Liverpool was close I think it was two defcon off so obviously was suspended so it's nice to have him back in the team he continues to sort of be compounding on his form so he's a player that I'm I'm quite happy to own Bruno we all own Holland we all own question mark we'll talk about that in a moment uh cuz he might have an injury and he did succumb an injury in the Fulham game where clearly I think he hit a knock in the first half after some contact with Anderson and we'll see how Pep sort of you know gives us updates in terms of his availability going forwards because yes there are some plans for people to go towards Salah and I think it's all fair and reasonable as long as Holland's out now if Holland isn't out then I think it it it goes down to sort of things like risk appetite Because for the most part, I think Salah has returned back to that usual stage of he's a 90-minute player for this Liverpool team. And we can talk about what that means because some people will still say and I think fairly we'll we'll say maybe with the exception to maybe let's say this recent Brighton game, the FA Cup, he still for the most part looked like a very timid player for what his price point is. Um but we'll we'll we'll jump into that in a moment. And otherwise I I felt positive I suppose that I I benched Krippy Jr. kind of felt like a benching could could happen and that was you know supported by the irreola quotes but I think that's a bit of a negative in with the backdrop being that well you know whilst the menu is gone for example Ryan has sort of come and joined the club he's dropped the 90-minute game already I mean Adley is playing you know 80 minutes a match and so I think in that context Junior hasn't really built more upon his form for example and it still seems like comfortable taking him off the pitch at 65 minutes which is not the best uh going forwards especially since he can even get rotated in the midweek as he was in gameweek 26. So that's kind of how I feel about my team. In terms of a quick review of the games, I thought Chelsea versus Leeds was a bit of a of a classic Chelsea game this season where they were quite dominant for most parts of the game, but then suddenly 5 to 10 minutes of mistakes and I guess general idiocy if you want to put it down to that means that Chelsea somehow drove that game. And of course they did miss a big chance at the end. Everton versus Bournemouth. Seems like Everton actually had a lot of chances. I didn't get to watch that game cuz it was simultaneous with the Chelsea game. But I feel like Bournemouth obviously have a lot of strong depth now. And as I talked about, you know, Adley and and Ryan are almost, you know, slightly ahead of the pecking order in terms of picking a Borneworth player over Evan Nilson over Krooppy as it seems. So they've sort of been compounding on that form. Everton otherwise. I mean, Nai got a penalty. And I I think people sort of reflect and sort of frown upon penalty takers. Reality is sometimes you own a penalty taker not to, you know, take over the game to dominate the game and and and to show flare like you'd probably expect FJI to do, but at the end of the day, if you're there on the pitch and you can take penalties and you do take penalties and your team gets a penalty, well, you get FPL points. And so that that's sometimes the I think the idiosyncrasy in the game in terms of lining up you know what you think is like a good footballing idea in terms of you know maybe not backing Everton's offense versus just simply okay NJ is a good pick because he's a penalty taker at any point in time as long as his minutes are good and so that's that for you I would say which we always tried to take a balance of right on the cheat sheet and my team included like I think Palmer for the most part up until the leads game was not exceptional I think in open play um But Chelsea I thought and and and specifically Palmer within that lead match was very impressive. So you know you you get to build upon that sometimes with easier fixtures. Spurs versus Newcastle. I mean Spurs have a new manager. Let's probably just wait and see what happens there. Probably going to move into a back three. I don't really know what that means in terms of roles. I think you'll probably see a bit more of maybe Kolmani and Seleni and then maybe Simon's I guess you know moving more interior but I am not going to touch Spurs for the moment. And for Newcastle, I still think they're a bit thin on depth and they're about to run into a period where they're playing playoff football as well within the Champions League. I'm not particularly high on them, even though they had a great result versus Aston Villa as well in the FA Cup. So, let's see what happens. The run isn't particularly great, but you know, we can revisit Newcastle players as a bit of a one-off option in gaming 31. And at the same time, I think a lot of people have held on to picks like Chaw and have gotten rewarded for that. So, congrats. West Hammers United. I think West Ham continue to be showing some really good form. This is probably the the first iteration of United playing versus a true low block team and they struggled. Cesco had got a great finish. West Ham didn't have the most of chances but still probably more conclusive than United and you know they got the game state that they really wanted and tried to sort of I think bunker down and you know were I think a bit unfairly you know rewarded with that that that Cesco sensational finish. So let's see how United continue to build on probably the first blip in terms of Carrick's tenure but I don't think the worst thing in the world I would like to see if Saskco starts the next game and I think that has impacts on Kuna's minutes otherwise I think over towards the West Ham camp you still probably could feel like okay the key players are Bowen Fernan and also Somerville who all look really really good Aston Vis Brighton I can't say too much about this game because I did I think watch the city Fulham game as well at the Yeah, I mean these matches weren't particularly eventful. I think Famachi had a lot of chances for City and City came up looking really good. The irony I suppose is in recent memory O'Reilly has pretty much claimed a spot within the midfield for his own alongside Bernardo Silva who's pretty much has to be played when he can be available. Um so O'Reilly has opened himself back to being a pretty good pick in FPL. Doesn't make too much sense especially you know with people looking at Semeno as well as these players blank game 31. I guess with the context of if you think that these players are going to overperform some of the competing picks in this in competing price points over the next few games then then of course there's some value there right to go to going back into a semen to going back into maybe an eco rally. I personally think that you can skirt away from them and they could still end up sort of being on par with some of the top picks in the game and then you save yourself a free transfer. But I can also see the attitude that people will have which is that City actually looked like a pretty good team. You know in a in a in a game I suppose or in a league where a lot of the teams are struggling for chances for you know genuine attacking quality that maybe City is still a team that you can trust more overwhelmingly than other teams. And I I can understand that logic with Forest versus Wolves. I think Forest had plenty of chances. A bit unfortunate that yeah Big Sean's lost his job but yeah I don't know. I mean, I think there's not much to be said in terms of any real interest in FPL in in any of these teams outside of a double other than, of course, Elliot Anderson getting a lot of ball recoveries, but we can just move on shortly. Uh, Palace versus Burnley. I I think the reflection here is still a bit of an unfortunate game. Sure, I think the the common takeaway is any team that concedes three goals to Burnley is a bad team. And I can understand that argument. At the same time, I think five shots were taken this game. Five shots were scored. The chances weren't the best I would say. Like a lot of good chances, good finishes, I might add, as well. And I think even for example for John Larson, I'm not overly optimistic with his performance individually in that game. Other than he took his chances really well. It's not like Crystal Palace actually overwhelmed Burnley with the quality of chances like they have in previous games from an attacking point of view. Uh and at the same time, of course, Burnley kind of just, you know, they have their finishing boots and that's pretty much it plus the own goal. Sunderland versus Liverpool. I think Liverpool very much deserve a result. The takeaway there I think is Liverpool do seem like a very solid team I would say as of late. Um I think they're definitely building upon some element of form especially control at the back as well. I just think they're conceding less chances and that's a positive of course for people who've kept Virgil. I clearly haven't and now I suppose I'm looking back and and and regretting I'm not winning Virgil. But I think the the interesting piece with Liverpool is that they're about to jump into another great run. So of course you have the chance to re-evaluate going for all the picks there which include ver which is includes Virgil but there's plenty of options I think you know with Sabo with WZ with Ekit Tik still to an extent tough to say cuz I think fortunately Liverpool's fixtures don't get impeded by Champions League up until gaming 2930 that sort of period but I still think that I'm you know I I still prefer a Thiago for example over Neutique at this moment in time and I'm obviously the owner of Nekit but Salah definitely still is even someone who's quite prominent And then of course in defense I think Virgil's probably the most dominant pick, the most obvious pick, but Kate not too shabby as well. And Brenford versus Arsenal we talked about at the start of the episode. So that's sort of my summary of the week. I don't think Wolves versus Arsenal will change my opinion whatsoever in terms of the league. But in terms of like things that I would take away as a positive going forwards, I I do think yeah, there's value to definitely moving more of our assets towards Liverpool. Maybe it's even just getting a defender. I think we've always mentioned that Sunderland is actually a very solid defense. So I'm not too, for example, concerned about, okay, did Liverpool not create enough chances versus Sunderland. At the same time, I also think that City result was a bit flattering. Once again, I mean, Fulham and Leno, to be honest, I think we can probably single him out as being a pretty poor keeper last two seasons in terms of shots stopping. Um, if you go back any sort of year before the last two seasons, I think Leno has always been a top goalkeeper, but I think we're we're a long ways away from that. And that's pretty much my sort of takeaways from this week. I I think there's a pretty big Brenford fixture run coming and they're the team that we should almost entirely put our focus on because there's value there and I think Liverpool also coming out of gaming 27 you know 28 onwards that sort of path is another great run for them as well. So those two teams I have my eyes on. So shifting gears towards my transfer plans now for Gaming 27 here with the Fantasy Football Hub my team pick and rating tool. It's the tool that I use every week to sort of sort my transfer out. make sure that I generally speaking have a good team that I'm fielding out every week to sort of give myself the best chance possible of getting these green arrows. Of course, you don't tend to get the green arrows when you expect them, but I think generally speaking, the loose idea of putting out a good team forwards and that rewarding you over time, maybe over seasons is is the the prevailing logic that we're living with here. In gaming 27, I think I've got a very solid team. The main concern, I think, is you know, what is going on with Holland and and which players do I play? Now, I don't think Magguire is actually going to play Everton away. Maybe I'm wrong and maybe we'll get some news on on him with Carrick, but I'm I'm almost tempted to just say Krooppy Junior's minutes might not be perfect versus West Ham. West Ham have generally been in a better state. I'm not so confident as I said in Magguire versus Everton away in his minutes there. I'll have to kind of see what happens. Maybe I'm wrong and and you know, I'll take that call, but I don't think there's a massive swing in terms of the expected points between any of the players that I could play over Magguire. And at the same time, we kind of just want to watch out for Holland use. I think on the on the assumption that Holland is fine, I'm going to go with transfer path number one here and talk about what happens if if Holland's fine and I want to take a bit more of a passive route. So I think the most logical play here is in gaming 27 to get a little bit more information. Yes, that means I'm probably one week late in terms of Brenford transfers. It means that I probably have the opportunity to consider a little bit more deeply Liverpool transfers. On the flip side, I think I'm I'm very invested into a very very good Chelsea game. So Palmer or captaincy is definitely on the cards. I will be going for it. And Enzo, of course, this is a great game for him, too. So, you know, not necessarily needed to to to force transfers into these Brenford players just yet, but it could be done. The way I kind of see it is I probably will play someone between Anderson and Lefay. Just betting on one team that I think will do well. You know, with Sunderland doing generally quite well with at home with exception to that last match versus Liverpool. I think I I still quite like playing Lefay. Interestingly, in the FA Cup, Diara did take the penalty, which I think a lot of people who were kind of punting on El's penalty share kind of were aware that, you know, when Diara was to come back into the game that he could take the next penalty. The last quote that he had on this, and I think Rob T shared this on on his FPL Twitter account, was Lefay basically mentioned that him and Diara do share penalties. So maybe, you know, the next penalty could still be Lefay, but I would almost think that Diara could still continue to take as he hasn't missed recently. And yeah, that's pretty much my thoughts on that. I think I'll probably play Lefay. So that means I'll probably bench Magguire. Would be nice to get a little bit more news in terms of whether Magguire actually sustained a genuine hamstring injury or, you know, he he I don't know, had a knock, I suppose, within that West Ham match and he's totally fine. But this is probably how I'm going to play my team in terms of the bench order as well. Could be Anderson over Groupy just for the chance of Defcon. And ultimately still, I think any anytime you get to play, for example, a team like Sunderland, the clean sheet odds will be generally quite high because the the the attack is still not for the most part that elite. So that's kind of how I feel about my team in gaming 27. Giving 28, this is the the team or or the gameweek rather where I plan to make a lot of transfers. And going back to that point in terms of, you know, thinking about whether Magguire's useful or not, it would be lovely if Meguire was available for Crystal Palace at home cuz I think that's such a good fixture now, especially since Palace still for the most part to me look a bit toothless in terms of the attack. Um, I'd love to make two free transfers here. As you can see, of course, Thiago's missing, Dango's missing. I've even got Palmer with a pretty mediocre fixture. So, something that I've been thinking about is if I really want to go super aggressive, I think that I could still do Thiago in and then Enzo out for MoSalah. Um, and you know, yes, of course, I'm taking Holland out of my team, but I think I'm not going to captain Holland for the next few weeks. I have a Salah captaincy for most of the fixtures up until the blank game week. And in the blank game week, it's very likely or possible that I would want to have someone that's not Holland in my team. I think that this decision is a bit brash, some people would say, but I don't really mind that sort of level of of of risk in terms of not having Holland, especially after Newcastle at home is gone. I almost think that's one of the better games. Notting Force at home will be a bit painful to miss out. Same with West Ham. But it all it is sort of what it is in the sense that I think if Holland's minutes look shaky at all like for example if he's sort of playing with a knock consistently now through up until game 31 and you've got European fixtures as well that city will be taking you know participation towards I I do almost think that Holland could be someone that you can arguably sell if you have the risk appetite to do so. I'm not saying Salah is an amazing pick, but I I like the idea of it. And then of course, I think that's going to be my team for a few weeks out here up until something like a gameweek 31 where of course finally here I have a pretty poor team, right? I've got Richards, I've got Gabrielle, I've got Timber. Um, ideally I want to make at least one or two free transfers to make the team a little bit better in gaming 31. I'm not going to really make the transfers here defensively of course on Gaming 31. If you're planning to do a wild card 32, which is my general strategy, Newcastle defenders are interesting. Some Aston Villa picks are interesting as well. So that's going to be transfer path number one. Transfer path number two is, you know, what happens if Holland's out this week, right? So I think the immediate move is actually just to to once to do basically the moves that I would have done but just a bit earlier, right? So Thiago and gave me 27. No need to really rush into MoSalah here, but then give me 28. We jump straight into MoSalah from Enzo and that's an option. Another transfer that I actually quite like doing is if I make this move on gaming 29, I can always go for Dango here, Uara here with through Enzo Lefay, which is something that I could do even in the original path, right? So just going back to my transfers in path number one, that Enzo Lefay to Dango move makes a lot of sense to me in my head and give me 29, especially if Junior's minutes don't look excellent, right? So for example, if around this fixture run where groupy junior's got Brenford at home, Burnley away and Man United at home, if he doesn't seem to be playing that 65 minutes per game that we usually expect from him, I think having Dango every week instead is much better and I think still much better than let's say Enzo Lefay and what he can bring to the table. So that's something to think about. And then of course roll into gaming 31 where I've got a decent team and probably two free transfers to kind of fix this the squad which in reality I think just probably needs one defender and it's good to go if Meguire is fine. Now, if Magguire is not fine, that's two free transfers that I have to spend, but I'm not going to spend too much mental energy thinking about that because it's it's just too far away. So, that's transfer path number two. Transfer path number three is, you know, a little bit more of a safer path, but equally, I think also quite an aggressive path. I think that there is an opportunity for me to do something like maybe go EkitK out for Thiago. This is if I think Holland's perfectly fine. And also I think in a world where let's say if I look at ekitk's minutes maybe is around the corner maybe champions league is going to hurt his minutes in 2930 and I don't really want ek it doesn't really feel right because Liverpool's fixtures do look so good but it does allow me to kind of keep Holland I suppose within the team and then use Palmer as the make weight going forward. So, it's an aggressive move 27 and then I think maybe probably going to be backed up by another very aggressive move 28 where instead of actually keeping Palmer, I think I just move towards Salah here and also move out um someone like an Enenzo here into a Dango. The reason why this move would would probably make sense for me is if I'm going to be quite aggressive, I might as well not back Chelsea at all because the fixture run is poor. I don't really mind taking a hit with all the advantage that I've gotten from the Palmer points. Uh reinserting that into Salah with really good fixtures is kind of like putting myself in the same situation that I had two weeks ago when I brought Cole Palmer where okay, Salah might not be the best player, but this is still a player with a really good fixture run playing versus much worse opponents. Therefore, things like penalties, set piece assists, even just general open play value will will increase. And so Salah makes a lot of sense as a play. I would keep Holland here. probably be defensive against, you know, all the other teams in the world who can't afford Salo plus Holland and I still have that sort of advantage of, you know, the double premium here without too much cost on my team. So, that's something that I quite like, but I think it's also a little bit dependent on, you know, is Magguire useful, things like that. Because, as you can see, even on a week like this, I'd probably be quite reliant on, you know, playing, let's say, an Enzo Lefay or playing a Krooppy Jr. So I'm not sure if I love this move the most, but this does give me a Salah plus Holland path and it is quite interesting on Gaming 29 because I guess I've gone so deep into the Brenford transfers. There aren't really transfers to be made I suppose at this point in time but once again this team is a little bit more reliant on the edge players like the groupy juniors, the Maguiars or you know even if I just want to continuously play Lefay who might not have you know the best penalty share at this moment in time. So this is sort of path number three. I don't think it's the worst path, but another issue I suppose is when, you know, come gaming 31, it does put myself in a bit more of a trickier position where, you know, I do have to suddenly use a lot more free transfers to kind of fix the team just to field out an 11 here now, especially as well if Meguire is not available. So, that's something to think about. I I'm not entirely sure if I'm going to follow through with this path, but I do like it from the perspective of if I I want to move away from someone like Palmer who who his minutes could be quite iffy. Ecatig as well as I said could be quite iffy when Europe comes around. Having players like Salah and maybe Holland to an extent probably are slightly more minutes impervious compared to let's say a Palmer right now with the kind of season that he's having and that also Nekit who clearly just can't play three fixtures a week. Holland can for the most part but of course he's in his sort of own moment this season where he's struggling. So I appreciate that people will find that not not not quite like sort of sensemaking as logic but I think you know we can see a world where let's say Holland just has a knock versus Fulham and he's good to go for the rest of the fixtures whereas I can kind of see a Palmer and ITK dropping minutes regardless right because as you can see for example even on this week you can see Palmer fully rested for the FA Cup Ekit coming off the bench was a bit different versus Brighton but still the fact that he has to come off the bench versus Brighton kind of shows you how much slot kind of prefers giving him the rest that he needs as he's the soul full striker of the team at this moment in time. So, that's going to be transfer path number three. Let me know what your thoughts are. I do think that all the paths are quite interesting. Now, some of it's just going to be what the information is available to us at the time of the gaming 27 deadline. Like, if we think Holland is out injured, then of course, I just go straight towards Thiago a little bit earlier. Um but I think paths number one and two are generally a path which is going to be me going for Palmer plus Salah which I think is a bit more aggressive in terms of risk profile as I said but could make sense especially if I have any sort of uncertainty over Holland at all and maybe you know with the context that I've already added like Palmer I suppose is building on fitness um Holland is is as I said in a moment where he's kind of suffering with his own injuries and yeah we'll see what happens but Salapas Han is also interesting because from a perspective of squeezing absolutely every inch out of my budget. This is also something that can be done, right? So, let me know what your thoughts are. Uh would love to hear you guys and hope you guys are having a good game 26. Let's look forward towards this Arsenal versus Wolves game. As I said though, unless of course Declan Rice drops an absolute masterpiece of a game in Arsenal defense, you know, get completely robbed. Not robbed, I mean, they can they can play poorly as they have. Um but yeah, if nothing comes out of Gabrielle triple captaincy, then then then fair play to anyone who's gone for a rice triple captain or anyone else. and I'll see you guys next week in game 27. So, take care and goodbye and I'll see you guys soon."

      "transcript": "Hey everyone, hope you guys are doing well. Just let me know if the uh the live stream works and the audio is fine. But we are live for the deadline. Uh going to be making my moves now. Um just going to quickly shift my team and then we'll just get started uh to be quite honest. Um all right. So, what do we want to do? Yeah, I think I think I'm going to keep So, I think I'm going to sell Muki. I think I'm going to buy Timber. Um I mean, Rice was there, but you know, Cal Fury's there as well. But I think these are the most logical moves. Um it's kind of hard to to kind of skip by these moves this week. And yeah, so that's muk to timber done and then we're going to activate the triple captain chip right now. No, I've not used any chips up until today, of course. Wait, what did I just press? Um, get the captaincy right. and we want to play Timber over Krooppy. So, that's going to be my team, Vice Captain Timber. Um, and if we make any sort of 50-50 decisions over the course of the stream, we will, but you know, I I'll get back to discussing chat and people's moves in a moment. Um, yeah, I think that's it. Cool. So, let's just jump into chat. Uh, hi every Friday evening. Triple captain is a lock. Yep, it is done. Um, from a kind of team perspective, I think it just made sense. I think I'm in a pretty good spot in the season. So, you know, this is not technically a differential captaincy, but at the same time, I think with the effective ownership of the AR, like sorry, the differential captaincy of having uh Gabrielle with all the Arsenal effective ownership kind of made sense for me. Um, I think there will be other opportunities later in the season. I think people are kind of dismissing how good one single game captaincy, for example, versus Burnley at home could be. Um, you know, like even arguably a Palmer captaincy in two weeks time, I don't think is actually too far out, for example. Um, but you know, people want news on gaming 33 and 36 and and I think there's decisions to be made there. Um, got to super chat from Salm. Thank you so much for the super chat, my friend. Franhill, please. I already played wild card and now I have free uh three transfers. Would you buy Richards and then bench Sessi? Um, I mean Sessi versus Everton away. I wouldn't buy Richards personally. Uh, yes, of course it's if you could do something like Munos, I maybe would have considered it, but I just think that going down to Richards is not that necessary. He's going to be a transfer in the future. I think get ahead of the curve next week. You know, get more uh Brenford players, get maybe even considering in the midfield position, I'd probably go Sar. I think Sness is still very very good going forwards, which is why I don't think the value towards Richards over these two weeks should be kind of u passed up for the value of Sessi overall. So, just a point to be made there. Um yeah. Lacro Richards for a twoe punt. I'd probably go Lacrosse to be honest. I still think end of the day he probably actually is a slightly better setpiece target than than than Richards. Uh even though Richards of course scored the most recent goal. They're close but I would still probably take LRA. And you know, ultimately also comes down to whether you actually need any sort of value from um that 0, let's say, six gap between the two players. Uh did I consider Timber at Triple Captain? Not really. No. I think most weeks I'd always rather have Gabrielle than Timber. Part of of that is Defcon. Um part of that is I I I do think that Timber sort of goal threat is a little bit overstated. Um but I could be wrong. Um yeah, we can check Discord of course in a moment. Um, obviously I've just come back from work, so I haven't really had time to respond to to anything. Triple Captain Rice is interesting. I think it it's kind of a bet against the field. I actually like it more than the Timber Captaincy from a risk perspective, but I can also understand why people, you know, like the Timber Captain cuz if you're someone who subscribes to XG, um, you know, he's obviously had slightly better numbers than, for example, even a Rice. I'm sure to quickly have a look at Discord chats in a moment. Um, so you got five free transfers, uh, Kashif. So, let's have a look at your team. I mean, I think Ekkit TK is fine, man. Your team's still really good. I mean, I'd probably consider making a Turkey move. Like maybe could you do something like Turkey to to Ismeia Sar then you could bench Thiago something like that and then maybe you can downgrade Taroski to someone else. Oh and you still need to pick up Oh, you know you do you do have triple arsenal so that's fine. Maybe it's time to just cuz if you can if you can go SAR surely you have a little bit more money in the bank, right? I think going SAR makes sense in your position. This way you can just justify benching Thiago and I think the rest of the team is fine. In fact, you can probably roll the rest of the transfers. Taroski, Gui, and Gabrielle should carry you this week. Um, you can afford Munos as well from Taroski. I'd probably do both. Yeah, I' I'd do both. Um, only because you're on five free transfers. So, for example, anyone in the chat as well, I mean, this is a manager who's got five free transfers. That's where I think going for the Crystal Palace players makes a lot of sense. um even the defenders or maybe Ismear in the midfield. Um I even think for some managers I guess if you have like a if you have triple Arsenal and you can still go towards Palmer for two weeks, it's not the worst thing in the world if you have somewhere between let's say three to five transfers, which I think is highly unlikely, but if you're somehow in the circumstance where you have this uh kind of benefit, you can go for that. Um going back to chat though and the super chat from Jimmy Boy as well. Thank you so much for that. Lefay for Rogers and Kuna for Palmer. So interesting. So, another manager who's kind of I kind of think I'd probably go Kuna for Palmer. Uh, cuz I think Lefay is actually a pretty good hold going forwards and I I guess the differential aspect of Palmer does help. Um, I would hope that you have a couple more free transfers cuz something I would say is that Lefay for Rogers is a move that kind of benefits you for a longer term. So, for example, you won't be transferring out Rogers in a few weeks time. You'll be holding him up until all the way basically until uh blank gaming 31 and then gaming 32 your wild card may be out of Rogers. So, if you have less free transfers, I'd probably opt for the Rogers move. If you have more, I don't really mind you going Palmer and then sort of reorientating your team a little bit. I'm just going to quickly try to skim through as many chat questions as well. I think I hopefully I've not missed any super chats. Um, let me just yeah have a look at some member chats as well. Anish, nice to see you around. Kashif, I have responded to you. So, hail, nice to see you, my friend. Uh, EY2383. Sia for hit or Kal Fury for free. I'd probably actually just tempt myself with color fury. I don't think Celiba naturally has an extremely high ceiling, so I quite like Kal Fury even if it's 65 minutes at a time. Uh Nabadip, thank you so much my friend. Um top 100. That's the dream. Let's see if we can do it. Uh play to VB or DCL. That was uh Ivan Luca's question. Um I would personally play, man, I think I would just about play Van um and kind of hope for the best with a home game there. Um, Robert TG, thank you so much for renewing as a member for 16 months as a manager as well. Would you play Cash over Meguire/Hill? Uh, I would play Cash over Hill. I'm not sure about Cash versus Magguire. I think that's more of a 50/50 to be honest with Hill. I I think yes, of course, he's he's been quite good with Defcon. Um, but you know, the the problem I suppose is um it's I mean, I'd back my my players with a home fixture to be honest, right? And Cash Magguire I feel like have a bit more goal threat as well. So on this week, I kind of like them. Uh, notorious wrestler. No, no worries about the super chat, my friend. Uh, just drop a message and I'll respond to it. So, thank you so much for supporting the channel anyways. Um, really do appreciate that. Uh, 911, thank you so much for your super chat. Start Ballard/Van Heck. Um, I would probably start Dan Ballard. Um, two reasons. I think the clean sheet odds for both Brighton and um, Sunderland are really poor. So, I think you're, you know, they're both not the best options, but then actually at at the end of the day, Ballard is a bit better on Defcon. So, I think I would go with Ballard. And he actually has a bit more goal threat, although I know Van Hex had a couple jammy holes this season. Other than Arsenal defense, who would you captain? I mean, Rice is still fine. I think if you have an attacker you actually believe will actually play both games, I I don't really mind it to be honest. It's just hard to make that call because they do have a lot of depth. Um, HJ Warman saying, \"To Gabrielle or VG?\" I'm so sorry, but like who who is VG? Have I lost my mind? Who's VG? Victor Gokres, right? Of course. Um, I think I'd go Gabrielle personally. I mean, I I can't guarantee that Gokes is going to start both games. I think that's a bit much. And also, the minutes might not even be there. Um, we can definitely look at your Discord question on rating your teams. Thank you, James, for sending through that super chat. Um, I'm also going to answer a couple chat questions if some people are like some private chat questions as well because unfortunately I'm not around but as in I I wasn't around earlier today. But in terms of rating your team um so this was your question right James uh roll or talk to Munos two free trans 1.7 in the bank I probably would do to Munos cuz I think Ambbeo Rice Ro like yeah your actual midfield can be kept basically perpetually your defense is actually still fine Rhdon are great for for the blank as well so yeah I think you're fine actually to make that move and be a bit more aggressive I quite like that in your position I do think or starts Uh minus four so to SAR I don't think it's worth a minus four. Um starting AL actually I'd still start Alderete to be honest. I think keeping Sabo after this week is actually very good while Lefay over Krooppy just uncertain about Krooppy's minutes I guess like maybe Krooppy play 65 minutes but there's also a chance that they can rotate a bit. um he's been playing generally quite well recently and yeah I mean I think the the net advantage anyways of let's say um playing Lefay is that he's going to guarantee the minutes I think Liverpool are a touch weaker obviously with some of the injuries and stuff um and then of course you know Sabo being out um so yeah I I kind of like just getting a defcon and getting a little bit more of a floor to be honest Alex thank you so much for your question um start one of Wilson O'Reilly Thiago I would probably back O'Reilly. It's Fulham at home. I think he starts. I think he's actually got the best fixture. So, in this condition, I'd probably just play him. Uh Wilson vers DCL to start. I probably would still go with uh Harry Wilson if I'm honest. Jangster saying, \"Hey, Fran, thoughts about TC Timber.\" Part of the reason why I'm not so high on on Calbert Leuen is this sort of illness news. I don't know if like for example um yes of course you can probably make the mention that they're not going to risk him but then there's also an opportunity where he just simply plays poorly and comes off the pitch a little bit earlier even if he's going to start. So I don't think it's as simple as that. Uh Edgar, thank you so much for joining as a captain of the channel. Really appreciate that my friend. Uh thoughts about TC Timber? I mean I like it. If you if you really think that for example Timber is really due this attacking return uh now you can go for it. But um I I still think at the end of the day Gabriel is probably a better pick than Timber outright. Um, if you disagree with that, then of course you can just go Timber. I suppose I'm still on TC Gabrielle. I can definitely have a look at Discord now. Uh, in terms of chat questions. Um, Robert TG like your your team. Uh, Vivid or Thiago? Question from Kim. I think I would play uh Van Dijk to be honest this week. Uh, Petravich over Dravki. Yes. Uh, looking at your team, if I could see it, I think Ivan, I think your benching's fine. I'd probably play Vander. I'd play Vanab Ben over Carloin personally. That's the only thing I would do with your team, but it's close. Uh, Dr. Yazan, let's see your team. So, um, okay. So, you've got Keen who could still be playing football. You've got Gabrielle and Chaloba who are fine. So, that's a back three. You've got a 352. You don't need to touch your team at all. Um, you've got such a good team, Dr. Yan. I've got to be honest. Like, that's a better team than me by far. Um, yeah. I Yeah, fair enough. I mean, I think if you want to cover the risk of Keen, maybe you could go Munos. Keen to Munos, I think, actually makes sense in your position. Personally, I would go Keen to Munos. Don't run the risk of Keen, for example, getting benched for whatever reason. I'd probably go Keen to Munos. That seems to make sense. Um, all right, back to chat questions because we don't have too much time now. 17 minutes left. Have I missed any super chats as well? Also, I did read your question, Louis. So, uh, no, thank you for that one. Uh, Salem saying, \"One more, Sinsy.\" Definitely, uh, Sessi, just because the minutes are there. Everton's not a particularly good attack, so I quite like him, Salem. So, thank you once again for the super chats. Uh, Notorious, I actually saw I I can see the chat message from a member's perspective. Uh, so I can see the test message, but thank you so much. Uh, Caprill 43, play to Hill, Krooppy, Anderson, Echitique. Um, I would play Hill over Krooppy still. I would def you know, I would play Anderson, EkitK. If you could play the two of them, I would just go for it. Ekit, I think I'd still play over Krooppy and Hill. Anderson, I definitely he's got a pretty good game. His his kind of floor, I think, is still higher than naturally a defender because defenders can still concede. Uh, and Krooppy once again, I think his ceiling's technically high because of course, like we know, he's he's a he's a genuinely serious goal threat, but then I think the floor is also quite low, and I don't think it's really worth it, for example, in a game that looks a bit more mediocre from the kind of expected goal uh aspect of things from from Bournemouth, right? Uh, Luhar N, thank you so much for the super chat. Sorry if I mispronounced your name. Do let me know if you um prefer other uh pronunciations. I don't really like the Japedra move, especially since you're going to move out of Chaloba. Um, I don't think it's really worth it. DCL to JSL I'm not sure of if I'm completely honest cuz cuz I just my concern really is that it's a bit temperamental and Mateta's also been announced to kind of not have surgery. Um, I don't know. Would you consider for example going for a Wolves forward potentially if you're just going to go that sort of one aggressive move? I guess JSL will serve you for two weeks, but then even after that, I'm not sure if JSL is that good of an option, especially if you consider that the minutes are poor and also that he's probably not on penalties. So, I actually would consider DCL to to actually just keeping DCL. I think keeping DCL is actually a very solid move. Yes, of course, it makes your team look bad for gaming 26, but that's kind of not what the game of FPL is, right? The point of owning DCL is that you're owning a player who's actually very good. And the advantage of owning DCL is is is going to be felt after he plays Chelsea, not not necessarily this week. So there is some advantage in my opinion just simply keeping DCL. It is what I would prefer doing. Um Jackson, thank you so much for your super chat. Would you go so to Anderson to get Timber? Um yeah, I I think you do need to get towards Timber, but if the alternative is you can do something like going for Cal Fury, I actually don't mind that. Um, so yeah, that's something I would say there. But if you have to um get timber and for example, you're already priced out of Califury for the same reason, then then I can understand the solo sale. Um, Shbam, thank you so much for your super chat. JP plus Hill or Ki plus Munos in three free transfers. So my concern is that you're going to send yourself towards zero free transfers by making all these moves. And if you go for two Palace players, then you're going to have to transfer them out in the future. So they're both transfers out. Um I kind then again I guess J Pedro's a similar case because Chelsea's fixtures do drop off a cliff. I personally would just go Krooppy plus Sar plus Muno. You know what? Because I guess JP is quite a natural placeholder for Thiago. If you don't own Thiago or even for someone around that sort of price point that could still be quite decent. Maybe I'll actually prefer JP plus R plus Hill um a little bit more because Sar I think is someone that you can continue to hold even as the fixtures get a bit worse for Palace. Um and then with Jao Pedro I think I'd rather probably be holding Jao Pedro so that I can transfer him out to another forward position. Whereas with Kroo I guess you're kind of pricing yourself out of forwards. With Munos I would say in a few weeks time he doesn't have necessarily a like for like replacement in the defensive position that I actually love that much. So, I feel like if I'm going to sell one of them, I'd rather have a like forl like replacement the forward position at the same price point as uh J Pedro. So, I'd go there. Uh Joe Diego, thank you much for your super chat. Nice to see you around again, my friend. Um I didn't like Palmer. Um like Fran, otherwise you'd be double D ranked. I mean, you you're having amazing season. So, I personally think at the sort of rank you're at, I I think it kind of makes sense. Oh, if if you're not playing it this game week, well, once again, a lot of people in chat have been talking about triple captaincy already. So the idea of course is and I think FPL made video actually really capitalized it well. First of all I think you need to understand that actually there's going to be a lot of top players who still have a good single game left right. So for example someone like Holland will still play Burnley away. Um you know even if that doesn't actually land in a double um other players like for example I mean even Palmer in in two weeks time you know he'll be playing um sorry not in two not two weeks time in one week's time will we will play Burnley at home. So there's a couple big players with some good games left on the singles, right? So that's an alternative opportunity. And I think the expected value for those types of players is probably somewhere around maybe somewhere between seven to kind of nine expected points if they kind of play the full match. Um probably I would say, you know, closer towards that sort of eight eight range. Uh whereas the expected value for a lot of the defenders this week from Arsenal um or even like let's say Declan Rice is probably somewhere around 10 to 11 points. So I don't think you're missing too much right in terms of that opportunity cost. Now, of course, there's a potential advantage in terms of some of the other doublers that you can get. Um, one being Bruno and gaming 33, the other being Holland on either 33 or 36. Holland, if he does have doubles in 36, which seems a bit, you know, unlikely now, but probably 25 30% chance of having having this happen. Um, could have a really good double game 36. So, that's the alternative opportunity. And of course, that's the alternative that you'd prefer having, right, as as a bet against because it it is the likelihood that you'll play bench boost on 33 if you're setting up with a conventional wild card 32 strategy. Now, if you don't plan on doing that, then of course gaming 33 is open to you and suddenly something like Bruno makes sense. Uh, private 5802, thank you so much for your super chat. Timber and play Alderet/Van Hec or minus 4 Munoz plus Kala Fury. Nah, definitely play definitely Timber and just play one of your players, you know. I think put uh Alderrete over Van Hec just similar reason to kind of Ballard where you can get potential higher chance of getting Defcon. So that's definitely what I would do. Dpack nice to see my friend. Sell Sabo to Zubie/Sar or sell to Munos. I would go to Al to Munos because I think so is actually a really good hold going forwards. Anonyi Z thank you so much for joining as a member of the channel. Welcome to captain my friend. Uh Farborer uh thank you so much for your super chat. Bench to Thiago Krooy Taroski Harry Wilson. I think I'd bench Harry Wilson and I think I'd bench Krooppy. So that means I play Thiago and Taroski. I just think these players are nailed more minutes. Bit of a defcon ceiling with Tarosski compared to let's say Harry Wilson who has a tough fixture and doesn't. Um and Thiago is kind of similar to Harry Wilson in that he has a bad fixture but at least he's playing at home. Uh and then he's got the penalties to back that up. Um Jerry Curry, thank you so much for your super chat. Bench one of JP ETK, Elliot Anderson or Semano? Wow, that's a tough question. probably honestly I think I would bench Elliot Anderson because I think yes you can argue he's got a high floor but you know I guess touch that ceiling right and just bench Ellie Anderson and hope it's not the worst thing ever. Uh Jonno Miller thank you thank you so much for your super chat and by the way 638 of you guys in the chat thank you guys for supporting if you do enjoy the content so far and as I said if you haven't watched my videos previously the cheat sheet series is something that I'm super proud of in terms of epil content that I deliver week to week. So, um, do have a look out for that if you can. Um, but yeah, Jon Miller, thank you. Thank you so much for your super chat. I can't see your message, but I'll be looking out for it immediately. Lord Baylor saying cash or hill. Cash not pictured in training. Well, I think if Cash is not pictured in training, just play him first and if he doesn't play, then he comes for Hill, right? I think it's very unlikely for players who are actually genuinely injured for them to actually, let's say, come off the pitch and then play. Um, so if you think about it, for example, if you think Hash is out, I think you start him and he doesn't play and you just get Hill. um is the best way to play around that. O'Reilly to Munos for a free. I'd probably consider doing that move. Um but I would like you to have a couple more free transfers in the bank if it works. Uh lots of questions in chat. Thank you guys so much for the activity. Do appreciate that. Palmer or Rice. Um I would go for triple Arsenal for now. So I would probably back going for Rice now unless you can do something like going for Palmer plus another defender for example. Uh thoughts on Kuna can't afford and Bumo. I actually probably would just go Amadello personally. Uh Anishh, thank you so much for your message. Fran super chat error. Could you see my team in chat? Yeah. Um, you're going to drop it in the chat message. Um, I think I was also going to look for one of Jono's messages. Um, which I think, you know, Jonno, you dropped a super chat. If you could drop a message in chat, I'll still probably be able to have a look at it. Uh, in the meantime though, uh, TFA Dare, thank you so much for your super chat. Hey, Frani here. Nice to see you, my friend. Vivid to Munos, Bench Wilson or Consa. Good streamer as always. I would bench Wilsa and play Consa. hope for the best there cuz I think it's actually a really good fixture for um what seems like a pretty toothless Brighton team as of late. Um and going for con here it does feel of course you know a bit worse sometimes playing a defender especially a defender who's not particularly good at defcon but um you know to an extent I think I mean this is city at home still so I kind of like just the the the risk of just playing Con here. Uh, Munos I I quite like. But similar similar caveats to how I've answered other people's questions in terms of I do think Munos is quite a it's quite a good transfer, right? Like it's just flatout good. It's a but it is a luxury transfer. So I I would say if you have some free transfer cushion, it makes a bit more sense. Um, Tarco I'd probably consider once again with the free transfer cushion. Mr. Yala, nice to see you my friend. Would you bench would you first bench Mukle Lefair Anderson? Uh definitely Lefay because the problem with defenders with bad games is they can always lose the negative points for conceding goals. Uh membership was over. Do you think as much anise uh hall to Timber and Bumo to Sar now? Yeah, I think this makes sense. I think this makes sense just to get triple Arsenal. I can understand it. I don't really love selling but at the end of the day you're getting triple Arsenal and you're getting Sar who's also a fantastic pick in FPL. Um Start Hall Nuno from Joan Glory. Um 8 minutes left by the way in the deadline. So thank you guys so much for being here. I'm going to refresh my team very quickly just to make sure that my team's actually good to go. Um, also looking out for one of your mesh uh your questions, Jon Miller. Um, if you're going to drop that anytime soon. I also have to share my team on the deadline so that I don't get criticized for not sharing my Twitter team ahead of the deadline. Um, so let's just make sure we do that as well. Um, all right. So, um, start hall or Nunes. You've got Ektull bench currently. I would, but Elf and Anderson starting. I would bench L for Ekdk for sure. Um, I would also play Nunes over Hall. I think that's quite simple. Um, TV locked. What does that mean? Sorry. Triple captain. Triple captain's locked for me. Uh, he has Crab Califury. He can't afford Timber. I would probably still go Cibba to be honest. It's a bit safer. But, you know, Califury, I guess, like if you plan on selling that player in a few weeks time, I guess I'd probably go Cal Fury. Uh, Discord DM quickly. I could probably have a look. Yep. Um, nice to see you around that guy. It said points versus principles. Let's have a look at your Discord DM. Um, it's Rice, right? Yeah, just go for Rice. I I really don't mind going for Rice. I don't think Rice is, for example, like a worse pick than Gabrielle, to be honest, even outright. It's just that the reason why I didn't go for Rice is because fine for the double. I think Rice is similar to Gabrielle, but actually um I don't really like Rice coming out of the double game. I'd rather have a midfield with players like Palmer, etc. Or at least move Palmer to Wartz and so um Vert. Uh so yeah, that's kind of why I went for Palmer as opposed to going for Rice last week. So yeah, I think Rice is actually a really good bet against the field. In a way, you're you're basically kind of saying I already own, you know, less Arsenal defense than the rest. I'm praying for Arsenal defenses to not happen. And it's not the worst punt in the world. Like I guess directionally speaking, Arsenal getting two clean sheets or even zero clean sheets is kind of like a similar probability. Um the one clean sheet probability is like 70%. But yeah, I mean like it can still flip, you know, in terms of a zero or a one or a two and in the circumstance that we do land on zero then then you're absolutely laughing and it's a huge bet against the field. But I do like it. Um start Muk or Lefay Lefay just because as a midfielder you're you're you're a bit more insulated from the enemy team scoring lots more goals against you. As good as Sunderlandar, I still quite I still quite like Lefay. Uh, love your videos, Fran. Keep up the good work. Good question. Which FPL player do you swear you'll never own again, but always end up buying back? Thank you so much for the question, Arthur Suda. Um, I think that I I guess it's a player that keeps on hurting me in terms of like owning him recently. I I guess it's Bukayo Saka, right? I I I I've hated owning him this season if I'm being completely honest. Um, but I think the logic for owning him in most circumstances where I've owned him was there technically quote unquote probably wrong. Uh, but yeah, Aaron Sweetman, uh, 3569. Hi, Fran. Which two to start? VVD, Thiago, Krooppy Jr., uh, definitely Virto Van Djk. And then I think I would just go with Thiago to be honest. I think penalties and minutes are just more important than what Krooppy has. And, you know, also a pretty poor game. Um, I do like Krooppy's chances, but I still prefer Sessie over him. Quick questions. Will try my best. Uh, please answer my super chat. Absolutely. We're trying to not miss super chats. Uh sorry, Hosny. Uh Osni Riskala. Hopefully that's um how you said. Are you not afraid of a double gaming 36 for City? I mean there's nothing to be afraid of, right? So I mean there are multiple weeks where I go go against a Holland captaincy. A gaming 36 can definitely happen for Man City, but I I don't think for example, for whatever reason, like Gabrielle's a much worse triple captain than Holland. And there's honestly a pretty decent chance that still the the the double gaming 36 for City doesn't actually land. Um so I'm not afraid. I think in FPL you kind of understand, okay, you have a positive advantage this week cuz you're playing a chip, but of course you know there at some point in time other people are going to use the chip against you and and and you're going to have a poor week. Like you can't stop that in FPL. Just like for example this week people might be scared of the triple captaincy on Gabrielle, but then suddenly they might advantage themselves later with another good triple captaincy later down the season. So from, you know, it is just, you know, you give and take with this game really. Um, FPLDB8, thank you so much for your super chat. Bench boost Dravka, Munos, KDH, and Tulu. Um, I would bench boost. Yeah, I think that's a strong bench boost. Uh, which Arsenal defense should I get if I can't afford Timber? Um, I would probably prioritize um, Cal Fury. Um, well, no, I'd go Cibba, I think, for safety, but then Califury I still quite like. So, it's probably that's the kind of order that that I would go with. Um, Anish, I think you mentioned that your squad's on X. Um, my thoughts on your team is that honestly, that's a fantastic team. How are you benching Chaloba? I I would play Chaloba 100% over Krooppy Jr. That's the only thing that I would say. Um, I think the rest of the team is pretty good though. I think you're you're good to go. So, best of luck for you this week. Play Keller Dravka. I'd probably play Dravka still this week. Like, I mean, Kyle Fury is nice, but we and we can say his attacking ceiling is high, but if he if he's going to sort of play 65ish minutes, like it's it's not like there's there's like amazing opportunities as well, right? Um because that sort of takes you out of a lot of the bonus equations for most of the games. Um, Dravk or Verbbrugen? I think I'd play D. I'd probably play Verbugen still to be honest. Would you rather Wilson to Zubie Mendy though or Hall to Timber? Um, Wilson to Zubie Mendy is not awful. [snorts] Yeah, I actually don't mind the Zubie Mendy play here. But, you know, coming out of the double like doesn't Wilson actually just have some generally good fixtures? Like if we look at the Fulham fixtures, I guess coming out of these two fixtures, this is a good schedule like right. So, keeping Wilson for Tottenham at home, West Ham away. So, West Ham at home, Ning Force away, Burnley at home, I think actually is valuable. So, I don't really mind the SR move that you kind of have in your mind. Um, lock in deadline one minute away. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Um, okay. So, thank you so much, Dar, for the questions. Minus four to bring in Timber this week, so you're out. Yeah, I I like those moves as well. Um, play Krooppy or Muki? I play Krooppy over Muki. I mean, that's kind of my my bench. Well, I sold Muki, so it's a bit different, but I would play Krooppy. um over him. I'm going to quickly post my team on Twitter as well. It's time to lock in moves, guys. I'll be honest here. Hi, friend. Two things I'm not sure about. TC Rice versus Gabrielle. I You've got to lock in. I I think Gabrielle is a bit safer if I'm being honest. Like I maybe it's the position that I'm in the world. So I I quite like Gabrielle. Um good luck with L. Thank you my friend. This is a pretty hectic dead. I'm not going to lie. Coming back from work. Um but yeah, we'll be going back to work shortly. Um Gui or DCL? I would have played uh Gui for sure. Um someone went with Rice. I like that. All right, let me just double check my, you know, I think I've already double checked my team, right, the deadline has passed. Um, Hill long-term, I think, is a solid pick. It seems like Andreola absolutely loves him. Um, thanks Fran, you're the goat. Thank you. And on Z taka makes sense. Evening Fran, do we know who doubles in 33? Not yet. No, I mean, we have a vague understanding of it, but and nothing's confirmed. You'll get a better understanding after FA Cup and stuff like that. Um, you did wild card in 24 and got SA and money for this week. Do you see Saw Mani? Sessi Aleti is a good bench booster. Just wait for 33. Sorry, I did miss that question. Deon Mansour, but um I mean I would have just played Saw and Mani this week. I don't think Sessi Aleti is a good bench booster at all. Um like if you can bench I think that's fine. Did I triple cap? Yes, I did my friend. Love you Fran. Thank you so much. Thank you Basil. Uh Oreie Jr. KDH. I would have played O'Reilly but it's a bit too late. It is deadline everyone so down and all that stuff. But thank you guys so much for joining the stream once again. and do subscribe if you've enjoyed the content and I'll see you guys for more. Um yeah, I actually forgot to update my rank um for the stream. So yeah, not that it really matters because it'll change again very very shortly. Um but yeah, I did triple captain. Um have a good week everyone. Start Somerville or Thiago? I would have probably started Somerville if I'm honest. He's just been like absolutely nuclear hot and honestly a home game like you you can't say it's awful. Uh what are my plans for Palmer 28 onwards? Definitely just to sell him to Florian words or maybe like another Brenford bit if for whatever reason or maybe even it's even I actually forgot to crop my team properly in in the uh FPL screenshot. So, that was silly. Hopefully, we can just fix that shortly. Cool. Um, how are we doing, chat? I bet we bowl. I'm selling BBD to an Arsenal defender and I'm playing planning to do Enzo to Dango and Rice to Vort and give me 28 but if I go for Timber I'll be left with 0.0 in the bank and I'm currently on transfer. Uh have you not made moves already my friend or am I a bit confused cuz you're going for an Arsenal defender now or you're just telling me that you've made this move and therefore you need to do Enzo Tango. Yeah, I think that makes sense. I mean to be honest like if you actually had that cushion you probably needed to go for another um Arsenal player. Is the hair am I getting a haircut this week? I don't think I need a haircut now. Um I probably need to shave because obviously I look terrible, but yeah. Um I'm finally doing well in this game. Top 250, mate. That's insane. Well done. Um couple of you guys in the chat just doing absolutely crazy. Um sprinkle some of your luck on me this week. Yeah, I I hope everyone gets lucky, but the reality is some of us are terrible luck, right? And um yeah, I I I certainly felt that last season. 1,700 lovely Bobby. Um sorry for the confusion with with the chats. Look, to be honest, I think one of the tricky things when I'm hopping on a deadline stream is there's absolutely no way I can interact on multiple platforms at once, especially when the chat's kind of um doing well. Apparently, the J Pedro news. No, I don't think so. I got tricked by, you know, like when someone retweets like a post that's like from a different time in space. Um, yeah, like I saw I saw some sort of post which was like, \"Oh, Gabrielle's not in the squad.\" But it was like from 2024 and I had a small panic attack. [laughter] Ah, great. Yeah, I did Gabriel and TC. That's correct. You're 2K in the world. Thanks for my help. Thank you so much, Dave Rice. I'm happy for you. We have good coach. It's fake news. Yeah, it's it it does look like fake news. Even the fake news on Job Pedro looks fake. Yeah, for some reason the largest super chat has not worked for me to put the whole squad. Oh, right. Yeah, cuz you used to you used to just send me your squad. Same same with Salem as well. So, I don't know what's happened there. uh like the stream guys. Yeah, absolutely. Please do. Thank you guys so much. But yeah, thank you guys honestly so much for the support. Um it was a quick 30 minute stream, but I really appreciate you guys for coming in and and supporting and I I wish we have the best game week. Lots of football to watch which I'm going to enjoy. Um but yeah, I'll see you guys soon and um yeah, take care guys. Um have a good weekend as well, you know, cuz we won't be doing content I guess around the weekend. I won't see you guys for a live stream. Um but yeah, we we'll see you shortly. I also thought it was 6:30 if I'm being completely honest. I I came home with 30 minutes to spare. Um so yeah, later chat. Kala scoring a banger. I like the sound of that. All right, take care all. I'll see you guys soon."

      "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome back to FPL Fran. Today's video is going to be my gaming 26 cheat sheet. If you've never seen the cheat sheet series before, it's effectively a tier list in FPL of all sorts of players based on their price point and positions, looking at how great they are for the immediate run ahead, taking into account more than the three fixtures as you see on the screen, but rather even the next five, six fixtures. Although from a fixture point of view, I also want to mention that a lot of people are loosely planning a wild card 32. That's the most conventional strategy at this moment in time. That's simply because people are planning to dead end in gaming 31 where we have a blank gameweek. So whilst we have a double gameweek this week in game 26 which is exciting. We've got Arsenal and Wolves doubling um those teams will blank in game 31 and so will likely Obsidian and Crystal Palace in game 312 as long as City continue to progress within the FA Cup. Now, from a fixture point of view, I think there's some pretty interesting transfers that people can make, but it all comes down to, you know, what's the luxury for you or not and whether you're able to kind of make those moves. As far as the cheat sheet, I think we've had some pretty radical changes more so within the cheap price points of players because simply put, there's a lot of diversity right now across I think specifically the midfield, but also the defender position. So, let's jump into the cheat sheet. A lot of the stats here are all provided by Opta stats with the fantasy football hub tool. Um, you'll need to access premium for that, but you can find it in the link in description below. Probably one of the best tools in terms of all-in-one stats for FPL, which include some of the defcon stats as well, and a lot of other stats, too, that are very helpful in terms of assessing things like if you want to look at per start or, you know, the average minutes of a player, that sort of thing. So, let's have a look at the midfielders. As I said, I did want to sort of drop Douglas Luis down a bit cuz I think I I noticed a bit of an earlier substitution within the previous game versus Bournemouth, but I'm I'm kind of hesitating on that. So, I still think for the price point, for someone who should be close to touching defcon per game, has tools in his pocket like set pieces and and penalties, I think he's still a really good pick just because the villa runs so good. Dbury Hall, we actually gave him a rise a couple weeks back just because of course he's back to playing and I have liked the positions that he's taking up. He is just one of those players like Harry Wilson this season in a sense who has gotten lots of holes. Bruno is quite similar. We are moving into a league almost where the more interesting I guess box-to-box players are doing exceptionally well because they also have you know the additionals piece for the potential assist and and and of course circumstances where you actually find them being quite good in open play this season where ultimately they can get that sort of upper ceiling of a hole. Um he also is utilized in different sorts of positions depending on let's say the specific tactics of this Everton team. Sometimes even more advanced than usual but yeah Dubbury Hall is just a very exceptional player. As far as Lefay you know people might might see him as deserving of a drop but I think coming out of the Arsenal game he's just on a generally decent fixture run post Liverpool. Uh and this is I suppose a slightly weakened Liverpool as well. And you know keep in mind of course the context is that Sunderland have been really good this season at home. So I think he's still a really solid solid pick. As far as the next tier though, that's where a lot of people are I think starting to move that they're sort of fifth midfielder too just because if you can kind of afford to own someone in one of these price spots, I think you're you're doing good. Not that Duce Hall or Douglas are a massive difference. But it's just if you can stretch towards let's say an Anderson right now, I think he's still probably the most solid pick within all the midfield position just because the baseline for the Defcon's so strong and he still is a setpiece taker. So, I can understand why people think he's a boring pick and I don't own him, for example, but I think the value towards Anderson is is ascribed to actually not just the idea that he can get that four point or seven point game, but also I still think he has that ceiling of, you know, stretching towards 10 points, something like, you know, for example, getting an assist from a set piece and then some of the defcon actions and and and then bonus sliced in as we've seen before. So, that helps. I think that there's not much of a focal point in terms of the attack of the team and there are circumstances where let's say when nodding force is doing good that Anderson will prevail as a really good pick from a bonus perspective too. Somerville I we actually gave him an introduction to the cheat sheet actually to the top tier last week. Uh it's good that he's kind of renewed I suppose the confidence around him. This is a player of course who is in extremely hot form. Four goals in four games and I don't see much signs signs of him stopping to be honest. the underlying stats have ticked up massively since Nuno's new Nuno has come into the team and yes of course he's overperforming a fair bit and and I think we can definitely acknowledge that um but he still is clearly a player that it's hard to judge because I still think this is is someone who's probably quite prone to circumstance hasn't had that many Premier League minutes anyways and so the context is that we can probably be a little bit less judgmental about the underlying stats as far as Casemiro and and Garner I've given both of them rises. Garner I probably spoke too soon in terms of maybe his defcon numbers dropping after Dbury Hall, you know, reinserted himself back into the team and Gay as well. He's just been exceptional in Defcon and he still takes a fair few set pieces. So I still think probably I I overstep the mark a little bit in terms of dropping him. He's just been very very strong and I think every week I seem to see that the Sebrit numbers or the defcon numbers of course are going up and up and up. For Pascal Gross, I've actually given him a drop. But going back to Casemiro, this is more a case of once again, I think team strengths sometimes do dictate certain things within the cheat sheet. So if I think unfortunately I I'm not valuating, let's say, the the Brighton team very well and equally if I'm starting to rate the United team a lot more, that's, you know, an incremental shift that I'll take into account for all the players. But I think Casemiro clearly is just playing exceptionally well. I wouldn't say his defcon numbers are are, you know, completely out of the box, but he's a huge setpiece threat as well. And you can kind of look at the NPXG per 90 as a good reflection of that. I mean, he's just proven to be a very efficacious player this season and a key target for the set pieces, right? So, yes, of course, I've, for example, bought Maguire for set pieces. Felt like watching the Tottenham game that actually all of them went towards Casemiro apart from, let's say, the themo goal. But, yeah, I mean, he's just, you know, in a great moment. And I think with Ugarte still seemingly rather unplayable, that's the bonus. I I was quite concerned about giving Casemiro a significant rise last week just because I was a bit concerned about whether Ugarante would, you know, come in a little bit more at 75 minutes, 80 minutes. But I still think that where possible, Casemiro is going to be sort of I would say run into the ground a little bit just because the level of performance and the gap between him and Guarte is is gigantic. Uh with Gross, as I said, that's more of a team strength thing. I also think it's unlikely that he's going to be that much of a dominating sort of defcon force. I think he's a bit more of a controller in the game, but I don't think he's going to be, you know, an allaction type player in the sense that he's going to get a lot of ball recoveries. So, probably overstep the mark a little bit on him. So, he does get the drop. In other tiers, not too many differences. I would say in the midfield position, I feel pretty comfortable with how I've placed a lot of the players within the 6 million price bracket. Sure, of course, players like Nai and Ahmad have not been delivering recently, but Ahmad, I think, still has very much satisfied the eye test. Nai has been a little bit dull. I have to be completely honest. I do think part of that is maybe this Everton team are still, you know, struggling from an attacking perspective with the lack of depth that they have. Um, and he is kind of defended as if he was the focal point of the team in open play. But yeah, I mean, I still think that things like penalties are are still very valuable. So, the cost of NI is is is very much worth it. Although you can make the argument that a Garner or a Dooberry Hall have really just been doing better and that's kind of the state of FPL at times where you have these options at at a 5 million 5.5 million price point who are still all capable of getting some super holes in the 6.1 sort of yellow tier. I've given Barnes, you know, no changes. I do think he kind of deserves to get a rise, but I do think just the next two games aren't ideal. So, I would say Barnes is someone who you'd probably benefit from if this Gordon injuries extended. Now, House quote seems to suggest that Gordon will be coming back soon. So, I just think that I can't really afford to give Barnes a higher rise despite the minutes looking pretty good with the Gordon absence at this moment in time. With Wilson, it's more a case of I think waiting for Gaming 28 to kind of look at him as an option in with Sabo. He's obviously suspended for Gaming 26, but I don't think that's a huge issue. He only is suspended for gaming 26 because it's Dogso. denial of a goal scoring opportunity. It was not violent conduct. So he will be back very quickly for gaming 27 and I think 28 onwards is where Liverpool's run just looks very beautiful. So no real reason to to say that he is someone that is an immediate cell at this moment in time. Whereas I think for example with someone like Turkey, you're starting to see Marmush push into getting more leftwing minutes and I think that's a problem for him. But I will also say that City seemed to once again from an attacking point of view open themselves a little bit more towards this Liverpool team when Turkey was on the pitch. So I don't think Jerky is someone who's, you know, a bit of a bust in terms of FPL. He just has such an electric ceiling as long as he has good minutes. He's always probably going to be on the cheat sheet because it's not like he's on the complete peripheries like someone like Foddin where even for example Nico Riley is, you know, taking precious minutes away from other midfielders within this Man City team alongside Bernardo Silva who clearly is Pep's favorite in that 7 million tier. I wouldn't make too many changes other than I've actually added Bruno G back into the cheat sheet. The issue with Brunoji obviously was always around this injury piece. The the big thing whilst Gordon is out is that he's on on penalties which is obviously massive and he did take advantage of that already within the Premier League this season and did it again within the previous game week. I would say that as a set piece taker he is is quite similar to a lot of those sort of 5 million 6 million players but you also kind of have to give credit to what he's done this season. I think some of the open play numbers are actually pretty heartening. But do I think he's a little bit overpriced? possibly, which is why I'm only comfortable sort of putting him in that yellow tier for now. But I think people can make the same criticism about someone like Rogers, who I would probably just make the counterpoint just simply as a much cleaner fixture run, you know, from my perspective. As far as let's say that next tier, there is some uncertainty around Embeo, but I'm not really going to move around EBMO and WZ until Doru comes back. I think Kuna's minutes are perfectly safe. It also helps that Cesco and his performances still look extremely lackluster. And in in that sort of top tier, Bruno's so close to a price point, I've actually just bucketed him with the Palmer and Asala for now. And I'm happy to keep him there. What I would probably say is that Palmer is maybe in very cir certain circumstances an interesting transfer, but more of a luxury transfer. I don't really see him, despite having two amazing fixtures back to back, as being a green tier pick because I do think he is very situational for managers. I actually went to Palmer simply because as you guys know I've I've sort of been funneling as much money as possible towards my midfield and as the circumstance of that I had a very cheap defense which allowed me to go for Palmer but also have the flexibility to go towards triple Arsenal on a week like this and gave me 26. So that's a very sort of certain circumstance. I don't think a lot of people should be suddenly reorganizing their team so that they can get Palmer into their squad. Moving on towards the forwards here. Not too many changes. Once again, I've actually given some drops towards players that I just think aren't really performing up to scratch. Evan Nilson have given a soft drop to. I think yes, of course, he's still in the midst of what is a relatively good fixture run, but I'm I'm not really sure he's on penalties. I also think the quality fixtures isn't like, you know, a leads and a Burnley back to back like a Jao Pedro. Neither is he as solid and rotatable as a Thiago for example who just in my opinion with with guaranteed penalty share with guaranteed minutes all the time is always going to be a better option than him. So I'm giving Evan Nilson a bit of a soft drop here. Bowen as well this could be harsh but some of West Ham's fixtures have also come and gone. So really I think the next two games are actually really good United games but then after that there's more than enough reason to start shifting someone like Bowen out of your team. I also kind of wanted to acknowledge Salanki and Hertz who are both probably going to be interesting differential options going forwards. Havitz is someone who definitely benefits from being able to be positionally quite flexible and as Odigard continues to be out. I think he benefits in hisstead. With Senanki, we're starting to see sort of a reaccumulation of minutes and I think it's unfair to sort of judge Salanki on the underlying so far within the Premier League. But I will say the numbers for Tottenham's attack or any autonomous attacker this season has been extremely bleak. So, it's not like I have a lot of confidence in in, you know, any sort of way with Salanki despite him, for example, having things like penalties and what will more than likely be better minutes as we go on and he continues to build up his fitness. I've added Stan Larson within the cheaper tiers, just, you know, shifting gears back to that. I think ultimately Tran Larson is is a very strong pick and of course the next two games because the pals look really good, especially with the likely, I think, conclusion that Mateta is going to be unfit and probably going to opt for a surgical route. At the time of recording this video, I haven't actually looked into the news of this, but I think we were kind of expecting at least by the game um 26 deadline to get some news on whe whether Mata is going to get surgery and I think that does help with the Strand Larson case. I do unfortunately actually think that Sar takes penalties and I think that takes away from some of the value of Shan Larson. He actually had a great chance versus Brighton. So that should be positive signs as you head into two of the easiest fixtures of the season including sort of a revisiting of his old team in Wolves. But yeah, I like Shan Larson, but honestly, not that much because you also have to factor in that later down the line, Shan Larson will be worth a transfer, and that's that's kind of not ideal. I think something to mention in terms of some players to actually think about this week as transfers in would be some of the cheaper players, but this is really really for the maximum luxury case. players who kind of have the opportunity to use maybe when they're at that three to four transfer stage of going for a completely luxury transfer. So I would be thinking about things like if you've got a Marku in your team, a Cheeto Obi in your team, if you wanted to move towards a mane or a tool, I think this could make sense for example for this Wolves game, but you are really almost using a transfer exclusively for this week. And I suppose at at the very sort of best case scenario, this is a player who's much more usable than Q as bench depth. So something to consider for managers here. Tulu is more of a nine option. He clearly will have better numbers going forwards as as it comes to for example things like bookies odds and and and how he gets predicted to to score goals. But Manis on set pieces his chances of getting bonus are I think in my opinion maybe not as high because Tulu was still the the main goal threat of the team. But I I just think that he is almost an all action player. I like the fact that he's on set pieces and ultimately too he's just a lot cheaper. So he shouldn't really hamper any kind of ability to to build on your squad going forwards. As far as that sort of final few tiers of expensive players in my opinion, Holland is still at a point where because the options like Salah are still not really performing towards the level that we would really like and alternative options like Palmer still have really shaky minutes and Bruno is actually relatively cheap in the grand scheme of things. I think that has all helped to keep Holland at the spot that he's at. EkitK I've actually given a soft drop to. I can see a lot of people in two weeks time actually thinking Ekit TK is going to be a perfect buy and give me 28. I'm actually looking you know as a manager myself of thinking that I will probably go for holding EKTK in my position. But I also feel that it's fair to actually give him a soft drop here because simply put he can be sold. there are better players at the midfield position at the same price point of EKTK and that's almost how the decision kind of gets crunched where at that sort of position of let's say a Thiago or Jao Pedro I still think they're more than justifiable and you're still shopping for the most part I think for having at least a second striker I can see some people who've actually increasingly moved into let's say having a third striker in their teams and maybe that's going to be the meta shift in a few weeks time because if you don't own let's say a Cole Palmer you absolutely have no reason really to be spending this much money in the game. Um, in let's say going a 352 formation, you have enough money to actually probably spread the funds and instead of going for a 343, you can basically have a 353, if that makes sense, where for most weeks I would say you have a cheaper defense, but then actually you can just choose to play 352 versus 343 flexibly. Um, whereas some people right now are almost exclusively kind of, I think, pinching that mid mid midfield spot into someone who's cheap and probably a little bit useless. And in the forward position actually we've always had depth options like creepy Junior and Mane where yes maybe there is an opportunity to just keep these players because they're actually very solid or to just move into you know a double 7 million mid who I think also works quite well from a kind of template point of view moving towards these fender positions. This is once again another position where I feel like we got we made a lot of changes last week instead and I feel very comfortable with where I've situated a lot of players. So where I have players from United I feel pretty comfortable with them. The drop down for the Sunderland players I think was fair but they're still very strong. Leads once again options are getting Defcon. Although Stra I just want to mention seems to have something wrong with his hip flexor. So he's likely to miss out this this upcoming game. Otherwise we have options like for example the opportunity to reassess Brenford very very shortly. So we have had Collins bench for a couple games. So you can see in the 5 million plus tier that he actually has dropped but I have not for example conversely given let's say and Vandenberg a rise. I think the the point here is that you can just wait for the Arsenal game to kind of allow yourself to reassess what is going on exactly with this Brenford team. But keep in mind of course with Keith Andrews I think if I could probably say something for him this season. It does seem like he's very comfortable just simply shifting on his center backs. Um we went from basically Vandenberg versus Collins for the large parts of the season to Vandenberg having a very soft injury and then actually getting immediately displaced by Ayier for a couple weeks and then the same thing happened with Ayair where Vandenberg came onto the pitch and suddenly he starts the Knicks game with Ayair and Vandenberg. So it seems like maybe Collins has an issue but I don't think we've seen much reported on it. However, I will also say that I watched I think Brenford versus Nottingham Forest and and Eigor Jesus did seem to have a pretty easy chance at scoring a goal when he scored his pretty good sort of half volley shot versus Collins. I I do wonder if Keith Andrews is a bit temperamental. I can't really criticize him because he's had just an exceptional Premier League season for a firsttime Premier League manager. So, there's really not much to say. He's completely bossing the league. He knows better than me. But something to think about in terms of can you get a cheaper brand for defender or you know does Collins even have any utility going forward. So hard to say in those kind of higher price points at the 5 million tier. I've given Califur a rise. I do think he'll play both games in the double. I could be wrong but I just think that he does add a little bit more on the kind of attacking element of things compared towards a hingapier. I think Arteta's option or you know chance to let's say play Cal Fury for two 60-minute games is right there. The FA Cup being sandwiched in between the double also means that most likely he's going to be rested for the right fixtures and to to be playing and starting for the good ones. At his price point with the gap that he has over let's say a Timber and a Gabrielle, I think it's more than justified to actually consider a colory if that 0.8 million or arguably that 1.7 million can be a huge difference in terms of squad construction in the future. Would I consider him as a captaincy option? Not necessarily. But I think he's a very solid pick if you're kind of looking for someone who actually, you know, fills your team out for the double and then actually can be a really solid option for yourself going forwards. Lacra also gets a rise. This is mostly just Palace related. Um I would have loved to, let's say, give, you know, Richards and Munos massive rises and kind of think that they're the best picks in the game. I I think it's as simple as Burnley and Wolves at home is that good. So this is why the Palace players are going up. I think very very shortly you'll see that they'll also go down. But this is just what happens in a game where in reality like just like Chelsea's next two games, you have two perfect fixtures and you really want to take advantage of that as much as you can. I can't necessarily have the luxury of going for Munos, but I congratulate any manager who's got the opportunity to do so and wish them the best of luck. As far as Cho, I've given him a bit of a soft drop. I still really like Hall's numbers. Chaw clearly has been a really good setpiece throughout the season as well and his def numbers are good but I don't think they're that exceptional and in in my opinion too I I don't think Newcastle are massively you know far behind let's say a team like Liverpool or City in terms of the defensive quality but some of the recent performances are still a little bit more alarming and I I'm not 100% certain that I love Newcastle's fixture run anyways which is why I've given to a drop because I think a lot of people maybe will be facing with the decisions of actually selling one of the two players if they own two Newcastle defenders and the player that I definitely would want to keep is is someone like Hall. Not to mention that in gaming 31 actually when you know we roll around towards that blank game weekend and it's actually quite soon that Newcastle defenders will be a very good option to kind of own for that sort of dead end fixture. So that's kind of it for the defenders as well. And then in terms of the goalkeepers, we've added Jose Sa just because he's a differential option just for the purposes of this double game week. I I don't really love the Jos move unless once again you're in this position where you already own triple Arsenal. you don't own Rya and suddenly you do want to have a goalkeeper here for the double. That could be interesting. But keep in mind, of course, one of these goalkeepers does play versus Arsenal. So, it's not ideal, but I can see the the value of it if you just have, as I said, somewhere between three to five transfers, and it actually could be really worthwhile. Henderson gets a a small little rise for me, once again, fixture related, and Rose gets a bit of a drop just because of fixtures, too. So when you kind of look at the teams as I said in this Premier League season after for example Newcastle, Liverpool and City, the quality and defense once again is a huge drop. And of course these teams are are massively separated against a team like Arsenal who are far far clear of the rest of the field. But between let's say I guess the defensive quality of maybe I don't know maybe a team like let's say Tottenham or Palace who are quite close to Liverpool, Newcastle, there is a massive gulf in terms of XGC with the rest but they're all bunched up in the middle of the table. So, I think there's not too much really separating a lot of the teams. It's mostly the fixtures at any point in time. And with goalkeepers, they're a little bit more fixture proof just because you'll be holding for much longer fixture runs. So, that's just something to mention. But, we're in a pretty good stable spot within the game. And that's going to be it for the cheat sheet. So, thank you guys so much for watching. See you guys soon and best of luck with this double gaming 26. Let me know if you're planning to do a triple captaincy on Gabrielle cuz I'd be quite interested to see what your thoughts are. Otherwise, as I said, take care and goodbye. And do subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and you're enjoying the content."

      "transcript": "Hey everyone, welcome back to FPL Fran. Today's video is going to be my gameweek 26 team selection. I'm also going to put the transfer plans in this video. So for all the kind of viewers who like to see, for example, what my plans are for gaming 27, 28, and beyond and how I plan to get to my wild card 32, we'll discuss that very, very quickly. So the positive I think from from this week's games is that you already know the doubles. And so for a lot of people, I think it's just either getting your triple arsenal this week if you, let's say, skipped that decision-m last week or actually probably rolling or maybe even being a little bit more aggressive and pursuing something like a Wolves move. Now, I think because of the Sobo suspension and unfortunately, of course, me having to use the transfer on Saka, I am a little bit delayed in terms of how I've approached this double game week. So, I will be using my one free transfer this week trying to get an Arsenal player, but I mean just quickly reviewing game 25. It was an exceptional game week 85 points which was massive. Uh mostly thanks to Cole Palmer. The captaincy went wrong I guess technically in hindsight by one point. That doesn't really matter too much. So got a red card. The only impact there of course is the four points lost and then him being suspended for one week. And that's one week because it's a denial of a goalc scoring opportunity as opposed to violent conduct. Maguire finally got us some points in FPL. Uh that's worthwhile. So nice to get a clean sheet there. But I will admit that James Hill is absolutely cooking. So anyone who's actually gotten James Hill as their sort of low effective ownership defender, congratulations to you. You're winning so far. I hope to come back with Maguire, but of course I'm kind of also anxiously waiting for Deick to hopefully not come back into the team so that I can keep Magguire for a while longer. As far as Anderson, yeah, bit of a flop this week, especially since Richards did well, but I can't complain. This was a really, really good gameweek. I wanted to play most of the players I wanted to play. I put a lot of value in terms of Krooppy Junior as a player, and he actually had really good opportunities within the match versus Villa. So, I don't feel too bad about, let's say, benching Richards. That's not really a decision that I'm going to revisit too hard. But, I do look forward to playing Richards when he has amazing fixtures the next two games and and seeing what happens and unfolds there with Rya. Nice to know that he can actually get seven points. That might be the new ceiling for Rya and hopefully he can supersede that in the double game week in 26. But that's kind of how I feel about the team. Let's just jump into the team selection for this game week. So, shifting gears towards the team selection. I wanted to use the 11ifi numbers for this week. So, you can find him on 11ifi.com. An excellent FPL manager as well. I believe he's back in the top 10 or top 20,000 in the world in terms of overall rankings. So, yeah. I mean, you can trust this guy's stuff. As far as this week, though, I mean, it's clearly a double game week with Arsenal, so there there's not really much to be said in terms of like opportunities. Clearly, you want to maximize on Arsenal. For Wolves, I think there's some value in maybe potentially going for one of their attackers. Like if you have luxury free transfers, I think the value here is that just with the appearance points alone and maybe just having a decent opportunity versus not forest that you can get some value there from maybe moving into a mane or even a a tool, especially with Shan Larson gone, you can guarantee to's minutes. You can probably guarantee a bit of pen share as well. Mani's on set pieces uh on the flip side of that and of course has slightly worse underlying stats simply because he's a bit more of a deepline player. Not that he's really a deep line player, but more just in the sense that he's a midfielder, right? So, I've seen him, of course, as the last man operating for this Wolves team at times, but to generally speaking, will be in better spots in terms of just being inside the box and being able to take and accumulate xG. Otherwise, this is a really good city game. So, I think for a lot of people who have somehow held more than one city player, and that player being Holland, if you have a Semeno or even an Oria or even a Nunes, for example, I think these players have a lot of tremendous value this week. So, this is a good time to just keep those players as long as you think they're still in the pecking order. So, I'm not talking about players like Fodin or even arguably Cherokee who's a little bit off and on cuz I I do think that Churkey coming onto the pitch was a big massive game changer for City. Um, but yeah, I mean, Marmush is around the corner and you can see even him starting on the left for City has impacts going forwards in terms of how we evaluate Cherokee's minutes and that will impact for example my cheat sheet. Elsewhere though, this is a really good Chelsea game. They did get smashed by leads last time when they were actually playing away from home. I do think that was a particularly rotated Chelsea team. So, and of course, we have a new manager here. I think the jury is still out in terms of, you know, whether Renior is going to improve this squad a lot. And I'd like to see, of course, whether Chelsea will improve as an attack and maybe whether you know the baseline's changed. for example, are they trading what was I think quite a solid defense in the past maybe under Moresca which wasn't the great I think when he was around the time when he actually chose to kind of leave and part ways with Chelsea I think Chelsea were probably around mid table in terms of XGC that's gone a little bit further south now but I do wonder if the attack is a bit better you do hear players talking about how they're allowed to play more freely and I I just wonder of course if the dividends just mean that Chelsea attack is much better Chelsea's defense is a bit worse at the same time the more chaotic they seem to someone like Chalawa still seems to be benefiting every single game by getting Defcon. Elsewhere though, I I do want to just say you kind of got very both teams to score type games in terms of Villa versus Brighton, Everton versus Bournemouth. So, the expected goals for those games aren't particularly high. I wouldn't say clean sheets are great either because they're just simply better, more one-sided fixtures across the board, right? That could be Liverpool as an example. um even a forest if somehow you own forest players which is unlikely but more specifically I think Crystal Palace is is the team to sort of mention here especially since Crystal Palace do have a blank game week in 31 or are very likely to have a blank game week in 31 that's actually predicated on on City advancing in the FA Cup but I I think right now you there is an opportunity for a lot of managers to actually punt in into Crystal Palace this week so players like Sar who I can't go into myself or even arguably players like maybe Lacra or amunos in terms of defense or a Richards if you want to go cheap. However, of course, the flip side of the coin is is is is that player is most likely going to be a transfer out as well. So, do think about that. If you, you know, don't have a wild card or do have a wild card, I think you still have to somehow circumvent that. And otherwise, this is a great United game still. It's it's West Ham who have been a pretty poor defense this season. I think they've shown that they've been able to score in most games. So, I think this is not a game where I'm expecting, for example, Meguire to do exceptionally well, but I think just given West Ham struggles with set pieces this season, I'm still going to hopefully think that I have some value for Meguire from that perspective. But yeah, I mean, West Ham have obviously established themselves as a bit of a better team as of late and and that's something to think about in terms of long-term consequences. Otherwise, I I think yeah, that's kind of FPL for now. A lot of Arsenal transfers will be made. Wolves transfers for the luxury. Crystal Pal transfers for the luxury as well. Alternatively, I think for most people who are rolling, the key thing here is just to watch Brenford, right? Brenford have just gotten a great result versus Newcastle, especially Dango as well, um, who was just exceptional in the Newcastle game and really just has been exceptional since he's come back from AFCON. I kind of mentioned coming off the bench when he substituted Dams Guard immediately and on his first game back, he had already accumulated something like one point, you know, more than one one NPXGI within within his first match. Um, another great game versus Newcastle as I mentioned. And yeah, I think going forwards he's just going to be almost an essential pick at his price point. But it just depends on whether people want to go there because you can still kind of go for the Brenford attack by way of a shade in when he gets unsuspended or or just simply going Thiago, but I think doubling up is something that's going to be on a lot of people's plans. I'm a bit behind in that curve because I've I've clearly not owned Thiago for a while now, but Dango is looming around the corner and he's probably going to be my gaming 27 transfer, all things being said. So that's kind of the the lay of the land in terms of this game week. Let's quickly jump into my team selection for gameweek 26 for the first double of the season. So the plan for me is to actually go triple Arsenal defense. I kind of considered going for Rice from Enzo Lefay, but I think the simple reality is I don't really want Rice after gaming 26. Do I want Arsenal defense after gaming 26? Yes, I do. So that's kind of the main consideration there. the the fact that there are players like Vertz with much better fixtures on the horizon after a sudden away. The fact that there's also amazing fixtures for Brenford and Dango is as cheap as he is and and Brenford are as good as a team as they have been this season from the attacking point of view just makes me really want to leave transfers for that. Or even if it's going to cost me like for example if I have to take hits because of injuries, I'd much rather change my midfield very very quickly as opposed to, you know, go into someone like Rice and then move him on. I I I just like the idea of leaving room for that potential transfer later. I I also have a little bit of a hamstrong defense in right now because I've got Richards, I've got Meguire, and I've got Muki. These are very cheap 4.5 players. Anderson isn't playable, and he gave me 26 because he's got City away. So, I think I'm going to part ways with Muki. So, yeah, Timber is going to come in. Gabrielle is going to be in the squad and we're going to play with Richards and Maguire as well. So, that's going to be a fourback. And there's not much to be said here. I think Richards has a great game, so there's no discussing here. But Magguire and and why I've started him is actually because I do plan on benching Krooppy Jr. versus Everton away. I think that's a pretty tough offensive fixture for most teams. And whilst Krooppy Jr. obviously I mean he can kind of score in any game, but it's very hard to guess when that happens. And I still think the best guess is still generally speaking if you play versus a worse opponent, it's probably going to be better dividends, right? So, for example, when I played him versus Wolves, that was kind of the general idea there. Villa, at least that game was at home. This Everton game is going to be away from home. So, I'm not really looking forward to playing groupy Junior. Maguire, as I said, for the set piece, Elemental Things, and him actually being able to get Defcon is quite helpful. Uh, one thing to sort of mention in terms of Meguire is that he actually was very close to getting Defcon in the Tottenham game, if you looked at how the game was going before the red card. So I think before the red card which was around I can't really remember right now at the top of my head but probably around what 25 30 minutes into the game um maybe 29 minutes actually I'm thinking about it now but when Magguire actually you know went sorry when Tottenham went down to 10 men was already at five defcon or six and so at that sort of rate of course he was doing very well I think it was far clear of any of the other center backs. So, I'm actually looking forward to, you know, on a normal circumstance like Magguire have being a two-prong threat in terms of Defcon sometimes and then set piece sometimes on top of the usual sort of expected clean sheets and and so far I think the United defensive numbers have been really good. Now, I will say of course playing versus 10 men versus Tottenham is not going to make the sample size look any worse. In fact, it's going to make it a lot look a lot better, but the preceding games under Carrick were really really good. So, so far I'm quite liking the Maguire pick. We'll see how it kind of falls in the next few weeks as long as as I said Delect is going to be out and and doesn't come back soon or maybe he he will take some time to get eased in which will mean that I can play Magguire for for more games in the midfield though shifting gears towards that. I'm going to do Enzo and Palmer versus Leads at home. It seems like Enzo stepped into a space in FPL or sorry not FPL but rather in the Premier League and and this Chelsea team where I think he's maybe a little bit less rotatable than than people thought. Sure. Of course, Renior coming in meant that Andre Santos minutes could have definitely improved and I think they clearly have. But the key thing too, I think, is Enzo's also become an extremely established player within the squad and his minutes have looked really, really good under a senior. So, I think he's going to be a really good pick. And in the worst case scenario in the world where maybe in a few weeks time I don't have enough free transfers to get into the Brenford or the Liverpool players that I you know unfortunately want to own but might not be able to own if there's you know more injuries more red cards and stuff like that then I I still think owning players like Enzo and even arguably Palmer to an extent are okay right despite the fixtures turning so abruptly after giving 27 versus Burnley at home. So the plan is to sell these players but for now let's enjoy them. I will be playing Enzo Lefay as well. Of course, the the unfortunate piece here is with with the SOBO suspension, I I do plan on playing Lefay. So, the question I suppose is between whether I play Lefay or someone like Krooppy Junior. To me, Lefay is more a chance of saying, \"Okay, I have a player who kind of is a jack of all trades, master of none, or like a mini so even. I don't think he's a world-class setpiece taker, but he does take set pieces. He does also amass defcon in some games. We saw him get a lot versus Burnley, but this is going to be such a different game versus Liverpool. I do also maybe question whether he's going to get as many recoveries as he got for example in the Burnley match where I think just the level of play was much lower. So therefore he was able to kind of dictate and dominate a lot more through the recoveries and so maybe it's the case where Lefay isn't the most exciting pick for Liverpool but I almost think that he kind of has a higher floor if I'm expecting things like Defcon etc. uh with Bruno. I mean, he's a main stay on the team. Unfortunately, not a captaincy option in double game week when he's got a single, but he's done good for us lately. And and as I said, I've I've been super happy that I brought him even going back to the Man City game where he actually had a pretty nice hole there. Um he's just served us really really well from an FPL perspective. And in the front line, we'll definitely be playing Ekit and Holland. So, this is going to be a 442. I haven't actually fielded four defense recently, and part of that is because I've gone much cheaper into defense. So that's kind of meant that I've I've been trying to get out three defenders every single week as opposed to sort of amassing enough defenders so I can play a five back or a fourback. But this is the type of week where I have to play a fourback because suspended. I am planning to also play Lefay as I said over maybe some of the other defenders like an Anderson this week or even a Krooppy Jr. But that is a 50/50 sort of decision. Let me know what you guys think in terms of Krooppy Jr. versus Enzo Lefay. Um, you could probably completely disagree with me and and maybe I'll have a think about this because I guess am I really here for the Defcon for someone who's not that reliable in Defcon? So, for example, if Enzo Lefay was actually Elliot Anderson, I would very comfortably have played Enzil Lefay over Krooppy Jr. But this is a bit tougher because I think Lefay is not nearly as consistent as an Elliot Anderson or even a James Garner. So, that that kind of makes the decision a bit tougher. Sunderland at home as well just have been so good this season where I think it kind of adds towards the value of actually saying okay I don't really mind playing Lefay just backing the idea that Sunderland have been just exceptional as I said at home as far as let's say you know decision-m this week would I take any hits so last week I kind of presented the idea of you know taking ahead for Timber so I guess if I was thinking fast forward into this week you know would I have made a move if let's say I already have Timber in my team and I've got that one free transfer arguably not so it's it's kind of a tricky thing. I think maybe the advantage would be I could actually roll the free transfer um as opposed to now where I clearly have to just make that same transfer, but you know, not for a hit. But I'm I'm okay with that decision and, you know, it is what it is. So that's where we're at right now from an FPL perspective. We're we're planning to use that free transfer and hoping that we won't, you know, be in too much trouble because I think there's some value and maybe for people, as I said, with luxury free transfers to go from someone like Sabo to Sar where he just has two amazing games. Bernie at home, Wolves at home. But I can't really do that or justify that, I would say, because okay, I can make that minus four, but suddenly later down the line, I'll have to repay that with a hit um or, you know, a transfer that I probably I'm not planning for at this moment in time. So, it's hard for me to go. I just personally plan on having Solo back in my team when Liverpool's fixer on is anyways generally really really good from gaming 27 onwards and then I can just bring in the Brenford players that I want to have um slowly over 27 or even gaming 28 especially since for gaming 28 that's the week where I'm probably going to bin off most of my Chelsea players. So the way it's kind of going to work for now is if I make the transfer this week for you're in Timber I will still have um two transfers in 2728 to make. It's very likely that one of those transfers is Palmer Tvertz. It's quite likely that one of the other transfers is going to be someone into Dango and maybe I would have skipped Thiago in game 828. But I I think I can live with that if I just have two Brenford attackers especially with well Thiago's ownership has been dropping but especially since I think a lot of the engaged fields still own Thiago. I don't necessarily mind sidest stepping that by going for other players who who could be you know exciting for me. Um, but yeah, maybe Shotti is also tough to touch, but Vertz and Dango will probably serve me well is is kind of the way that I'm thinking at this moment in time. So, that's going to be it for my team selection. As far as captaincy goes and even the triple captaincy piece, we can discuss that right now. I think I guess the argument is you play the fixtures. You kind of think about okay what it's like to own triple Arsenal defense which for all intents and purposes is definitely going to be above 300% ineffective ownership with the amount of triple captaincies that I've I've seen floated around from from a from a polling perspective on social media. So I think when you're think about the triple captaincy, you're basically saying, okay, is the additional 100% of Gabrielle, I guess, going to outscore future doubles, and is it a particularly good play because I'm kind of already backing the double Arsenal defense. So not that Arsenal have actually kept a clean sheet versus Wolves. They ironically, I guess, kept a clean sheet versus Brenford at home this season. But I I think Brenford in that game kind of rolled the red carpet for a team like Arsenal. Uh they benched Thiago at the time. They benched Collins when Collins wasn't really I guess benchable and then as we know the Wolves game was I I think a bit of a slip in terms of Arsenal at that point in the season but they did rectify that with Saka assists as far as I think this game I think of course clean sheet outs versus Wolves are going to be exceptionally high and then it's going to be Brenford away then the question to ask is are there better double game captaincies later down the line especially when you're probably going to bench boost in one of the other double game weeks. So, let's say when gaming 33 happens, a lot of people are generally speaking trying to angle for a wild card 32, bench boost 33. Um, and then gaming 36, you might not have a double or you could, of course, if there are suspensions, etc. I do think just throwing the triple captaincy makes a lot of sense this week. It actually removes a lot of decision-making headache for most managers. So, I don't really mind it. I think yes, of course, going for a defender, it does seem painful, but we we we do know that this Arsenal team probably give you better clean sheet. um kind of odds than than any other team has, at least within sort of my experience of playing FPL cuz I didn't really play when that Chelsea Mourinho team were were a thing. But yeah, I I think Gabriel being a threat in terms of defcon and set pieces is quite huge. And as a triple defense owner, I guess going forwards, I'm probably right now in the mind of doing it. So let's just say the triple captain for Gabrielle is active. The vice captain will be on Yuri Timber. I think Timber's minutes will be fine. I I don't think I need to vice captain Rya, but if he plans to make a pen save, you know, hopefully he still saves it. But that's going to be my team for this week. I it it to me there's an element of maybe at the rank that I'm at, I just want to keep pushing on for greens. Is it greedy potentially? Or are there opportunities to kind of play with a bit more risk and a bit more flavor in terms of triple captainies? I certainly agree, but I think the fixtures are good enough. Um, and the player here in Gabrielle is good enough to justify a potential TC on. And I think that's all I really need. Like for example, when I did the Holland triple captain at the start of the season, I pretty much just said Burnley was clearly the worst team in the league and I wanted to use Holland versus Burnley. It wasn't about when people were going to triple captain for me. It was just about what was the most logical one just in terms of who do I think is the worst team and that's what I did in this case. I I I think there's not a huge chance that there's going to be a double game that's going to be that exceptional for some of the other players. And so right now I'm kind of leaning as I said if I'm going to bench boost on a game like 33 to actually go for Gabrielle. So that's where I'm leaning. Hope you guys let me know what your decisions are in terms of triple captain. I actually think there's a lot of diversified teams. So when I actually did my live stream for gaming 25, a lot of people actually moved into players like Havitz or Gokarez, you know, and some people were even shopping for some midfielders. So, you know, there's even a world where, let's say, if you think that the triple, sorry, the triple Arsenal defensive ownership is could be extremely high. If you own someone like Declan Rice, I don't think it's a crazy idea to suggest that maybe you would like to consider captaining him. In in my case, I suppose because I'm backing the defense, um it makes less sense for me to captain someone else clearly because all I can do is captain a defender. But I think for people who actually have a rice, maybe an attacker, there is an opportunity to kind of say, okay, sure, Arsenal are a team tilted towards defense and sure that we we know them for their defense, but there's still chances where you can lose clean sheets. This happens from time to time. They they've had a pretty barren run before recently starting again on getting the four clean sheets in five. So, who's to say that you can't advantage yourself from a risk perspective by going for a rice captaincy? So, have a think about that and yeah, I would like to know your thoughts in terms of triple captaincy as well. So, that's going to be it in terms of the team selection. Let's quickly jump into my transfer plans for the next few weeks. Right, so we're back here with my transfer plans here for Gaming 26. This is using the my team pick and rating tool in Fantasy Football Hub. You can actually find the tool within the link in description below. This is how I or this is the tool rather that I actually use every single week to kind of manage my decisions and to to just let me think about how I want to kind of play out a lot of my game weeks. As far as you know, gamweek 26 goes here. Um it's not suggesting the same things in terms of what I've decided. I do think I'll play LeFay over Muki and Krooppy Jr. But it clearly suggests it's quite a close 50/50 I would say in terms of somehow Muki is ahead probably because there's an element of this team has just been exceptional at home and then of course LeFay has the Liverpool game um and you know the the opportunity I guess to not concede more than two goals. So I think that there's an aspect there for Lefay and then of course Krippy Jr. has just been quite redhot in terms of goal striking and goal scoring this season. So he just generally has decent expected value despite sort of being a 65inutish player. So that that decision will probably go down to the wire. As I said though, I'm probably going to sell Muki if I'm honest. From a fixture perspective, clearly when you kind of look at the numbers, I think generally speaking, Sunderland's fixure run is actually a little bit worse than United's. So despite for example gaming 27, and we can talk about that in a moment. I guess if we actually look to gaming 27, like what team am I actually fielding here? So yes, of course they would recommend me to to play Muk Magcguire, but that's on the assumption that I don't have someone like Yuri Timber. Once I have Yuri Timber in the team, there's probably less of a reason for me to necessarily have four defenders. I I can probably sell one of the two. So I would have to still make a decision between Meguire and Mukle as it stands and and every single week subsequent to that, that's kind of the decision that I have to do, especially since I've got Richards with walls at home. But then of course fixtures do kind of turn a bit worse after that. So yeah, I have to decide between selling Muk Maguire. I I think I'm gonna go Meguire and and keep him. So, Mukle goes out for me. I buy Timber. That's going to be my team selection for gaming 26. I think this is as strong as a team I can really get out there to be honest. Like players have Thiago who doesn't have a great game. I don't have Jao Pedro in fairness within the attacking positions, but I'm quite happy still with Ekkit Tikk. And I do think I'll be holding Ekit going forwards because I'll just have the money to do so, especially when I move Palmer out of my team. And then in gaming 27, so this is unfortunate with Krooppy Jr. on the bench, but as we know, of course, Sabo is suspended. So I would just be playing Krooppy Junior ahead of him or maybe an Enzo Lefay. King 27. I think I'm going to go for a Dango move here. It's it's a good way for me to to still play Sabo. I would say probably noning Forest away, but we'll we'll see whether I actually end up playing um Sabo or or Krooppy Jr. one over the other. West Ham away is obviously a much better game for Koopa Jr., but the 65 minutes piece of thing always kind of makes me doubt whether I should play him over like a 90-minute player like so. So, I look forward to that 50/50. I think the last time I made that decision, I did have Krooppy Jr. behind So on the bench, and I got lucky with an auto sub. So, we'll see when we revisit that decision. But yeah, so so gaming 27, I think I'm probably just going to go for Dango here. And so going back to the argument of why would I sell Muki, I kind of think Richards versus Wolves at home is much better than Muki versus Fulham at home. So I don't really mind it too much. If I go Lefay to Dango here, this might actually make my team a bit worse because arguably someone like Enzo is, you know, someone who doesn't have great games with the Arsenal way. But I still think that selling Enzil if I can afford to do so. As you guys can see, it's an extremely extremely tight move. I think Dangle will rise to 5.9. Probably by the time that I've recorded this video and you're watching this video, he probably is already going to be 5.9. So, the tricky piece, I suppose, is if he goes to 5.9, is this move affordable for me? Probably not, because I can imagine Dango could rise twice. At the same time, it's hard to say whether he would because I don't know how much people have a preference for buying Arsenal players or buy buying players who are against Arsenal. But we'll just think about this as a move. Optimize my team. So that's Diego very very strong and he gets into the squad here as well in game 28. I do plan on just simply making Palmer to to warts the the move of choice for myself right now versus kind of expected value seems to be a little bit lower. I guess the alternative is always going for someone like Emmo. You know, United still have very much a good fixture run from here on out. So, it's a case of kind of me betting versus Li on Liverpool or I guess a little bit more into United. I will reserve judgment for now. I think a seems like a great pick, but I I also think that Verts is still very very interesting to me. So, I'm probably going to go for Vertz. Let's see how things unfold. But that's the type of move that still leaves me with a lot of money in the bank and you know that that makes things fun in FPL. For gameweek 29 though as we can kind of go towards here. This is where we I mean don't have too many decisions to make like this is still a very very strong team on my part. So I'm not too worried about the state of my squad here on a week for example where Enzo's got Aston Villa away. I can see myself actually playing someone like Dango in in this match here and keeping the team as is. So really, I think I would like to just roll up until gaming 31. Give me 30 is probably not the best week for my team. Um I I think there's an opportunity for example where if let's say I I didn't go so aggressively towards Dango and gave me 27, I probably could have sold Enzo at some point in time as well and maybe I've kept Lefay. But if I'm pursuing these kinds of moves and Meguire is actually fit, as you guys can see, I don't think my team really suffers too much um at all. I I would probably be playing Sabo and Vertz over Meguire and a Krooppy Jr. in most of these weeks except for maybe this Burnley match, but generally speaking, I've got a lot of depth in the team. I've got a lot of decisions to make and that that's just a positive in FPL for me. In gaming 31, this is the team as it stands, right? So, Richards is going to blank. The Arsenal players in my team are going to blank and Holland's going to blank. Now, I think the benefit of course of just having Dravka is I don't need to make a goalkeeper move or rather that's actually the benefit of owning Rya. But with a lot of free transfers to boot here, I think we just go out of Richards into probably maybe just a Brenford defender on this week, right? So on game 31, you're kind of just dead ending. So you just want a defender who's actually solid. I don't know who that's going to be. It could probably be Vandenberg at this point in time, but we'll just have to kind of wait and see what happens with regards to who's actually playing the Brenford back line cuz that's changed almost like every single week after an injury has kind of come out. and the front line's kind of fine, but I think I think if I remember correctly, there's a really good Aston Villa fixture here. So, I I think that the dead end would work quite well if I just went for someone like Watkins, which as you can see is doable. I can probably just go Holland to Watkins here. I'm assuming that Holland would actually drop in price a little bit, but this does lose me a lot of sell value in in someone like Holland. So, I'll have to kind of monitor that piece as well. And then yeah, defensively maybe we can actually just go for cash just to bank on this great fixture. So that's a potential move that I can make and and that all comes from generally speaking rolling from a long time out going back to like let's say gamew week 29, right? So I definitely make moves on 27. I definitely make moves on 28. After this point in time, I think 29 plus, it's almost a question of, you know, do I do I place more faith into United? Do I play place more faith into Liverpool? I would have made that decision already in terms of going forwards by then, but I but I think Dango and Sabo and Vertz are all really good midfield picks still to have. I'm not saying that they're better than any other team's midfield picks, but these are the players that I already kind of own or want to get to. Um, they have low ownership and I think they're some of the best picks that are available to us in the midfield position that still have really good expected points, but as I said, have that low ownership. So that's kind of what I'm thinking about as Emba for example continues to rise in terms of ownership or you know people are for example I guess going more into Rogers or going back into Rogers because I know he got a price drop recently. I I think you know my natural temptation is to just kind of play a little bit riskier and just go for some of the other picks that I think can have good competing minutes and and and had good competing expected value. So that's my general transfer plan. Hopefully it kind of sorts out transfers for most people. I would say just a general point of advice, I am in a very risky position in terms of I've got one free transfer and I'm still using that free transfer. This week he gave me 26 to get an Arsenal player. So I am a little bit behind other managers in the world, but I think of course the benefit is Cole Palmer basically gave me a massive gift in terms of that, right? So I don't feel too bad about that because of course points are on the board. But for other people who have rolled free transfers, don't fret too much. you're probably actually rolling here in gaming 26 or you have the opportunity to do quite soft good moves like for example a krippy junior to Aman potentially or a krippy junior to a tool if you have money in the bank. Um so there's lots of opportunities for managers maybe even a jo in in the goalkeeping position. I don't love it personally, so I'd probably skirt that. But just to give you ideas in terms of what you can do in in this week, whereas I think a lot of us are still going to be saving those free transfers to get, you know, deep into Brenford and gave me 27 28. Um, I unfortunately, as I said, will will be a bit behind other managers, but I think I guess the advantage that I have is that I've got Paul Morenzo still for Gaming 27, whereas maybe people might be a little bit deeper in terms of their Brenford ownership at that point in time. So, we'll just have to revisit that and see how things go. Uh, but that's me signing off for my team selection transfer plans as well from a Gaming 26 perspective. Thank you guys so much for watching. I'll see you guys soon for more content. Take care and goodbye."

      "transcript": "It's time for your Gameweek 27 transfer tips. One player you should buy, one you should sell, one you should keep, and one you should avoid by Thiago. And whilst the league's second top goal scorer has disappointed in some recent tough fixtures, one thing is certain. Good fixtures breed good form. And you know what? I don't even think Thiago has been playing badly, he's just been a bit unfortunate with fixtures and not getting as much service as he needs. He had the best chances of the game in a tough performance uh and an excellent performance really against Arsenal. And with Bryson, Burnley, Bournemouth, Wolves, leads and Everton in the next six, I think that changes. He's playing some of the very weakest defenses in the league, in particular against teams that concede a lot of chances from central areas from strikers. So whilst the unengaged FPL managers will simply look at points and say Thiago is not worth it, those in the no will snap him up whilst his stock is low, buy the dip and reap the rewards. Cell Tarovski. Now, unfortunately, Everton just have a pretty tragic run of games. Now, they face Man United, Newcastle away. Burnley, Arsenal, Chelsea, Brenford, and Liverpool in the next run. Outside of that Burnley game, Tarovski isn't really playable. And for 5.7 million, you can't really be benching him for six out of seven game weeks. That's just a poor use of budget. Maybe he could be forgiven if he was still getting defensive contributions or Pigford was still bailing his team out for clean sheets. But it seems the points have dried up and pretty much any Everton defender or indeed goalkeeper can be sold. Keep Enzo. This guy went from scamming points to dodging them within the space of two weeks. Back-to-back blanks may fool you into thinking that Enzo is no longer involved in the attack, but it's just not true. In fact, during this twoame week period, if you take away the penalties, no Chelsea player has generated more expected goal involvements than Enzo. That means he's putting up better numbers than Joel Pedro. And he's putting up better non-penalty numbers than even Palmer, which means if there are no penalties against Burnley, which I wouldn't hold my breath on, by the way, Enzo is just as good as the more fashionable Chelsea attackers right now. Avoid Joel Pedro. Now, I cannot stress this enough. If you already have Joel Pedro, you should 100% keep him. You should maybe even think about captaining him. But if you haven't bought him yet, you're kind of too late at this point. Burnley at home this week is a great fixture. And I think he will get points here. But after that, he faces Arsenal away, Villa away, Newcastle, Everton, Man City, Man United. This is the worst run of fixtures of any team in the Premier League after Gameweek 27 for Chelsea. And whilst he has thrived against some weaker oppositions and scammed three penalty assists in uh two games from dumb opponents pushing him over beyond gameweek 27, you're probably going to want to sell him anyway. So the real question is if you're only just buying him now, is it worth two transfers? One to buy him this week and another to sell him next week. So congratulations genuinely to those who had the foresight to bring him in early. But for those only thinking about it now, I think you missed the boat.

      "transcript": "I asked 100 FPL experts for their gameweek 27 transfer moves, captains, and chip strategies so you guys can follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Welcome to FPL, mate. My name is Dan. We are back with another experts video for gameweek 27. A massive shout out to all of our experts who volunteered their data for this new gameweek. Um, it's going to be an interesting one, particularly for captains, as you will soon see in this video, guys. So, uh, stay tuned for that. lots to discuss. So, let's start off with the transfers and chips. And whilst there are some transfers being made, actually the majority of our experts will be rolling this week. But given that it is kind of roughly almost 50/50, I don't think I lean one particular way. If you need to make transfers, you need to make transfers. But if you can afford to roll, you will be in the company of 54% of expert managers, which is also pretty good company to be in. But 33% of our experts will be making one transfer this game week. Just the one. 12% will be making two. and just 1% making three transfers in game read 27. Not any of our wild our experts are on a wild card or a free hit. So don't even think about it. No trends there. And in terms of chips generally speaking, no bench boost. We have two using the triple captain chip. And we'll reveal who our experts are using that triple captain chip on later on in the video. But um yeah, it is a maybe a a small opportunity for triple captain if you do really want to and if you didn't use it last week on Gabrielle. But it's by no means something that you need to do. There are going to be hopefully some more opportunities in future gameweeks. And of course, if you haven't checked out my uh my chip strategy video from yesterday, I definitely recommend checking that one out if you want kind of more information on what your options are in terms of those remaining chips. Let's check out the global trends in the FPL world. What are the overall player base up to? And do our experts agree? Well, one player they certainly do agree on, and that is that Thiago is going to be a good transfer in. Now the transfer numbers in general are not super high among the overall player base this gameweek. So that maybe suggests that either some people are waiting so I don't know how these trends will end up going but outside of Thiago Palmer Semeno Hill Virgil and Ryan are all players that our experts are somewhat interested in. Rogers and Bruno are pretty highly owned among experts. So line not so much but none of these players see new interest among experts. But the headline here, guys, is that Joah Pedro, the most popular transfer in in the overall player base. Our experts are just not interested in bringing this player in at all. Now, granted, a few of our experts do own him already. He's owned by around 19% of experts right now, but uh yeah, no one's really bringing him in. So, if you don't already have Joel Pedro, it genuinely might be a little bit too late for that one to be totally honest with you guys. Only one good fixture left. And if you're not going to captain him, he's probably not worth buying to be honest. But if you already have him, obviously that's amazing. But just to let you know guys, whilst the overall player base love Joel Pedro as a new transfer in this week, the experts simply do not. Let's check out who they are transferring out before we look at the transfers in. And it is Declan Rice that is seeing the largest volume of transfers out. Now, of course, he is massively owned by experts and 86% had him for his double gameweek in 26 and that will be dropping down to 70% ahead of his non-double gameweek in gameweek 27. Certainly with Declan Rice looking to blank in gameweek 31, there will be, you know, generally with Arsenal and maybe Wolves players, we are going to see them start to trend downwards over the coming weeks as we build towards that blank game week. But certainly Rice is not a must-sell player. The majority of experts will be keeping him, but if you do have a midfielder in mind that you'd like to bring in this week, he's certainly a player that could be sacrificed. Bruno G with his long-term injury is being transferred out by all of his current owners in the the world of FPL experts, I suppose. Evan Nilson, four transfers out for him, slashing his ownership almost in half. So, definitely a player losing popularity after a few blanks. Euran Timber with a few transfers out here as well. Mané, Tarovski, Harland, three transfers out each. A lot of our our experts are waiting on the injury status on Harland and we may see some more transfers out for him if Harland is indeed injured out for this gameweek, but we'll have to wait and see on that one. We're still waiting for press conferences, so difficult to give an accurate answer on that one, but a lot of the experts did kind of say, you know, if Harland is going to be out, then maybe that changes things. But right now, only a few planned transfers out for him. A couple of transfers out for the likes of Kuna, Doru, and Mark Guu. And one thing in particular, I think players like Mark U and Mane, that third cheap forward position, we're going to start to see more and more of these third cheap forward slots kind of being transferred out in upcoming gameweeks as uh a lot of people look towards building a solid 11 players for gameweek 31. and players like Mark U Mané just are not going to cut the mustard in game 31 unfortunately alongside a lot of those Arsenal Man City and Crystal Palace players which I expect all of whom to start to trend downwards but no clear patterns in terms of transfers out this game week. Maybe we've got some better ideas for transfers in. But before we have a look guys, make sure you do drop a like on the video. It massively helps out and do feel free to subscribe as well. We are shooting for 250,000 subscribers by the summer. Let's see if you we can do it if you haven't subscribed already. It really helps you guys receive these videos in your algorithm if they are the kind of thing you like. Let's check out transfers in among experts. And yeah, there are two players who both play for the same team that are super popular right now. And I think whilst for a lot of players the best jumping on point might actually be next game week, gameweek 28, where we might see a lot more transfers, a lot more variety of transfers. For this gameweek 27, it's actually a pretty good jumping on point for Brenford players because their good fixtures really do start now. And that's why we see Thiago and Dango as the two most popular transfers in among experts this week. Thiago kind of expected to see this 13 transfers in and he is the number one most transferred in uh player among experts and that's despite 42% of experts already owning him. So he is going to increase and increase. He's going to go to over half of experts are going to have him in their team. So be aware of that one guys. And Dango is a little bit more interesting because he's a he's a differential. Like there's no other way of saying it. Very few people had Dango before this game week, but now the fixtures are turning very, very good. I think more experts are going to be bringing him in this week. 11 new transfers in for the cheap 5.8 million Brenford midfielder. Not too bad. There are some uh transfers in for Palmer and I think a lot of that is to do with targeting captaincy for Palmer against Burnley this game week. So, pretty interesting one there, guys. Yeah, six new transfers in in addition to his 10 old owners, I guess. So, there'll be 16% of experts will have Palmer in their team ahead of this new gameweek with a few, I imagine, selling him the week after that. But, we'll have to wait and see on that one. That's for next uh next episode, for next week. Hill. Finally, we are continuing to see Hill uh appreciated by the masses. Five new transfers in for him in addition to the 17% of experts who had him last week. Uh just a cheap beast in the world of FPL right now. Five new transfers in for Virgil as well. So, you know, significant interest there. Semeno with a few more transfers in. He is going to be in around a quarter of expert teams by the time we hit deadline this week. Ryan differential, three new transfers in for him. Same with Shardai. We're seeing a few differential transfers in this gameweek to be fair among experts. Pretty exciting stuff. Um, yeah, Ryan is just looks really good right now, but you know, we don't know too much about him, but what we've seen so far, it looks good and he's very cheap. Sharda may be an alternative to Dango, but it does seem that to be that the experts do prefer Dango to Sharda. Um, mostly going to be because of that cheaper price tag for a similar kind of result. Couple of transfers in for Rogers and Verts, but nothing too interesting to say there. Don't think two transfers really counts as a expert trend and that's what this video is all about. Checking out the template guys. No change on the goalkeepers, not too much change on the defenders, but Timber has dropped in ownership a little bit and Hill now enters the template due to his five new owners. He's up to 22% and that is going to allow him to leaprog Alderete as the fifth most popular defender among experts. In midfield, no change in terms of the personnel here. Rice receives a significant drop, but no individual midfielder has gained enough traction this gameweek to enter into the into the template in the top five popular midfielders here. So, there you go. Um, interestingly, no one's selling Enzo. I know Enzo is a pretty popular cell this game week for some reason, but none of our experts are selling him. Everyone's keeping him. And in terms of those forwards, a little drop for Harland, decent increase for Thiago to be fair, and a small increase even for Ech. So I think we are going to see this uh front three become really the expert template. Harland, Thiago, Ekit. I think a lot of experts will be looking to roll and rock with this front three for the upcoming gamewigs. Difficult to say average current ranks and scores because I'm recording this before the Arsenal game, but so far no good. After the Arsenal game, hopefully our experts will be seeing certainly a few more green arrows in there. We'll have to wait and see for that one. So, can't really um judge that too much. But you guys will be watching this video after the Arsenal game has finished. So, let me know what were your final scores in gameweek 26. Did you get on well or you know, was it a little bit of a struggle all the way to the finish line of the gameweek? Based on all of that guys, I think we can make some rough suggested transfers. I think certainly if you are selling Declan Rice going for either Dango if you don't have the budget or if you want to go for a oneweek punt captain shout then moving Rice to to Palmer if you have the money could also work pretty well. I've seen a few people doing Rice to Semeno as well. So those are the kind of midfield options that you kind of got going on that are kind of supported by our expert data this week. But if you do want to go for some other positions, for example, if you were to bring in Thiago, you might be looking to sell someone like uh Evan Nilson. But if you have a cheaper forward like Mane or Marku, maybe that is going to be another way. Or even Obi and maybe that's going to be another way of getting uh Thiago in if you do have the money in your back pocket. If you are looking for a new defender, Hill and Virgil seem to be the most popular guys. So maybe something like a a a Tarovski to Hill if you want to free up some budget could work. Doo to Hill would work as well if you still have him in your squad. And finally for captains, guys, and we have a right old variety here. Wow. With nine different captains being selected by our experts, this is one of the widest arrays of genuine captain options we've seen all season because we actually have a few trends here as well. It's not just a whole bunch of players being captained by one uh expert each. We've got a couple of trends here which is nice. So, first of all, let's talk about Harland. Now, 55% of our experts said that they will be captaining Harland this gameweek. That accounts for 59% of his ownership. A lot of them did kind of say that if Harland is unavailable for this week then they'll be captaining Bruno Fernandez if they have him or maybe Joel Pedro if they have him. One of the other guys basically in the top four if Harland is unavailable. But certainly we are seeing a case where if Harland is available at home against Newcastle the majority of experts will be going this direction for their captaincy. But at 55% or 59% of owners that is far from conclusive and actually there is a lot of experts almost half of experts going a very different direction in terms of their captaincy list. So let's talk about Bruno Fernandez first of all 16 of our experts will be captaining him but out of 96 owners and by the way Bruno is kind of the most popular um FBL asset now pretty much I think outside of Gabrielle who is actually no Bruno is is slightly ahead of Gabrielle. So Bruno is the most popular player among experts right now. So actually even though we do see 16 captains from him as a percentage of his ownership, it's not crazy high. I mean it is a trend, don't get me wrong. It's certainly something to be considered. But what's really interesting is if you're not going for Harland and you have some of these Chelsea players, Palmer Jal Pedro. So let's talk about Palmer. First of all, at home against Burnley, he is owned by 16% of our experts and 12 of them will be captaining him, which means Palmer has a captaincy rate among owners of 75%. Which means to me, it's pretty obvious if you have Palmer, the experts think you should captain him. Pretty simple, right? And even the triple captains, the two triple captains being used in this gameweek among experts are both being used on Cole Palmer against Burnley because we know it's the best fixture of the season. We know Palmer has that ability to score those crazy points. Not saying it's guaranteed that it will happen, but he has that in his locker to get that 20 point plus haul in there. So, it is a consideration to triple captain. I don't think we need to take it too seriously just because we're not seeing any real strong trends towards it and there will be other options. But I think if you do have Palmer, he is definitely captain material. And even Joah Pedro here, of course, 59% of Harland owners will be captaining him, but 47% of Joel Pedro owners will be captaining him, which is definitely worth taking note of. So nine out of the 19 Joel Pedro owners that are part of our expert group will be captaining him as well. Interesting stuff. Three captains for Enzo. Not really too much here, but it's worth at least having a little look at. Echk with two captains here as well, which I thought was interesting. Didn't expect to see that, but here we are. And a little bit lower than that, we got some kind of one-off captains from individual experts. Um, two targeting that Crystal Palace versus Wolves game, one on S, one on Mos, and one of our experts even captaining Semeno against Newcastle. And considering Semeno's form, I can't say I totally blame them. If you like Harland, kind of have to like Semanuel as well. And let's wrap up with some bonus questions, guys. First of all, uh I asked our experts in the private Discord channel. Are Chelsea players still worth buying with only one good fixture remaining? And both of these questions are kind of related to buying players. Chelsea and Man City players, Chelsea because they literally only have one good fixture and then they have terrible fixtures after Burnley. And also we asked about Man City because um they have decent fixtures in the short term, but we're expecting them to blank in gameweek 31. So let's start off with Chelsea. Um 13% said yes, it's what it's still worth the risk going for a Chelsea player. 31% said yes, but only if you have a lot of spare free transfers so you can remove them again afterwards. And we saw 56% of our experts said the majority view is actually it is just too late to buy Chelsea players. No one is worth considering anymore. Move on. target the next uh the next players with the nice runner fixtures. So yeah, if you are wondering about whether you should buy Chelsea players or not, um the majority of our experts say no, don't even bother going there. Just ignore them now. But there is still 31% I think that's a decent chunk. Uh you know, if you include the 13% as well, there's still a decent chunk saying that if you do have some spare free transfers, then maybe you could go for it. So leave that with you guys. If you wanted the experts opinion on that one though, that is it. Um, as for Man City players, very, very different results. And I think that's because Man City genuinely do have a lot of good fixtures coming up. So, it's not so much of a oneweek punt. It's more like a four week punt before you're going to have to transfer these guys back out again, which is uh far more significant than one week, isn't it? Four times more significant. In fact, ah, we do love data on this channel. But anyway, should you buy Man City players? Are they still worth buying even with an upcoming blank? Uh, 25% said yes. It is still worth the risk no matter what, even with just one transfer. But 75%, the vast majority said that yes, it is only worth it if you have many free transfers to depend on taking them back out later essentially. Um outside of that, no one, you know, said, you know, it's too late or anything like that. So our experts are still on board with potentially buying Man City players if you want to. So um hopefully that maybe clears up some questions that you guys have. The bonus questions are there just to answer some of those additional questions and kind of give a nice uh idea on what the majority of experts are saying. So hopefully there was loads of good stuff in today's video. I certainly thought there was. Let me know guys who you will be captaining and which players you're thinking about transferring in and out. Are you going different from the experts or are they going to do something pretty similar? Let me know your ranks as well. Do drop a like, subscribe, and uh check out the chip strategy video from yesterday, guys. Honestly, it's a banger. is going to tell you everything you need to know about doubles, blanks, and the chips. Um, check it out and I'll see you later, mates."

      "transcript": "We have new information about the double and blank game weeks coming up soon. So today I'm going to share everything we know right now as well as the best chip strategies to succeed in FPL. Welcome to FPL mate. My name is Dan and it's going to be another super important fixture changes and chip strategy video today. If you've already used your wild card, this is going to be a crucial video for you to watch as there are things you need to be doing and thinking about right now. now. And if you've still got your wild card in hand, I think you're going to like what you see today. We're going to go through all of the upcoming double and blank game weeks, which teams are most likely to double when and against who, and we're going to look at three different chip strategies to best take advantage of the situation that we find ourselves in. And the situation, by the way, is maximum chaos. The planning has well and truly begun, and I really think by the end of this video, you guys are going to feel so much smarter. Um, a lot of nerding out has come into this video over the past couple of days. So much so, I need to put on the nerd glasses for this video. So, let's start right here, guys. The most important game you need to remember between now and the end of the season. And we're going to take these off so we can actually read correctly. But basically, between now and gameweek 13, we have no interesting weeks, no doubles, no blanks. Gameweek 31 is a blank gameweek as things currently stand. Arsenal, Wolves, Man City, and Crystal Palace will have no fixture in gameweek 31, but this may actually change. Gameweek 32 is likely to be a normal gameweek and uh gameweek 33 is going to be the largest double gameweek of the season. A maximum of 10 teams can double here. But the most likely outcome is that we see eight teams doubling. There's also a small chance of only six teams doubling here, though. Uh anything less than six is pretty unlikely at this point. So, it's going to be a big double, the biggest of the season, bigger than anything else we'll see. Uh, I've had a few comments from people asking about free hitting in blank gameweek 31. But if you think you're going to have a depleted squad in gameweek 31, wait until you hear about its big brother. Yes, gameweek 34 will be the biggest blank gameweek of the season with a maximum of eight teams with no fixture whatsoever. So, if you don't have a plan for gameweek 34, I don't know how to put this lightly, but you could be screwed. Uh this gameweek 33 to gameweek 34 pair of weekends could make or break seasons. But anyway, gameweek 35 is probably going to be normal. Gameweek 36 is the second best chance of a double gameweek this season with a maximum of four teams doubling. Two teams doubling here is perhaps more likely, but honestly based on current information, I would say that there's actually a less than 50% chance of any teams doubling in this gaming. So, there is a possibility, but it's not like uh more likely than not, if that makes sense. Uh, in fact, outside of gameweek 33, there is a very fair possibility that we will see zero other double gameweeks this season. So, be aware of that when you're planning your chips out. Gameweek 37 I previously had as a possible double and a possible blank. Uh, blanks here are now impossible because it would require a team to reach both the final of the FA Cup and the final of the Europa League. And since Aston Villa and Forest are out of the FA Cup, this is no longer going to be possible. Uh doubles are still technically possible in 37, but I don't think it's that likely. Certainly not likely enough to warrant spending too much time talking about it right now. Um FA Cup finalists will most likely have their fixtures moved from the weekend of Gameweek 37 to the midweek of gameweek 37, keeping the fixtures within the same gameweek. And there should be plenty of other midweek slots to schedule any other fixtures or unscheduled fixtures. So gameweek 37, I don't think it's really going to be needed this season. So that's the general landscape. Small blank gameweek in 31, big double gameweek in 33, big blank in 34, and a possible small double in gameweek 36. And loads of other kind of fringe possibilities that are, I guess, not likely enough to justify talking about in this YouTube video. I could go on and on about all of the possibilities, but I want to keep this simple and useful. But if you do have any questions or ideas about the other possibilities, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll be more than happy to reply to anyone who is maybe nerding out even more on all of the possibilities and we can have a chat about that because I have looked through it. I just don't think it's super relevant to talk about today. With that said, guys, we need to move on to which specific teams are going to uh double and blank and when that is likely to be. As we mentioned, nothing interesting is likely to happen between now and gameweek 30. So, let's race ahead to gameweek 31 where the fun really begins. The gameweek 31 to gameweek 38 period is what I like to call chip season, and you'll soon see why. So, let's start off with the basics. The most likely situation uh will be that the uh basically any teams that reach the FA Cup semifinals will have their fixture moved from gameweek 34 to gameweek 33. So let's take an example. Say uh let's say Arsenal reach the FA Cup semi-finals. And yes, um the choice of team Arsenal is maybe a little bit biased on my part, but if Arsenal reach the FA Cup semi-finals, they will have their gameweek 34 fixture against Newcastle in theory moved into gameweek 33. This will create a double gameweek for themselves and their opponent Newcastle in gameweek 33 and a blank uh gameweek for themselves and Newcastle in gameweek 34. Nice and easy stuff so far. So now let's say that four teams, four Premier League teams, they all reach the FA Cup semi-finals. Let's just choose Arsenal, Man City, Liverpool, and Chelsea again as an example. And now we can see all of these teams and their opponents, Newcastle, Burnley, Crystal Palace, and Brighton all doubling in 33 but blanking in 34. If we see less Premier League teams reach the semi-finals, then that means less less fixtures have a chance to be moved. And if two teams reach the semi-finals who already play against each other, so for example, if both Arsenal and Newcastle reach the semi-finals, because they already play each other in gameweek 34, that is one less fixture that will need to be moved from 34 into 33. All of this would create a scenario where the teams who double in 33 are the exact same teams who blank in 34. Now, this is super important because it means that the double gameweek players that you will desperately want in your squad in gameweek 33, these are going to be the exact same players who you will want nowhere near your squad in gameweek 34, at least in an ideal world. Your ideal gameweek 33 squad will be the complete opposite of your ideal gameweek 34 squad. And the only way to transition between one FPL team to another FPL team uh entirely different for the following week is going to be by using a chip. So with that said, at the absolute minimum, you will need to save one of your free hit or wild card for the gameweek 33 to gameweek 34 transition. If you've already used your wild card, don't even think about touching that free hit chip until the gameweek 33 to 34 transition. you know who you are. You've got your finger wandering around that free hit button. Save it. You got to save it. Um and of course vice versa. If you have already used your free hit, you're going to have to save your wild card. Um if you've used both of your wild card and free hit by the time gameweek 33 and 34 come around, there's no real way of uh kind of sugar coating this. Um you will drop down in the ranks. Um wellprepared FPL managers will thrive in this moment. and the impatient or unaware uh FPL managers will kind of be punished. Uh which is why watching videos like this is is so important. So with that said, guys, please do drop a like and subscribe for more. We're aiming to hit 250,000 subscribers by the summer, and I can only do it with your help. Subscribing helps to ensure that similar content is going to be recommended to you in the future. So, when we have more updates on doubles and blank game rigs, these videos will hit your algorithm and you will stay in the know with all of the latest info. So, guys, we do put a lot of work into these videos. We make sure that we understand everything that's going on. So, one, we can ensure that you guys have all of this information in as much detail as possible before anyone else. Um, before kind of other creators are kind of either using other people's uh calendars or whatever. um we try and get ahead of the game here and we try and understand it and a lot of work does go into it. So yeah, all support appreciated, likes, subscribes, this that and the other. That was a pretty shameless plug, right guys? But uh let's get back on topic. It's got to be done in the world of YouTube. So looking at this guys, uh these fixtures on screen are just hypotheticals to explain the kind of process we're going to be going through today. Um and we need to deal with the real situation now. So here's the latest. the FA Cup. A fifth round fixtures have been drawn. Uh Fulham versus Southampton, Bristol or Port Veil versus Sunderland, Newcastle versus Man City, Leeds versus Norwich, Mansfield versus Arsenal. Yes, Wolves versus Liverpool, Rexon versus Chelsea, and West Ham versus Brenford. Uh three of these games are all Premier League affairs. Liverpool, you would say, should be Wolves. West Ham versus Brenford is maybe a little tougher to call. and Newcastle versus Man City is the standout difficult fixture for both teams. Every other Premier League team faces a team in a lower division. Arsenal and Chelsea in particular, you would expect to qualify from this round and reach the quarterfinals at the very least. So, any Premier League team that wins here and then wins again in the following round can blank in gameweek 34 and double in gameweek 33 as uh along with their kind of previously scheduled gameweek 34 opponents. So that's where we're at. Nine teams are out of the FA Cup from the Premier League. Aston Villa, Bournemouth, Brighton, Burnley, Crystal Palace, Everton, Man United, Forest, and Spurs. But here's where things get a little bit interesting. Every single one of these teams, whether they are still in the FA Cup or not, still have a chance of getting that famous gameweek 33 double and Gameweek 34 blank. And this is the reason why. So, here we are back at the Gaming 34 fixtures that will be required to move should one of the participants of the fixture reach the FA Cup semifinals. And what you'll notice is that every single fixture here has a team still in the FA Cup. And outside of Arsenal versus Newcastle, every fixture is between one team who is still in the competition and another team who is out of the competition. This means so long as one of Arsenal or Newcastle get knocked out before the semi-finals, we have the opportunity to get at least eight doubles and eight blanks. Um, it's the maximum chaos situation, bigger and more extreme than last season, which makes chip planning more crucial this year than it was last year. If both Man City and and Liverpool are knocked out, I even think we have a high chance of that 10 team doubling. Uh 10 teams doubling in gaming 30 sorry. There is a a real real chance of that happening. So um that is going to be a story for another time. But one more note from here because Wolves play Liverpool and West Ham play Brenford in the next FA Cup round. That means that we will have two fixtures confirmed as nonblanks by gameweek 30. One of Wolves versus Spurs or Liverpool versus Palace will definitely go ahead and one of West Ham versus Everton and Man United versus Brenford will definitely go ahead. We'll cover this when we do the next fixtures and chip strategy video which is going to be ahead of Gameweek 30. So stay tuned for that one. So what are the chances of these uh Gameweek 34 fixtures being moved? Well, uh here are the odds. Uh these odds were taken from FBL Spaceman's 100,000 FA Cup simulations. Very good work from him. I think these are probably the most accurate odds that we have available right now, which is why we we're kind of using them. H and when we're particularly when we're trying to figure out the likeliness of teams reaching the FA Cup semi-finals and therefore having their fixtures moved. So, let's start at the top. Arsenal versus Newcastle is by far the best candidate for a blank gameweek in 34 and a indeed a gameweek 33 double created from that blank. So, not only do Arsenal have a favorable round of 16 fixture in the FA Cup, um which should help them qualify to the next round at the least, but Newcastle are still in the tournament as well, which means there are two teams and therefore two opportunities um to create a situation where this fixture has to be moved. One if Arsenal reach the semis, the other if Newcastle reach the semis. Every other fix fixture here relies on just one team to go all the way to the semis. Chelsea here have a 48% chance of reaching the semis. Uh this gives uh a near 50/50 chance of this being moved. Liverpool versus Palace is at 47% so pretty close too. Burnley versus Man City is down just 40% maybe a little less than you expected. And that's mostly because Man City have a tough fifth round fixture against Newcastle. Um which is really important because if City fail to reach the FA Cup semi-finals and they have a big blockade in Newcastle before they get there. um you know and and this fixture does end up going ahead in gameweek 34 because City don't reach the semi-finals. It massively damages the possibility of a second double gameweek in gameweek 36. So as things stand, gameweek 36 is really on the ropes here. We got Fulham versus Aston Villa at 35% chance of being moved. Bournemouth versus Leads at 34%. Man United versus Brenford 27%. Um I would personally love to see Man United double by the way. So, I'll be cheering on Brenford to reach the semi-finals. Sunderland vs. Forest is at 25% chance to be moved. West Ham versus Everton 18%. And since Wolves need to conquer both Liverpool and another team to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, they have a measly 9% chance to blank in gameweek 34 and have their fixture moved. So, based on this data, we can project 7.24 teams to have their fixtures moved. And it doesn't automatically mean that they will be all moved out of 34 into 33, but it gives us a real nice rough idea on what's possible. So that lands us here on the fixture calendar. Arsenal versus Newcastle, the prime candidate for blanks and doubles. Chelsea, Brighton, Liverpool, Palace City, and Burnley a little further behind with odds between 40 and 50% before we factor anything else in. And anything else is really just guesswork at this point. Most crucially at this moment, every single Premier League team has a chance, at least a chance, of a gameweek 33 double and a gameweek 34 blank. Though some clearly have a better chance than others. So, what's next? I'm very glad you asked, assuming you did. Uh, you may remember that Arsenal and Wolves had their gameweek 31 fixture moved to gameweek 26 due to the clash with the League Cup final. But what about fellow finalist Man City and their previously scheduled Gameweek 31 opponent, Crystal Palace? Where does this one go? Well, there are a few possibilities. Now, the first possibility requires us to address the elephant in the room. Um, so whilst there are plenty of of of like really obvious and kind of empty midweek slots to put these unscheduled Premier League fixes in, if a team isn't in a particular tournament that plays in the midweek or indeed the weekend, they could technically play there instead. So, if a team kind of needs to have their fixture move out of gameweek 34, for example, but for whatever reason gameweek 33 doesn't work, maybe there's a TV deal clash or, you know, there's a a tight turnaround between fixes. I don't know, there could be a bunch of reasons. Um, but that would mean that there's a small chance, small but nonzero chance that a fixture is moved to somewhere other than gameweek 33. I mean, uh, if a team and their opponent isn't in, uh, a European semi-final, they could even have their game stay within gameweek 34 and simply move to the midweek, um, and not blank at all. So, there are possibilities in which teams reach the FA Cup semi-final and still don't blank in 34. Yeah, again, small chances of these these things happening. Um, I don't think it's really very likely without a strong reason, but we do have to acknowledge the possibility at the very least. And that brings us to Man City versus Crystal Palace. Currently, this game is homeless. H But if Man City are knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle, it could go on the weekend of the kind of the the 3rd to the 6th of April. If Man City and Palace are both knocked out of Europe before the quarterfinals, then the fixture could be moved to the midweek between the 7th and 9th of April. Both of those slots are technically within gameweek 31, which would mean neither team would blank in gameweek 31 after all. They would simply have their fixture rescheduled back into gameweek 31, but just at a much much later on point uh which would be a very bizarre gameweek that would straddle an international break. Now, even if those uh they you know these teams are knocked out of their their competitions, Man City out of the FA Cup, both teams out of Europe, that doesn't automatically mean this fixture would go into or back into gameweek 31, but it is would therefore be possible for that to happen. So, there is still a small chance that Man City and Crystal Palace um have that that small chance of a fixture in gameweek 31 after all. So, they will unblank themselves if you like. Um I am guessing here because you know there's so many factors at play. A lot of them are nothing to do with with fixtures and results. Um so you can't really project what the uh what the Premier League might be thinking for example. So I am guessing. But on current information I would give this maybe a 10% chance of happening of both Man City and Crystal Palace actually having a fixture within gaming 31 after all. Um, but the next option is a little bit more obvious and that involves simply putting this fixture in the wide openen gameweek 36 midweek slot. There's no other competitions being played at this time which would mean the Premier League don't have to factor anything in. No TV TV deals, no clashes with Europe, no worries about, you know, competition or upsetting other competitions or anything like that. Really, really simple and elegant solution to the problem. Then we have gameweek 33. Now, if both Man City and Liverpool are out of the FA Cup, that leaves gameweek 33 wide open for both teams to play each other instead uh in here. So, um this could create the the kind of 10 team double gameweek scenario we mentioned earlier, but it would require both Man City and Liverpool to be out of the FA Cup um before the semi-finals. So, I don't know how likely that is. probably not very, but uh you know, stranger things have happened and it would open up a really interesting 10 team double gameweek. And indeed, even if one or both of Man City and Liverpool do reach the FA Cup semi-finals, the Premier League could just decide they want to prioritize rescheduling the gameweek 31 fixture before the Gameweek 34 fixtures. Um so that would kind of boost boost boot I guess any fixture that needs to be rescheduled from the FA Cups semis later into Gameweek 36. So, kind of things would just be pushed down the line a little bit. Um, kind of a knock-on effect. So, if just one of Man City and Liverpool reached the semi-finals and the other doesn't, I don't really see any real reason why this couldn't happen. And actually, it's it's Man City versus Crystal Palace that goes into game week 30 uh 33. I'm getting mixed up weeks now. Yeah, in game week 33. And actually it's the whatever it is whether it's a kind of Liverpool versus Crystal Palace or um Man City versus Burnley could actually end up being shoved later on into gameweek 36. So that's a very real possibility as well. Um that could [clears throat] very well happen. Um so that's a whole bunch of different possibilities without me even mentioning some of the less likely possibilities. But what it leaves us with is actually Man City and Palace with the highest chance of a double in gameweek 33 because they have multiple ways of kind of getting that double gameweek of requiring that double gameweek in 33. It opens up a few niche possibilities for gameweek 36. Though I really wouldn't hold my breath on a gameweek 36 double. It is still got a very good chance of happening, but it is so far from certain. There are some different possibilities that could happen in there. and it gives us a double and blank fixture calendar. Um, the first that I've seen anywhere on the internet of a double and blank uh game calendar. I'm sure other people will start to put some out in the near future. But yeah, I think this is the the best and most accurate calendar that I've seen anywhere on the internet. And hopefully this is going to be really useful for you guys if you do want to start planning ahead a little bit. And that's exactly what we're going to be doing right now when we talk about the trips next. All right guys, the nerding out must continue. And just a reminder guys, if you haven't liked the video yet, please do. Here are three chip strategy ideas that I have come up with based on the currently available information. Now, these things, these chip strategies may change a little bit as we get more information. And we are going to get more information before the Gameweek 30 deadline. And we're going to have a lot of things actually confirmed by Gameweek 32 as well. when we have more details and we can start to narrow down or all of the kind of guess work that we're doing at the moment and start to get a more accurate uh because with each chip strategy video we do things become more and more and more accurate. Um but it does take some time to get the the you know the the the perfect result if you like. Um so yeah strategies may change some strategies may become stronger some may become weaker. Um but we got to consider everything. Um, just to let you know guys, we will be able to make a much more accurate uh kind of double and blank gameweek prediction before the gameweek 30 deadline. And we will be making another video for gameweek 30 uh around chip strategies and stuff. Uh, those who don't have a wild card, you should probably be like 90% decided on your chip strategy by this point. Um, if you do have a wild card, you can be a little bit more flexible and you can actually wait until before the gameweek 32 deadline um before committing fully sending a chip strategy. Um, so that's good. Um, if you save all your all your chips before until gameweek 32 or at least excluding the trouble captain, which is less important this season, um, yeah, you can wait until gameweek 32 before deciding what you're going to do. No problem whatsoever, but always good to get some ideas. And here are some of mine. So, here is strategy number one. And uh yeah, please feel free to groan if you've heard of this strategy before because it is the template strategy. And this strategy involves making uh transfers with no regard to fixtures beyond Gameweek 31 in the short term. So, you're going to be making transfers ensuring you have 11 playingers for gameweek 31. Gameweek 31 is going to be a small blank gameweek. So, you shouldn't have too many issues here. just sell some Arsenal players, sell any Wolves players you have, and if if uh Man City and Crystal Palace end up blanking, which I think is 90% likely at this moment, then sell a couple of them guys as well, and you should be able to field 11 players for gameweek 31 with not much issue at all. Then what you're going to do is you're going to wild card in gameweek 32. So you don't really have to worry about anything beyond gameweek 32 because you you can wild card there. One small note, I mean, if you have a lot of team value invested in certain players, you may want to keep them and bench them in 31. But gameweek 32, uh, new me, new team, um, you're going to pick as many double gameweek 33 players as possible to maximize a gameweek 33 bench boost. Very nice. So, you're going to have a huge opportunity for bench boost. I think 33 could be nice for bench boost this season as well because there's a lot of cheap defenders who will get Defcon. You know, say you have a player, a defcon defender, a cheap defcon defender, whether that's an Anderson or a Richards or a Muki, I don't know, and they get, you know, two points for playing, two points for Defcon. And they do that twice. That's eight points right there per defender before they've even done anything. They've got no clean sheets, they got no bonus points, they got no attacking returns, and they've already got eight points, which is amazing. If you can do that for two defenders, 16 points. Get a goalkeeper who can score four points, then we're we're we're already up to 20 points. get a an extra attacker like you know a fifth midfielder or third forward on the bench as well. Maybe they only score two points and already we're a 22 point bench boost which in most seasons would be considered a successful bench boost. So you don't even need anything to happen as long as you can get plenty of double gameweek players which um with a wild card in 32 should be pretty easy to do. Um free hitting gameweek 34 to remove all of those blanking players. Um, if you still have your triple captain, use it on a future double gameweek if there is one. Gameweek 36 looks like the best candidate right now. That is not guaranteed. You may have to end up using the triple captain kind of uh reactionarily. Is that a word? Reactionarily, reactionally, I don't know. Um, because there may not be a double um later on in the season. And that's kind of why it is optional and why the triple captain is less important because yes, we're getting a big double game in 33 most likely, but actually outside of that, there's not too much going on in ways of doubles. So if you already use your your triple captain chip, it's not really going to affect your your chip strategy at all really. It's kind of unimportant. So uh yeah, weak weak season for triple captain, but um still um there is still plenty of other chips that you can get a lot of power from. So that is strategy number one. It's the template strategy. It's the strategy that a lot of people will be doing. Um, you'll probably, you may have seen other content creators or even myself talk about this strategy before. You may think it is boring. You may think it is uh uncreative. Fair enough. Uh, but if I'm totally honest with you guys, anyone who has spent any amount of time kind of looking at the fixtures and the doubles and what's likely to happen will kind of arrive at the conclusion that this is just super obvious as a strategy. It's just so obvious. It ticks every box. it kind of deals with every problem and it provides a solution for them. So this just seems like the best strategy based on current information and um yeah this is the one I strongly think I will be going for because it is just so obvious right now but there are some other options. So this is strategy number two and this is for those of you guys who have already used your wild card and you're not dead and buried yet guys don't you worry there's still plenty to be done. So, this strategy is going to involve prioritizing players who have a fixture in gameweek 31. That either means keeping or buying players who have a fixture in uh blank gameweek 31. Trying to get I think 10 players. 10 playingers for 31 would be fine. Obviously, 11 is preferable if you can get a full squad out. Um but you're also kind of wanting to keep an eye on players who also double in 33. So, if you can get players who have a fixture in 31, but also double in 33, then that would probably be a good thing. Of course, we don't know for sure who those uh teams are going to be, but we need to keep an eye on it. We need to keep an eye on what's most likely to happen as well. If you've already wild card, it's going to be really important to keep an eye on things and really keep your head in the game. St stay ahead of the game and eyes on the prize, eyes on the ball. There's a bunch of cliches for you. Um after that, you're going to use your bench boost in gameweek 33. um if you've if [clears throat] you've created a strong enough bench, which hopefully you'll be able to do. If not, you can use this chip kind of reactionarily later and I think maybe gameweek 35 looks like a potential candidate for a bench boost, not because of double gameweeks or anything like that, but because some of the cheaper players have uh fairly good fixtures in gameweek 35. Um so, you know, maybe so, you know, Burnley versus Leads for example, maybe there's some cheapies there you can get. We got Sunderland versus Wolves. if you got some cheapies there as well. So, yeah, just uh some kind of examples for you guys. Um they could potentially work there, but uh I think generally speaking, bench boost still going to be 33 even if you haven't got a wild card to set it up. Gameweek 34 is still going to be your free hit to remove all of your blanking players. And if you still have your triple captain, uh you can use it on a future double gamewick, if there is one, your game 36 again looks like the best candidate. And here is strategy number three. And this is the Uno reverse strategy. It's uh kind of like the first strategy but kind of a little bit backwards. But I'll kind of explain why and why that might work. Um so stick with me guys. This one could really emerge as a better strategy depending on which teams end up kind of going through to the FA Cup semi-finals and having those blanks and having those doubles. If it is a different subset of teams than is currently projected, then it may change things a little bit. But let's go through this. So the reverse strategy. So make transfers with no regard beyond gameweek 31 ensuring you have 11 playing players for blank gameweek 31. So same as the other strategies wild card in gameweek 32 but this time instead of picking players who double in 33 you're going to pick players who blank in 34. So ensuring that you have a playing 11 for gameweek 34 with little to no regard to who doubles in gameweek 33. Now, one possible advantage of doing this is that um one you can free hit in Gameweek 33 rather than the bench boost, which means you have the pick of the bunch. There is a world in which the best players for double gaming 33 that you think are going to be the best players in gamewick 32. By the time gam 33 comes around, maybe you've changed your mind. If you hit in 33, you've got one extra week of data to make your selections. Though, you do sacrifice the bench doublers, if that makes sense. Now the other advantage of doing it this way and free hitting in 33 is if gameweek 34 actually has some quite strong teams and quite strong players actually quite like to keep longterm. So for example let's say Arsenal end up you know getting booted out of the FA Cup in the quarterfinals and uh and so did Newcastle before the quarter in the quarterfinals maybe or before and suddenly Arsenal play in 34 and don't double in 33. But wait, you want to have Arsenal players in your team long term. So if you're wild carding Arsenal players in, you either have a situation where they're not doubling in 33 and you're bench boosting non-doublers or you don't include Arsenal players in your wild card team. So just so you can maximize your bench boost in 33, which wouldn't be ideal really. So you know, we can extend that to some other teams. I mean, Man City, I think it is highly unlikely that they will um not have a double in 33. So, Man City will probably be the players you want on your wild card. Um, you know, whether they free hit or not, I don't know, sorry, whether they double or not, but they will. Um, but seems like Manchester United and I think Manchester United not actually that likely to double in 33 and pretty likely to have a fixture in 34. If you want a lot of Manchester United uh players in your team long term, then you know maybe freehitting them out in 33 is a better idea than freehitting them in in gaming 34 and not having them as part of your long-term squad. Now, a lot of these kind of things are resolved by just saving loads of transfers. Um but you know there there there's just a world in which actually doing this kind of back to front a little bit could work. It does mean that your bench boost is going to be weaker, but actually in the scenario in which the a lot of the players who don't double are players you want longterm, actually this strategy is a lot better. Now, in this strategy, there is no natural place for the bench boost and indeed trouble captain chips, which is just going to probably default to 36 um if there's a double there. Um but bench boost again, you may be looking at gameweek 35 for a bench boost just because some of those cheaper players have some of the better fixtures there. So wild card and free hit would be sorted in this strategy. Bench boost and triple captain are very very difficult to place in this strategy to be to be honest and again you may have to kind of muddle through use them reactionarily and you know indeed if you've already used your bench boost in triple captain actually this maybe favors you using this strategy a little bit more as well. Um, if you've already used your bench boost, there is kind of less uh need, I guess, to to save, you know, to to leave gameweek 33 as an open gameweek. You can use a chip there. You can use your wild card there. You can use your free hit there. You can use uh your triple captain there as well if you've already used your bench boost in a previous gameweek. So, that could potentially work as well. Um, and kind of those are kind of I guess a few varieties of strategy 3, which is just a different it's just a reverse version of what we've seen already. So, those are the strategies I've come up with based on current information. I hope they were useful to you. I hope this video in general has been useful to you and uh yeah, um it's been fun to make and it's been some hard work to make. Um but I love learning about this stuff. I love understanding this stuff and uh I think it's really really useful as well and it's it's setting us a really nice platform really to kind of go into this next fixture period with some confidence when each game week passes and we have more narrowed down information. we kind of already know a little bit what to expect and uh we can prepare for various things which is great. Uh always helps to be prepared in the world of FPL. But that's going to be it from me today guys. If you did enjoy this one, drop a like, do subscribe. We'll be back for more videos throughout the w the week focusing more on transfers than chip strategy to be honest guys. And we did already upload buy, sell, keep avoid. You can check it out right there if you want to. Thanks so much for watching once again and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "Gameweek 27 is here and whilst gameweek 26 hasn't technically finished yet, we are already looking ahead at some transfers. So, in the calm before the storm, who should we be buying? Who should we be selling? Well, let's find out in this week's Why, Sell, Keep avoid. This video is split into two parts. The first of which we'll be looking at those players you may already have in your team and which ones you should keep and which ones you should sell. After that, we'll be looking at the players you don't have and which players you should buy and which you should avoid. Players will be tier listed with the best players at the top and the worst players at the bottom. Welcome to FPL mate. My name is Dan and welcome to the calm before the storm because in four gamew weeks time after the next four game weeks things are going to get a little bit crazy. We're going to have blanks, we're going to have doubles. will be talking about all of that in the video coming out probably on Tuesday because I am recording buy, sell, keep avoid a little bit earlier on Sunday because I do want to give myself a couple of days to work on a new chip strategy video which will be going over the latest double and blank gameweek, I guess, news, likeliness, all of that good stuff. So, today we're going to talk transfers, guys. And like I said, the next four game weeks are pretty straightforward. No doubles, no no blanks, everything looks great. So, let's start off with our forwards that we may already have in our team. And we're going to start off with the likes of Thiago, who I think if you have him in your team still, and I know he has blanked for a few game weeks, I would 100% be keeping him in my team. I mean, look at this run, guys. All green fixtures, all beautiful fixtures coming up. Um, we like the look of this a lot. Brighton, Burnley, Bournemouth, and Wolves in the next four. I think there's lots of points to be had. And certainly Thiago actually has been underperforming his data for once, which is crazy. 17 shots, 16 in the box, and six big chances in the past uh six game weeks. Of course, he is the main man penalty taker extraordinaire, and I'm sure there'll be a few more penalties with Dango back in the team, winning those penalties for him as he was doing kind of before he went off to AFCON. So, I really like the look of Thiago, and I think he's even worth talking about when we come to the buy section. Ekit, another player I would be looking to keep here. And I I know everyone is kind of going crazy over Joel Pedro right now, but did you know Ekik actually has better underlying data than Joel Pedro? And we'll come to that a little bit later when we talk about the Chelsea striker. But Ekk, the numbers here are really strong. Like similar to Thiago, 18 shots, 14 in the box, eight big chances with 2.78 xG. If you've been watching Ecato over the last couple of Premier League games, you will be surprised to see that he hasn't come away with more because he had has had some huge chances. He just needs to start finishing them off. Thankfully, Liverpool do have some good fixtures now. The fixtures are improving from here on, particularly from gameweek 28 onwards. They look really, really nice all the way up until gameweek 32 where you may be thinking about wild carding around about that kind of time. Ollie Watkins, another player I would maybe be looking to keep. his um his data has dropped a little bit. He is it is getting a little bit weaker and obviously there has been a couple of weaker performances. That said, I think from an attacker's perspective, the next three fixtures are quite nice. Uh leads, Wolves, and Chelsea at home. Chelsea concede a whole bunch of chances and I think Watkins still seems to be nailed on for minutes. I think there is definitely potential here, but this is a keep that doesn't come without some risks. So, one bit of news coming out of the gameweek 26 games was Harland substituted at Halime with a knee issue. Didn't play in the FA Cup game this weekend either, which means there is maybe some doubt around his availability for Newcastle. We do need to keep an eye on this. The issue is seemingly not too serious. So, I think he will be back very soon. And I do think, you know, he is going to be a player you would like to have from gameweek 28 onwards if he is going to be available because I think the fixtures are very good there for Man City. There's always going to be question marks around Harland's value for money, particularly when he's not in the best of form. Uh that said, uh what else are you going to spend the money on right now? There seems to be uh not too many options when it comes to expensive players. Maybe we'll have a look at a few of them though later on in the video. Um Harland however I think is most likely going to be a keep and the only kind of exception to that is if he is going to be out for a little bit longer because remember guys Man City are like 95% likely and we'll talk about this more in tomorrow uh well tomorrow the next day's video whenever it comes out our our strategy video um we're going to see Harle 95% chance of blanking in gameweek 31. No fixt during gameweek 31. If he is out actually for a couple of game weeks, then suddenly, you know, maybe he's only back for 29 and 30 or something like that and suddenly he's blanking again in 31, is there any point in keeping him at that point? Particularly if you're wild carding in 32 and maybe planning to bring him back in at that point anyway. So, if there is an injury, then I think Harland is going to be a cell if he's going to be out for a couple of game weeks. But, I think in all likeliness, he's probably going to be back. So, let's keep an eye on that one. Let's monitor it. Evan Nilson is going to be in here as well as a monitor. A slight dip in form recently, but I think the numbers are still reasonably good. They're not quite Thiago and Echitique levels, but they're okay. He is 7 million, which is not super cheap, but it's cheap enough where I think you can get away with keeping him if you want to. And the fixtures are certainly good enough to keep him as well. So, there are still are some things to like about Evan Nilson if you're happy to continue to take the risk on what is a fairly lowowned FPL asset. Calbert Lewin wants to monitor. The good fixtures are coming again reasonably soon. Of course, he missed out in gameweek 26 due to illness, but he is going to be available again for gameweek 27. No problem whatsoever there. Jared Bowen is kind of edging towards the cell category as well. But I think the Bulma at home fixture, he's going to be fine to keep for that one. And maybe after that, you could think about selling him if you do indeed still have him in your squad. Remember, he is a penalty taker like Cal Lewen, like probably Evan Nilson, too. So there is definitely some advantages to a lot of these guys on this list. You know if they get a penalty even if they haven't been performing recently suddenly things look very very different indeed. But Joarez is a player whose penalty status may be under scrutiny because Bukayo Saka is now fit back and available a little bit sooner than expected. So Yarez being a little bit of a rotation risk there. Another disappointing performance in gameweek 26 so far. Maybe he turns it around against Wolves. But yes, certainly he was a player who there were certain advantages to buying him ahead of a double gameweek. But given that the next two fixtures, Spurs, Chelsea, are pretty average fixtures. I don't think they're amazing fixtures or anything like that. And then in gameweek 31, we are going to have a blank gameweek for Arsenal, I think the appeal of Jockarez is largely disappearing. So definitely a player I would be more willing to sell. Walter still rotation risk player with pretty poor fixtures. So we'll be looking to sell him. Mateta as well with his long-term injury is going to be a fairly obvious sell. Crystal Palace, by the way, with another team with 95% blank likeliness in Gameweek 31. Into midfield. And yes, guys, indeed, some people are selling Bruno Fernandez. I believe he is the ninth most sold midfielder at time of recording ahead of Gameweek 27. And yeah, it's just it's it's not the one. He's just the guy right now. Um, he really is in terms of those midfielder picks. So, no way I'd be selling him. I think there are some pretty average fixtures in this run to be fair, but I think, you know, Man United have generally been in some good form. Maybe the West Ham game wasn't great in 26, but uh certainly with all of the set pieces, penalties, and everything that he's providing, I mean, 27 key passes, guys, in six game weeks. That is absolutely crazy stuff. So, no doubt about it. Bruno Fernandez is a player you're going to want to have in and around your FPL team. Morgan Rogers, another player I would definitely be looking to keep ahead of this run. Like I say, I do like the I like the look of this run of fixtures for Aston Villa more for an attacker than a defender. I think there's definitely some games where Rogers can uh really really perform. And in gameweek 31 where we are going to be struggling for players a little bit uh because of all of the blankers. Um Rogers plays West Ham which is a pretty good fixture there. Enzo another player to keep. I know he has been points dodging like crazy recently so it would seem. Um, Burnley at home up next. It's just not a game you would typically look to sell uh your players when they're about to play Burnley at home if you're at least happy about their minutes and at least they're, you know, providing something in ways of, you know, creating, taking shots, that kind of stuff, which Enzo certainly is. So, um, in my mind, he is probably going to be a keep for this week. And I think when we go into gameweek 28 where the fixtures do look a little bit more troubling for Chelsea, he is a player we would perhaps look at maybe removing after this game week. So got to give him this week in my opinion. Wilson a player I would be quite keen to continue on with. Plenty of shots he's still taking, set pieces and the like. Um underperforming creatively, so hopefully he can pick up a few more assists. The Sunderland away game is not perfect necessarily, but I think he is playable in that gameweek and certainly 28-29 against Spurs and West Ham at home. You would be looking to start Wilson in those games. And of course, gameweek 31 where again we are going to be lacking a decent chunk of FPL options. I guess Wilson is going to be facing Burnley in gameweek 31. So, not quite on the screen, guys, but he is going to be one of those uh real useful players to have when the chaos of the season truly begins. So, uh, Wilson must stay. Uh, well, at least he must be considered to stay because I don't think it's an absolute must keep because the fixtures upcoming are not perfect, but certainly strong arguments to keep him, particularly if you can bench him. If you can't really bench him ever, maybe there are some better options, but still Garner. Um, another player who you could maybe sell if you really wanted to. The fixes aren't amazing for Everton, but a player like Garner who is kind of a bit of a defcon beast. maybe not the same as a defcon beast as Anderson. Um, you know, he his fixture it doesn't really matter. He's always going to pick up those Defcon uh well opportunities at least because he's kind of tracking what like four Defcon points hits in the last six gameweeks. I know 93 defcons in six game weeks looks crazy high, but he got like 28 29 in one game, which has really inflated those numbers. So, I think he's fine to stick around, but if you, you know, have an idea of a new midfielder you want to buy and there aren't really any other options on on who to sell, then I think Garner could be sacrificed, particularly as he has lost some set pieces since Juicebury Hall has returned. Declin Rice, I I still think is an okay option. I think really because we have some average fixtures in the next two and we have that guaranteed gameweek 31 blank. I think those are really some strong reasons to maybe think about selling Rice only if you have another midfielder who you really want to bring into your team. I think Rice is absolutely fine to keep. He is, you know, perfectly good to keep but he is sacrificable and I think that is the key point here. Kuna another player who I think is sacrificeable and I think the reason for that is because of some concerns around his minutes. Now, obviously, he has been returning here and there over the last six game weeks, which has been pretty nice for owners, but we're seeing a lot of early substitutes. And with Shesho scoring in gameweek 26, kind of against West Ham, the hero of that game really to recover the unbeaten record under Carrick. I think as such, there is maybe a world in which Kuna is benched for the next game and Shesco plays up front. Now, I can't say that, you know, for a guarantee either way. And even if it doesn't happen in gameweek 27, we're then looking at gameweek 28. will it happen then instead? So I think Kuna is definitely a benching waiting to happen and whether you care about that or you know are worried about that is maybe a personal decision but for me he is another one of those players who falls into the sacrificeable kind of category when we're looking at straight up cells Turkey Foden these guys are just definite cells I mean come on I mean who still has these guys at this point hopefully you don't but if you do um there's so many great midfield options that we're going to talk about today that you can replace these guys with things can get better. But really, the rotation risk combined with the real real lack of performances, you know, one goal and one assist for Churkey and Foden combined over the past six game weeks, it's just not good enough. And Bruno G. Yeah, disappointing news for Bruno G as he has picked up a hamstring injury and he is going to be out for a significant period of time. We're talking like two months that this guy is going to be out for. If you are a Bruno G owner, he is a 100% definite bonafidey cell. In terms of defenders, Chaliba is going to be a keep for this Burnley at home game. He has actually been one of the Defcon masters recently, but maybe that's more to do with Chelsea's poor defensive performances and he's just having to do so much defending perhaps. Um, and you know, maybe some of the ways in which he gets Defcon Gons is kind of interesting. Let's just put it that way. But he's doing him and that gets you FPL points. Now, I think after this game week, the four-pointers that he seems to be picking up maybe could turn into some three-pointers if Chelsea conceded a few more goals against some more difficult oppositions. But in 27 against Burnley, you may be looking at a four-point minimum, assuming he gets his defensive contribution points. Maybe not, maybe not guaranteed. And you know, Burnley do have a annoying knack of getting the odd goal here and there, but I I just can't see a world in which you would sell a nailedon player playing against Burnley at home. So, Chalaba's got to be a keep this week and then next week definitely a player to reassess. Timber, I don't think has to go this week necessarily. Spurs in a transitional period with some with a new management, but I don't think they're suddenly going to find their score their shooting boots. So, Timber I think is going to be fine to keep for 27 and we can maybe start to reassess that one as we get to Chelsea, Brighton and indeed the blank in 31. Mark Gay, another player I wouldn't really be looking to sell this week. I think the next two fixtures are pretty average against Newcastle and Leads, but there are still some good clean sheet opportunities before he is blank in gameweek 31. Um, I can't really see myself selling him to be honest because I think Man City and Gayhei has just been fairly reliable recently and of course he did indeed score as well in the FA Cup. Maybe we could see him get back to his Crystal Palace scoring ways this time in a Man City shirt. Sessi want to monitor. Now the fixtures are great and on paper a Bournemouth defender right now who's you know typically a defcon guy looks great but unfortunately there has been a certain other uh defender who has been eating up all of the defcon at Bournemouth who of course we will be talking about again this week but Sessi he has been falling a little short on defcon over the last two game weeks. I don't think that is necessarily going to continue to happen every single gameweek. I think defcon will be back on the cards for him. He has been a reliable Defcon guy throughout the season and the fixtures are good. So I think things could potentially turn around for him um in the coming game weeks in in kind of a contrast to the last couple of weeks. But um yeah, I guess we do have to monitor him a little bit because if he continues to really really just be mogged by Hill in terms of Defcon, then you know, it's become becomes a little bit more difficult to justify Sessi. I I think the defense is not maybe not as bad as some people make it out to be at Bournemouth right now. And I think in these fixtures there will be a couple of clean sheet opportunities for him and for Bournemouth. It's just about that defcon really. Rehys James is of course always going to be a rotation risk player. But ahead of this Burnley game now we know he's fit and available. I wonder if it is a risk worth taking. I guess that's down to your risk appetite. But Rais James at home against Burnley if he does start in that game and you know not only does he have some some clean sheet potential but also you know being that set piece man set piece taker you're always going to have those additional chances of you know spiking a goal spiking an assist and maybe even getting into bonus if the clean sheets's there as well. I think James is such a high-risisk high reward player but if you still have him in your team and you're happy to continue on with that high-risisk high reward then why not? Collins this is a really interesting one. Now, I asked some Brenford fans uh recently, why isn't Collins playing at the moment? Why hasn't he not started the last three games? And the short answer really is that despite all of his FPL points, he hasn't actually been playing that well. Um certainly in the few games before he was dropped, he wasn't playing that well. And Andrews at Brenford is just a manager who is happy to rotate his defenders based on form. Now, there's every chance Collins comes back into the starting lineup for Brenford, but it's probably going to require one of the other defenders, so Aya or Vandenberg to drop an absolute stinker in a Brenford chair. And if that happens, then maybe Collins comes back in and reclaims his place. We don't know if that's going to happen. We don't know when's that going to happen. It's really difficult to say. So, is he a keep? Is he a cell? I don't know. The good thing is certainly over the last two game weeks is that he whilst he has been benched he hasn't been auto subed on because he hasn't had any minutes played and in that sense maybe there is some argument to say you know start him try him out if he doesn't play then hopefully you've got a backup on the bench but he is definitely a player we do need to keep an eye on if you are a Collins owner hopefully things can turn around hopefully you can get back into the starting 11 and become a really useful asset again because we know he's good for attacking contributions and indeed defcon on. Um, so I would like him to be in the lineup again, but we don't know right now. And, you know, we got to keep an eye on those other Brenford guys and the other Brenford performances. If Brighton, you know, absolutely dominate Brenford, score a couple of goals, the the current center backs drop stinkers. Collins is back in play. So, maybe you can bench Collins this week. Wait and see for next week. Um, yeah. So, that's basically the rundown on Collins. Difficult really to place him because we don't know what's going to happen next. um he could go in either direction in terms of keep or sell um in the next week. So, we'll keep an eye on him. Definitely a monitor. And Kuka um an injury that is likely to see him out for game week 27, but we don't know for 100% sure. It is a hamstring injury, which is usually bad news for a player. Of course, he picked up picked that up uh injury up the other game. If he's back for Burnley or if it looks likely he could be back for Burnley, maybe he's worth keeping. But uh if he is going to be out then yeah just an obvious cell because after that the fixtures are pretty stinky for Chelsea. Cash is going to go in the cell category. Minor injury not sure if he's going to be back for game 27 but just in general with Aston Villa I'm not massively keen on their defenders because they don't get defensive contributions. Cash I think is kind of overrated when it comes to attacking potential. He doesn't really have that much. and clean sheets. Well, yeah, Aston Villa keep a clean sheet maybe one every three games, but over this run of fixtures outside of Wolves, I don't think there's an obvious clean sheet fixture here. I think Leads have a very good chance of scoring and in 29 and 30, Chelsea, Man United away from home. Yeah, surely surely there is going to be better picks to come in uh to have in the coming gameweek. So, I think I would maybe use this opportunity to just sell cash to be totally honest. just not really my kind of pick. But maybe that is some personal bias um when placing him in the cell category. Vanderven um yeah poor fixtures. We don't really know what's going on with the managers. Defcon is not super common and just Spurs have been so bad defensively. I don't think any new manager can suddenly magically resolve that one. And Tarovski, the fixtures are poor, the price is very high, and the defcon has begun to dry up as well. really with with uh Everton defenders. It's only game week 29 where these Everton defenders look even playable. They've got Man United, Newcastle and Arsenal in the next four and they've got some difficult fixtures kind of in game 31, 32. Um really the next seven game weeks are really really rough for them outside of that Burnley game. So yeah, Tarovski at that price, yeah, it's got to be a sell. And guys, we are of course back after a little break from the FA Cup. So, if you wouldn't mind leaving a little like on the video to welcome me back to YouTube after what is it 4 days off, 5 days off, um I would be massively appreciated to help me get back in the algorithm. Do feel free to subscribe as well if you're new. Right, let's check out some players to buy. We spoke about Thiago and Echk already, but you know, I really would be strongly looking at these players as potential buys. Certainly Thiago because the fixtures really are so nice all the way up until a gameweek 32 wild card, but also beyond um as well. So if you're not planning on wild carding in game 32, Thiago serves you really really well um really for the next 67 game week. So um I did the 67 thing again that was accidental but guys Thiago looks really good right now. Days are good on penalties fixtures good everything is pointing in the right direction when we're looking for those FPL picks. a strong consideration to buy um you know if you've got a third forward as well right now who uh is kind of you know like a 4.5 million forward who you know is not going to play uh in gameweek 31 and you just need to have uh in gameweek 31 an additional player in your squad so you can field a full 11 in the blank gameweek. I think upgrading one of your one of your cheap forwards, I guess, to someone like Thiago, it could be really nice. Or if you got a Maray, an Obi, a Mane, even up to someone like Thiago, if that's possible, if you can free up just, you know, a couple of million to make that upgrade, I think it may be well worth doing in preparation for game 31. I think that's the way I'm looking at doing it. But anyway, um, Ekit also still looks really good with really good underlying data, and I think the fixtures are certainly good enough for him as well to go forward and succeed. So, uh, let's see what happens there. Joel Pedro is a really interesting one and finding him really difficult to place right now because on on the one hand, Burnley at home is a fantastic fixture for him. You know, it's the best fixture for him as long as he's starting in that game and there's no guarantee of that happening. I think it's fairly likely though. Um, he is potentially even captain material in gameweek 27. You you have to put him in that category. But after that when the fixtures look rougher, the rotation maybe becomes a little bit more of an issue um suddenly Joel Pedro becomes a problem player. So if you are happy to go for a a shortterm punt with you know maybe you know being aware that you'll live have to sell him or maybe bench him in some of these game you know Arsenal away probably going to bench him maybe you can start him in in 2930 potentially you know if you're comfortable with that then um yeah absolutely go for him. I mean certainly there's not that many options in the forward position right now. So whilst Joel Pedro comes with significant risks you know the alternative is to not just get no points in gameweek 27 but get no points in gameweek 28 29 30 anyway. So uh yeah I think Joel Pedro is is you know one of the better of a bad bunch amazing for 27 but even from 28 onwards is he really that much worse than a lot of the other options even in these really difficult fixtures? Probably not. So yeah, could be considered as a buy after that. It's pretty rough out there. I mean, I've got Strand Lawson in here. Very likely 95% chance of a blank in gameweek 31. So that's not looking good. Um but he looked good first game in a Crystal Palace shirt. Uh well actually second technically. Um yeah, looked reasonably impressive I I think. So, uh, Wolves at home is a good fixture as we well know. If he is, you know, starting in that game again, which we we see no reason why he wouldn't be and he can continue his performance and really get his confidence back, we know he's a good player. So, you know, maybe this could be pretty good. I think Man United away is not an ideal fixture, but I think he's perfectly playable in that game week and 2930, I think these are definitely weeks in which you would look to start him as well. So yeah, he does blank in 31 most likely, but I think you can get some use out of him between now and then, particularly at 6.1 million. So if you've got a few free transfers, you know, in the bank, you're happy to take short-term punts. Players like Joel Pedro, players like Strand Lson, I think could be reasonably useful for you, but they're not going to be for everyone. If you're kind of lacking transfers and already foreseeing some problems in 31, maybe you're less likely to go for some of these guys. So yeah, horses for courses and all of that. Watkins also in here. one to monitor. We need to see his performances improve, but there are some okay fixtures in here for him. Um, particularly 27, 28, and 31. Creeper Jr., you could potentially look at him. We know Bournemouth have some nice fixtures coming up. He was rested in gameweek 26, but I think he should come back into the starting 11 in gameweek 27 where there should be more opportunities. He's one of those players who just, you know, scores one goal every four or five gameweeks and blanks the rest of the time. If that's your kind of player, then why not? Bowen, not really sure I'd be looking at him as much to be honest. Bournemouth at home, not such a bad fixture, but the next three not so keen on for West Ham. Actually, the next four I'm not so keen on as well because we do have Aston Villa in game 31 for West Ham. And avoid Calbert Lewin. Pretty weird time to buy him away against Villa at home against Man City. Probably can wait a couple more weeks before going in on the lead striker. Shesho. I think there's just too much rotation risk there to go for him. I mean, he just simply has not been starting for Manchester United, and I don't think it's worth taking a risk that he will suddenly start. I mean, it's definitely possible, but you know, like we kind of mentioned with Kuna earlier in the video, Shesho starts in game at 27. Fine. There's no guarantee he then starts in game at 28, 29, or indeed 30. So, you're playing with fire every week, and not really my favorite thing to play with fire. Uh, prefer to play with ice, uh, snowmen and all that. Much more fun. Yarez, uh, we've got him next. Yeah, his usefulness as a double gameweek punt is kind of expended now. Blanking in gameweek 31. The next few fixtures are not particularly amazing necessarily. So, uh yeah, he is definitely not going to be a player I would recommend buying right now. In midfield, there's loads of options. Bruno continues to be a really really solid buy, but I imagine most of you guys have him already in your team. Florian verts if not is probably going to be the next option kind of alongside who isn't in this video but um yeah I kind of put in the sim similar category to Vertz as in kind of a mid8 million kind of price tag who is reasonably reliable good data the kind of player we like the look of so yeah Vert if you can't go for Ecat or you don't have ETK and you want some Liverpool attack coverage I certainly do like the look of Vertz maybe gameweek 27 is a little early but certainly from gameweek 28 I think he is right back in contention is going to be a really nice pick. the form has just been so much better from him and I think um I think he can really get some of those you you know you know those really big scores you know those halls those monster scores and he's got a couple of them in his locker in the upcoming game but if you do want to go a bit cheaper with your picks Dango is back man like the fixtures look really good for him the performances has been good he looks like he's in good form right now he is a differential not too many people have him in their team and I just think this could be the punt to go for right now if you were looking to go cheap um He runs you all the way until like gameweek 3233 in terms of good fixtures that just keep coming and coming and coming. Um, have I sold him to you yet? Maybe. Uh, yeah, he looks like the pick if you're going a little bit cheaper. Although, I'm not sure I would double up on Thiago. Maybe for those of you guys who aren't going for Thiago or who don't have Thiago and want to find a midfield route into the Brenford attack, Dango would be the guy to go for. Not to say a double up is necessarily bad, but uh yeah, certainly I'd be more likely to go for Dango if I wasn't going for Thiago. Rogers wants a monitor. Certainly a player to consider buying for this game week with the good fixtures in the the next two and the good fixture in 31. Um taking plenty of shots as we know and creating a little bit as well. But as always, Roger's underlying numbers, they're not particularly uh amazing. Palmer's going to be a really interesting one because he is to me the best captain for Game 27. Um, let's be totally real. Um, players like Jo Pedro, players like Palmer, they have been they have been pretty lucky. Let's put it that way in the last two game weeks. I mean, three penalties all won by Joel Pedro. Two of them because the opposing player just randomly decided to shove Joel Pedro over in the box. I mean, it's not going to happen every single game week, right? We think, but you know, recent trends suggest that Chelsea are picking up a lot of penalties. But I think we have to be, you know, admit that some have been more fortunate than others. Um, Palmer of course with all of those penalty goals, that's been great. 5.1 xG looks amazing, but when you factor in those penalties and the fact that he missed a very much an open goal in gameweek 26, you kind of understand why these numbers are so high. Um, so, you know, take them with context a little bit, but for gameweek 27 in isolation, he looks like the best captain to me. And I think that's pretty straightforward. And I think most people will probably agree with that one as well. But beyond that, he is a very expensive asset to have uh a really difficult run of fixtures because really from gameweek 28, Chelsea have the worst fixtures in the Premier League. No team has fixtures that are worse. So if you have a few transfers spare, you're happy to do the inout hoke koke with Cole Palmer, then yeah, fine. For the sake of getting captaincy, do it. But he comes with, you know, uh he basically costs two transfers is is what I'm saying. probably going to cost you two transfers because I don't imagine you would be as keen on owning him in some of the more difficult fixtures. So is a similar situation where if you have a lot of free transfers, he is a player you could potentially go for because of that blank in gameweek 31. So if you're happy to pick up another blanking player with the uh with the knowledge that you'll have to use another transfer to remove him in gameweek 31. And I know some people will say, \"Well, Dan, I'm just going to free hit in game 31.\" I don't have to worry about that. Wait until the next video. Make sure you subscribed, guys. Make sure you got notifications on because when you watch the next video, I'm pretty convinced you guys are going to be totally against free hitting in gameweek 31. But you'll have to wait for that video to find out why that is in uh more detail. But let's just put it this way. If you think you you're going to have a few players blanking in gameweek 31, yeah, wait until you hear about gameweek 34. Anyway, guys, we have got uh Semeno here as a potential buy only if you have loads of spare transfers to do a hokeie koke. We got a risky player here, Ryan. Um, not really enough data, certainly not enough long-term data in the Premier League to really get an idea on how good he's going to be, but he looks very good so far. I've watched a lot of Bournemouth recently and Ryan looks fabulous and the fixtures are good. He's just 5.5 million. Could be a risk worth taking. He could be a Semeno regen in this Bournemouth size. A really interesting pick, but he is seriously risky because he is so new to the league. Avoid Somerville. The former has been good but the fixtures beyond well even game meet 27 I don't think is a the perfect fixture against Bournemouth um yeah the fixtures the fixtures are just not there the over performance has been um significant but the form has been there so um I just can't really see myself going for someone like over Ryan and Dango who have also been in good form but have significantly better fixtures and play for significantly better teams as well you would probably say Enzo is not like Joel Pedro is not like Palmer because Enzo I don't think is as captainable in in gameweek 27. So the upside isn't really there um in gameweek 27 in isolation and really gameweek 28 29 30 31 32 um rubbish for Chelsea. Really really rubbish. So uh why pick up an extra Chelsea player with such terrible fixtures if you're not even going to captain him in game 27 because really if you're buying Chelsea players I would want them to be captain material at the very least and I'm not sure Enzo is that guy. So line not really a player I'd be looking to pick up uh either. H surely the the uh free kick and corner goals and assists aren't going to necessarily continue. I just think there are just better options at 6.7 million in the game of FPL right now. As for your defenders, Gabrielle is going to continue to be the most essential defender in in the whole game, right? Uh Hill continues to perform. I mean we speak about him pretty frequently over the last few few game weeks. We're kind of early adopters on Hill on the FPL Mate YouTube channel, but uh yeah, certainly he's looking good. I think maybe a little fortunate with the quantity of assists that he's had recently, but in terms of defensive contributions right now, no defender is doing better than him in the entire league. So, um he is top with with that in mind. The fixtures are good and there will be some clean sheets in here. Don't know how many, but there will be some. Um, but when you're getting Defcon every week, you have some kind of uh assist potential, whether that's from set pieces or, you know, throwins. He's like the main throwin taker or he'll or just passing a sideways pass to Ryan who's going to run up the whole pitch. Then, you know, we take it all. And for 4 million, so cheap. So, so cheap. Uh, there is no little really to talk about Hill against him other than maybe West Ham away is not the best fixture in the world at the moment where with West Ham kind of looking okay at the moment. Um, but certainly beyond that, Hill is is, you know, he's playable in every single game because of the Defcon. Virgil also a player to buy if you want to go a little bit more expensive. I think from a defensive perspective, this run of fixtures for Liverpool is really nice actually. Forest great fixture for a defender. Spurs, great fixture for a defender in West Ham. The Wolves are pretty good fixtures generally speaking. So, um, as such, Virgil I would be more than happy to pick up right now if I didn't have him already. And that is not me overreacting to the goal he scored last game week. Um, it's going to happen sometimes. I try not to judge players based on goals randomly scored. Um, but you know, it's so he's so much more than that right now. Uh, he's getting Defcon as well finally as well, which is good. So, lots to like lots to like about Virgil Mukle. Uh, the fixtures are back for Sunderland. So, you can definitely go in on him if you don't have him in your squad right now. Munoz high upside but does have that blank in gameweek 31. There is some potential there. Now, obviously, we spoke about Brenford and the rotation risk of pretty much all of their center backs right now. So, if you're unwilling to go for a Brenford center back, maybe you could go for Coyote. Doesn't really offer much in defensive contributions. Have a has a little bit of attacking threat, but nothing special. But the fixtures are good. The fixtures are good. And he will he'll get Defcon occasionally. He'll get an attacking return occasionally. And he's 4.5 million. So, maybe that's the route. Or maybe you could take a risk on someone like Aya at center back who I believe is 4.4 4 million. Mark Ghee, not sure I would necessarily buy him right now just because of that game 31 blank, but maybe a player to consider to consider to consider and Sessi is going to be an avoid. I mean, if you're going for one of him and Hill, Hill is the guy, right? And and until we see what's going on with Sessi's defcons in the long term, it's difficult to suggest buying him. Of course, you may keep him if you already have him, but if you're going for a Bournemouth defender right now, Hill is your guy. Hill is your guy. and I will die on that hill. Chalaba is in here as an avoid as well for a four-pointer against Burnley, which is probably what's going to happen. Um, is it worth the transfer considering the rubbish fixtures after that? And Malik Chow, goalcoring game at 26 after I sold him. I'm sure a few of you guys feel that pain, but the fixtures are just really bad for Newcastle as well. In terms of goalkeepers, keep Rya, keep Sanchez if you already have these guys. They got a good fixture in game 27 each. Um, I would definitely sell cells. Uh, but Pigford is maybe a sell as well because of the difficult runner fixtures and indeed the high price tag. So, might be worth selling if you want to if you've got no other priorities in your squad. If you're looking for a new goalkeeper, Keller would be the player I would buy for sure. Good fixtures for Brenford coming up. An easy and safe way into that Brenford defense with some save potential there as well. Particularly uh penalty saves could be uh a thing that Keller maybe specializes in. could get you some points that way. Martinez um probably one of the better ways into the Aston Villa defense in my opinion because you don't have to rely on defcon and he does get saves. And in terms of avoiding players, just those players who blank in gaming 31, Rya, Donaruma, these players are going to cause you problems in gameweek 31. So to buy them, I think would be a bad idea, particularly considering those who already own these players will maybe be looking to sell them in the near future. Although to be honest, if you've got Dravka as a backup, he's probably going to do the job in gameweek 31. But uh why put yourself in that position if you don't have to if you don't already have these players in your squad. But that's all of the players I'm going to talk about today. If there's anyone I missed out, let me know in the comments section and I will give them a rating by sell or avoid. Keep the discussion going, guys. Uh we love to talk about FBL here. I missed it a little bit, but we are now back for the new game week. Thank you for watching. Do leave a like. Do subscribe if you haven't done already. and I will see you on the next video, which is going to be a mega one. It's going to be all about double and blank gameweeks and the new information we have on those. Stay tuned and I'll see you later, mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "in the air. Yeah. Thank you. Woo! Heat. Heat. Well, well, well. Hello. Hello. One and all. It's It's almost time, guys. I've put the Arsenal shirt on because it's like an Arsenal kind of day. Well, Arsenal Arsenal kind of day. We've got to wait until Thursday. That's the one annoying thing about the uh double game week, isn't it? that it doesn't really begin until all the way on Thursday and then we got to wait again until uh Tuesday. Um but anyway guys, hello. Welcome to FPL mate. My name is Dan. It is double game week time. It's double game week time. I'm just putting out a tweet about the fact that we're streaming so just bear with me. Um someone says, \"Is the FPL site down?\" Not that I'm aware of. Um not that I'm aware of. I mean, I'm I'm logged onto it right now, so I think it's fine. Uh, the graphic is wrong. Arsenal can't play on the same day. What do you mean my graphic's wrong? I messed up. Oh, that should say, sorry, that should say Tuesday the I don't even know what day. Uh, Tuesday the 18th. Okay, hold on. Let me just update that real quick. Well spotted. Well spotted. Tuesday the 18th. You know, I thought I'd start streaming a little bit earlier today, but actually maybe I just should have spent an extra 15 minutes just ensuring all of the uh graphics are correct. Maybe that would have been a good idea. Anyway, guys, just fixing that now and it should be updated momentarily. But how is everyone doing regardless? Um members, let me know if you're here. Um, and I will say hello to all of you. Um, let's just put this tweet out. And then and then here we go. Right. Oh, we got a super chat already. Right. Okay. Which members have we got here? Carl is here. Uh Trash Pan is here. Max is here. Mark is here. Welcome guys. Welcome guys. And we got a super chat already uh from uh Yugen Raj who says, \"I can't afford Rice nor Timber for my third slot. Should I go Zuba Mendy? I need to replace Wilson.\" I think first of all, I don't think you do need to replace Wilson. Um Wilson's actually a player I'm looking at potentially buying. He has a game against Burnley in gameweek 31. um which is he's he's probably one of the best picks for blank gameweek 31. So I actually quite like Wilson. Would not be looking to um to kind of remove him to be honest. Um if you can't afford Rice or Timber, I think Celiba or you know if you got Rya already, I'm not sure. Um I'd maybe look to go there or I don't know man. I just think Zuba Mendy it doesn't fill me with inspiration. Um, I appreciate he has scored a fair amount of FPL points this season, but I think that's because availability has been his best ability this season more than anything. And he scored a couple of banger goals. I just, particularly as an Arsenal fan, I just don't know. It's the 17th. What's the Wednesday the 18th is when that uh Why are people saying 17th? Maybe it's a time zone thing. Um, so yeah. Um, I just I'm not I'm not at all inspired by the the Zub Mendy pick and I know so many people are so keen on um on him. Sorry, it's Wednesday the 18th. That's why that's why I'm getting wrong. It's Wednesday the 18th, not Tuesday. We will get this right eventually. The Wolves Arsenal game. So, it's definitely the 18th. We just got the day of the week wrong. Well, we're getting there eventually. We're getting there eventually. Right, there we go. Um, right, we've got uh we've got stuff to talk about today outside of Super Mendy because I just I don't know. I just cannot cannot get my head around the selling Zub Mendy. I sorry, buying Zub Mendy or selling Wilson really. Um, so I don't really know how to answer that without seeing a full team. It's difficult to say what your kind of other options are, but I would I would say that Zuba Mendy is like kind of very low priority. I mean that I if I was to rank Arsenal picks right now, I guess I would say number one Gabrielle, number two probably Rice, then Timber, then Rya, then Celiba, then Yarez. So at best, Zuma Mendi is the seventh best Arsenal pick in my opinion of course and you know on a double game week for a good team like Arsenal, do we really want the seventh best Arsenal pick? Few few questions around Califuri as well. Um I wasn't totally convinced by him uh in gameweek 25. Um, and also he's just come back from injury. So given that it's a kind of a Thursday game this week, I wonder if he could be rotation risk. I just I don't think I'd be willing to take the risk there. I don't think the upside is high enough there to um to really be worth going for. So yeah, not super keen on on the Califury pick either. So there are a lot of rogue picks and obviously look if you feel strongly about certain players then you should absolutely go for them but all I can really do here is uh kind of give my opinion. Uh got a super chat here from collage fen says one free transfer O'Reilly to uh will be able to manage gamew. Yeah, you definitely could do. But to be honest, if you if you have a feeling that O'Reilly will play against Fulham at home this week, I don't think it's such a bad fixture to have him. I don't think he's so bad. So, I think, you know, it's it's an improvement on the team, but um I don't think it's an essential move necessarily. I think it's an essential move. Um I still need to um make my transfers, by the way. Uh any team conference, press conference news? Um, yeah, not really too much interesting stuff. And I thought because we're streaming a little early today, we could just go through it together. Um, if you want and we'll kind of answer some questions, genu general FBL questions whilst we kind of do this on the side. Um, so uh yeah, we'll go through some of the press conference news um as well. And uh what we'll do is uh yeah, I there just wasn't too much interesting stuff. I'll put it that way. There was some press conferences yesterday. Uh there's some more today. I don't think we're getting an Arsenal press conference, unfortunately. So, I know a few of you guys may be wondering about like is Saka going to be back? Is he going to damage the, you know, like um like Maw's minutes? What's the Trosard situation? Yeah, unfortunately, uh it is just going to be a case of hoping for the best and picking safely. picking safely, picking sensibly, um I think is probably the wise move as well. Um but in terms of team news, the uh the biggest headline I guess some people I know are looking at Strand Lson. Um Mateta isn't going to need surgery, but Mateta is going to be out for it looks like weeks. So we can certainly consider that team news, I suppose. Uh, in fact, I'm going to just go ahead and start writing some notes here. So, Mateta will not have surgery, but is out for weeks, weeks at least, it looks like. Um, Trayori and oh, sorry, Grant Jaca still out as well, just in case anyone still has him. Um, West Ham apparently have some injuries, but there's no clear idea on what those injuries are. Nuno's kind of kept that a bit secret. Have some um secret injuries from West Ham. Um, oh, Bournemouth. Bournemouth from a press conference from Bournemouth. Bournemouth are going to rotate a little bit apparently. Don't know who, but maybe worries me a little bit about Hill. Um although maybe it should worry Sessi is just as much because Hill is playing very well at the moment. Bournemouth are expected to rotate a bit and uh I don't really know what else was particularly interesting um to be honest. Uh oh, John Stones is back. Uh he was training last last week. Uh and and Kusenov's available as well following his little issue last week. So Kusenov are available. I don't know if that worries uh Mark Gayhei owners at all. Um maybe it should. Uh would you start creepy then? I guess off the back of the Bournemouth thing. Um, it's got to be something to worry about a little bit, but I think mostly the the form of rotation was kind of hinted at because of fatigue. And given that Krooppy is kind of getting pretty early subs every game, he he's probably not one of the players who is probably most in danger of of uh having a a fatigue related benching if that makes sense. So, he's probably just going to play another uh 60 minutes. Hi, Dan. team is Reya De Bravka, Gabrielle Alati Hill, Roland Collins, and Burmo, Bruno Rogers, Wilson, next DK Harland. You is a third Arsenal slot necessary? I think a third Arsenal pick is going to be necessary. Yeah. Um how you go about that, I'm not exactly sure. Um depends how much money you have in the bank. I guess a defender could come in if you can afford to get to Timber or Celiba. Um, not really sure how you're going to get Declan Rice in. You could maybe do Ech to Jockarez as well. Um, if not, is is Rogers to Is Rogers to Rice the one? I don't know. Maybe maybe. But so so you do have some options there. Um, but I would I would do it. I would get that third Arsenal guy. Sir, with the super chat here says, \"Have five free transfers but cannot afford Minor in one move. I can do ciao to Laqua. Uh or should I downgrade Pigford? I mean, you could do um you could do Chiao to be fair, I don't really see the benefit of going for Laqua over Richards given that there is a bit of a price gap there. So, I would go for Richards, sure, over over Laqua, I think. Um yeah, as long as you got your three Arsenal settled, I don't think you need to go too crazy with the transfers. or if you do really want Munoz, make two transfers. If you've got, you say you're open to downgrading Pikford, I'm not exactly sure where I would go to from Pikford. Um, so that's kind of a difficult one. I'm like, who even are the good goalkeepers? I guess Keller from next week looks pretty good. Um, but you probably not the best jumping on point now. Or or to be fair, you could do pick for to Kellaher now and um play to Brava this week potentially as well. That's going to be a possibility. Um that's probably the best I can think of off the top of my head. Really struggling with goalkeepers at the moment to be honest. So difficult to pick them out. Uh Matias says, \"Mr. Deadline on Friday. Was sick in bed. I know it's a huge ask, but if you could look over my team uploaded earlier today to the G Drive.\" Yes, Matias, I will look at your team and any other uh starting 11 tier members. If you just pop your team in the in the Google Drive, I will have a look at it um whilst we've got time sort of in the next hour. Well, within the next hour, I mean. Uh Abdul with the super chat here says Casemiro or Ghana trying to replace Subs? No, neither really. Um, if you're replacing Sasly, I would say that the obvious move is probably is Milasar. I would say not really sure who else I'd really go for in that kind of price bracket. I mean, unless you just you want to go you want to go really cheap and you want to go for like a Anderson or something. Well, not really cheap, but pretty cheap. Anderson, Jupy Hall potential. there is potential there. So that's kind of uh maybe where I'd be looking to go retreat cheap midfielder, but it's minus first of all and that should be affordable, right? So lie to let's see I'm I've not actually owned Soai at all this season, so I don't actually know for sure how much he is. Um but I'm guessing like around 6.5, right? 6.7. Okay. Okay. Well, yeah, that's a pretty simple switch there. And SAR is what? 6.3. Yeah. So, yeah, that's going to be a pretty easy move. If if you're replacing subs, then SAR, unless you're trying to free up a bit of money, in which case I'd just go to Anderson. I think Anderson is just, you know, Mr. Reliable at this point. Um, a pretty a pretty simple one. All in all, Mark says, \"At top 100k rank, if I just captain Gabrielle, if he returns, does it hurt my rank?\" I don't know. I don't know yet. Um, I mean, we can get an idea in the chat of how many people will be triple captaining this week. So, um, are you using the triple captain ship this game week? Uh, and I'll put yes on um yes on Gabrielle, yes on Rice, yes on someone else. And just no is the other answer I suppose. So we get a rough idea on not just how many people are triple captaining, but also where those chips are going. Um, but I have my trouble captain on right now. It's It's activated. It's activated. Has been for a couple of days now. Why not just keep So I mean, you could if you wanted to. Um, I just think there are probably better options out there right now. Um, to be honest, I mean, I'm going to be making some midfield I'm probably going to make two midfield transfers in the next couple of game weeks. Subs is not really even making top 10 for me. There's just I think our our standard our expectations from midfielders just needs to be really high at the moment and because just because there are so many incredible options. There's so many midfielders I want and I know I'm not going to be able to get all of them. It's so frustrating. I want Wilson. I want Ryan. I want Atara. I want Vets. Um and some other guys as well. Rogers. I'd like to have Rogers. How am I going to get all of these guys in my team? I'm simply not. I'm simply not. So, probably looking at selling Rice soon. Probably looking at selling Enzo soon. I mean, maybe in Burmo, but I mean, there's no strong reason to selling Burma right now. It's tough. It's tough. And I've got to upgrade Obi as well at some point. Ready for Gameweek 31. Max said, \"How many gameweek 31 non-players would it take to dissuade you from Tarovski to Minos? I have triple Harland and triple Arsenal, triple Arsenal, Harland, and Gu.\" Uh, non-playing players, how many I mean, if you only have triple Arsenal and Harland and Gu, you're in the same situation as me pretty much. So, I have Obi instead of Gu. And I'm bringing in a new Crystal Palace player this week and it's going to be fine. So, yeah. I it helps when one of your Arsenal players is Rya to be fair. That does genuinely help, but um yeah, I think you should be okay to go for one more. The Australia with a super chat the eur a super chat in Euros despite being called Australia. Uh says, \"Hi Dan, on the fence about triple captain Gabrielle. Do you think there will be better any better double game weeks later in the season? Head is melted.\" Yeah, we've done a lot of content around that this week to be honest. the Australia, but I'm happy to whiz through it quickly for you today. So, uh, I have here my Dublin blank gameweek spreadsheet and I think probably this is the best area to focus on to start off with. So, um, really we've got a double game week 26. We know that's happening. That's sorted. we're going to get a double game week in 33 which almost certainly almost certainly um is going to be a double game week like I'm 99.9% sure there is going to be some double gameweek fixtures in 33 and it should be the biggest double gameweek of the season and therefore unless you've already bench boosted or are planning on bench boosting before gameweek 33 gameweek 33 just looks like such an obvious um bench boost week, particularly if there are a lot of double game weeks, which we have high potential for. There's to be a lot of double game weeks because of the way everything has landed. So, yeah, it's going to be um it's going to be an interesting one. Uh it's going to be the biggest double game week of the season, no matter how we frame it. And uh yeah, that is just that's just your bench boost week or you know, maybe a free hit week. you know, you could maybe spin it and be a free hit week, but unless you've already used some of your chips, um it's unlikely to be a triple captain week, but if you have used some of your chips or you are going to kind of splurge a few of them early, which want to go on record and say I don't recommend, um then gameweek 33 could in that those unique circumstances be a be a triple captain opportunity, but want to try and avoid it really. Gameweek 36 is the next opportunity and I think it looks reasonably likely that uh Man City will have a double gameweek there. As long as Man City reach the or or Burnley, Man City or Burnley, if one of those two teams reaches the FA Cup semi-final, it looks pretty likely that Man City will have a second double gameweek in gameweek 36. And that would be your prime candidate for a second opportunity uh for the triple captain. So it would be in gameweek 36 it would be Brent it would be Man City against Brenford at home and either Crystal Palace at home or Burnley away. I'm really stuck between which one it will be and I guess it depends on some other things that that happen over the next kind of few weeks maybe even week uh because we've got FA Cup games this weekend which is going to really help to narrow things down but that doesn't help us right now when we're trying to when we're hovering over the triple captain button right now. um you know whatever happens this weekend is not useful to us. So realistic expectations gameweek 36 um there are is some potential for a gameweek 37 double gameweek some niche scenarios but it is still so open in that regard so many things need to happen in a certain way in cup um European games in FA Cup games certain teams need to go through etc etc that I don't really think it's worth talking about too much and even so I still think there's a good chance that fixtures just move into gameweek 26. So, in short, what are the alternative triple captain weeks aside from gameweek 26? You could do gameweek 33, but I would rather use a different ship there. A different ship would be far more powerful there. In gameweek 36 looks like the next best opportunity in terms of single game weeks, there's not really much going on to be honest. Um, not really seeing a particular week that stands out for Harland, for example. Um, you know, there's there's is there anything for Bruno? Not really. Leads at home in 32 maybe if you're not wild card in 32 if as a single game week. I don't know. I don't know, man. Not really seeing single game week opportunities to be honest. So, uh, yeah, I'm going to I'm going to basically say triple captain now. The next opportunity is probably going to be game 86. So, there we go. Um, hopefully that helps. Um, but, you know, if it helps, I'm triple captioning now because there's just too many variables for gameweek 36. The double is not guaranteed. It's just the most likely this it's just the second most uh likely opportunity after gameweek 26. Um because I think gaming 33 is a is a non- opportunity. I think it's a hindrance. I don't know. Maybe that helps. Maybe that helps. Uh Chris says, \"Rice and vanventa, Timbar, Triple Captain, and Sar.\" No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Um you Yeah, Rice is fine. Can we not just move Vanerven in this, you know, just one transfer for Vaneran to know Richards Manurs Hill, Sessi, someone like that? That's probably what I would do. I mean, unless you really really want to triple captain Timber, but if you've got Gabrielle and you've got Rice, I'm not as keen on Rice really, but if you've got Gabrielle and you want to triple captain him, then I think that's probably the move. Abdul says minus four to replace Kat Lewin with Mane from Wolves. No, don't think I'd do it. I think honestly Mane probably gets a four-pointer this weekend. This this game week and best scenario really for Mane is like a seven pointer maybe if he can manage an assist. Maybe a little speculative. Rei says Timberle captain. Have I lost it entirely? It's up to you. Do you do you like Timber Gabrielle is the question. Um I don't. I don't. I prefer Gabrielle, but you know there's nobody's saying that Timber is a bad pick. Nobody's saying Timber is a bad pick. He's just a different pick to Gabrielle. Gabrielle ultimately has been the you know primary primary goal scorer out of the defenders are the best defconer the most nailed on for minutes and there's and there's just so and and bonus points does well for bonus points doesn't really get yellow cards. There's just so many points in the favor of Gabrielle versus Timber. What Timber does have is slightly better underlying numbers and maybe slightly better open play positioning or much better open play positioning, but he's so far not really managed to convert that because I don't think he's a particularly good finisher necessarily. Um, so there are more points in the favor of of Gabrielle Gabrielle, but Timber is still a good pick. If you genuinely prefer Timber to Gabrielle or indeed you don't have Gabrielle, um then you definitely could too. Definitely could. Sean says, \"Dan, which one will you bench? Uh Mane, Pedro, or Enzo?\" Well, you're definitely not going to bench uh Pedro or Enzo. So, you got to bench Mané. You can't bench your Chelsea players this week, unfortunately. Leads at home. It's uh the fixture is too good. Uh, Javy says, \"Play Tarovski or Mane or transfer to Minor.\" H um, what would I do there? Probably transfer to Menurs. I'd probably transfer to Minor if I'm honest. But that is a little luxury of a move. There's a little luxury. Stuart asks about news on Sacka. None. Unfortunately, the Arsenal press conference is not until after the FPL deadline, so we won't get an update there, unfortunately. Would you take a hit to sell Tarovski and get? No. No, I wouldn't. Burma injured. Um, I think he's going to be fine. I think he's going to be fine. He's trained. So, are you doing Shouted Riches before deadline? I am indeed. I haven't done it yet. Um to be honest, um I was waiting for Crystal Palace press conference, but that's all done now. Um and it looks like it's the same players are going to be available from last week to this new gameweek. Um the only thing I was kind of w wondering about is is Brenford and Collins. I don't actually know when the Brenford press conference is. Was it yesterday? Does anyone know when the press when the Brenford press conference was? I'm not sure. Or is it not happening until after the deadline? I've not seen any notes anywhere though and I'm not seeing it come up my usual feeds today unless it's unless it's this afternoon. That's the only other thing. Uh, right. What else we got here? Uh, I'm not in the habit of watching Everton games. Where has this Tarovski falloff come from? I mean, I think maybe a a slight switch in tactics um has meant that Tarovski is getting less defensive contributions and we've seen that last couple of game weeks with kind of more center backs on the pitch kind of thing. Um, but I think the main thing is the clean sheets have dried up, right? And with Everton, they were a team and you know this is something that we we kind have spoken about in videos. Um Everton have not looked good defensively for quite some time now. And you know they've been quite fortunate in a lot of the clean sheets that they they were kind of keeping um a few weeks back I suppose now when now that the kind of um the luck has or the good fortune has dried up. Well, we're back to normal and they're conceding goals in situations where yeah, they're kind of expected to concede goals. They're conceding a lot of chances. Of course, they're going to concede goals. It was strange when they weren't conceding goals. And now things are kind of getting back to normal. So, I don't think it's a falloff, but more so things are just regressing to mean a little bit and looking a bit a little bit more how we would expect from a kind of data perspective. So yeah, Everton just not that good of a defense and now it's kind of showing unfortunately. Do I just need to make this transfer now so people stop asking me about when I'm why I haven't done ciao to riches and what I'm doing there? I just wanted to just wait and see if there's there's um anything on Collins. Is there anything? Let's just Google it. Brenford Press conference. Right. When is the next one? Um, there's none available to look at right now. I don't know. I don't know. There we go. Tim, I only answer this question if you put in as a super chat. Uh, hi mate. Tim here is is top 10k ranked good. Triple captain Gabrielle. Good luck on your triple captain Gabrielle. Tim has been top 10k every week for his entire FPL career. Apparently, he's an impressive run in the top 10k. I wonder if he'll ever push on to some higher ranks or just kind of stay around top 10k. Have to wait and see. We'll have to wait and see. VJ with the super chat here says Rya Timber, Taroski, Richards, Anderson, Muki, Bruno Wilson, Rice, Enzo, Chucky, Harland, Watkins, Guers, 3 million in the bank. Shall I remove Cherokee, Taroski or Watkins or Ro maybe bring in Hill Rogers, Echk? I mean, I wouldn't sell Rock Watkins. I think he's fine to keep and indeed play uh this game week. Um, what you may be looking at, you may be looking at Cherokee to someone. Turkey to Vert. Turkey tombmo. Turkey to Sar. I think that's probably what I'd do. Or Turkey to Rogers. You mentioned Rogers as a player you like as well. Um, yeah. I I don't I don't know which which player you prefer out of those, but I think yeah, Churkey would be the move I would make out of those. And that should really help to improve your midfield there. I think Turkey is just just frustrating, isn't he? Just a frustrating FBO asset. And look, there's every chance he starts against Fulham and and scores and whatever, but like is it worth the risk? Is it worth the stress? Is it worth the drama every single game week? Probably not, right? So, I think that's what I would do. Just get it done. Get a player you're confident in and move on. Um, I'd be less keen to bring in Minos or someone like that because you already have Richards. could go for Hill potentially if you want to as well or Sessi. Um maybe save some money to upgrade Gu even to Thiago next game week. That's what I'm looking to do next week maybe or maybe the week after, but probably next week I'm going to be doing Chidowobi to Thiago. Looking forward to that one. So there you go. Those are some suggestions. Belinda says, \"Hey, Thiago versus Anderson. Uh, I'm as an Arsenal lover, um, I'm going to go Anderson over Thiago this week. The only, um, kind of reason to maybe go for Thiago is to kind of hedge against your Arsenal defenders and kind of treat it as a, you know, a win-win scenario. That doesn't really work like that necessarily. So, there we go. Um, I would play Anderson, but yeah, could hedge. Could potentially hedge, right? What else we got here? Uh, bench list. We'll do bench list um at the hour mark. So, we'll start that off at 5. I like to start the bench list an hour before uh deadline just to just so we can uh do whatever else we need to do first. Um, triple captain Rice thoughts. I mean, it's not something I would do. If I didn't have Gabrielle, the triple captain, I would probably just save my triple captain. If it's me, if it's my team, at least. So, there we go. Um, right. Uh, let's do some members team ratings. Now, I can't promise I'm going to do all of them, to be honest, because, uh, yeah, tight deadlines, deadline stream. We'll do our best. We'll do we'll do a few. Um this was uh this is coming this morning. What's the what's the note here? Trying to mimic your team as much as possible. Don't I'm going to go ahead and say don't try and do that necessarily. Um I I one it's not fun um to copy you know someone else's team but uh also you shouldn't tie your your value to mine. You want to go for your own achievements, right? Um but yeah, sacker to rice seems obvious. So yeah, that does help get your team more towards mine. Um yeah, how many free transfer did you say? I don't know how if you miss last deadline I guess you have two free transfers. So Saka Rice Bow into I'd probably do Vitz or Rogers. Um you could do Burma as well if you really did want to get your team close to mine. Um yeah, something like that. Something like that. again that that probably just brings your team closer to mine to be honest. Um but yeah, that's what I would do. Saka Foden, those are your priority transfers out. Chiao could could probably go as well. Um Thiago, if you can create a scenario where you bench Thiago, good, but I don't think that's going to be possible depending on how many transfers you have. Super chat from Sid Vicious have 3.3 million by Manurs for Van Heeka or Tarovski. uh Tarovski I think just cuz you save yourself a bit of money and if Van Hecka's back or if he can return then it's not a bad fixture this week right so who are Brighton playing they're playing never look at Brighton fixtures because I just have zero interest in them uh for my own FPL team away okay yeah maybe not um it was last week they had the nice fixture wasn't Uh so right this is K's team my Everton players need to go soon even with Bourne for home I will be benching one and giant given their fixtures uh a short-term ple or SARS tempting not both I would then get Hill or Anderson or some some of the other guys in gameweek 27 for the other Everton players give me six transfers left gameweek 31 to need to get needing four to get a playing 11 I have exact money to swap my Everton duo to Hill and Burmo or could get vert instead. Um, third option is to do gear to Thiago and game 27. Finding out would mean I get Hill and Jupiter Hall or Anderson. If Daros, I'll probably roll on 26 and do 27. Uh, yeah, I think getting you up to a Thiago is probably your priority. Maybe just cuz it solves an issue in gaming 31. So maybe I would prepare to do that. I mean, this team ultimately doesn't really need any transfers. So I wouldn't rush them in. You mean you've got Laqua, so I don't think you really need Munoz and Saw. Um, you say you got a Bench and Everton player. Maybe make that Tarovski and play in Jai. That's probably what I would do. Yeah, this team this team is a roll. Reevaluate next week. Got Scott's team here. Um, who likes to look at the team? Just wondering what goalkeeper to start really. Um, would I would I play would I play Dravkar over Bugen? I don't know that I would, you know. It's tight, isn't it? Um, I guess. Okay. I guess maybe it would, but it be it would be really close. That's a toin cost kind of scenario, isn't it? Um, okay. Yeah. Play to Braval Carro Bugum only because it's only Sar in the Crystal Palace attack that's doing anything right now. Yep. Rest of the team looks good. Good to go. I mean, if you got your triple up on Arsenal, you're pretty much good to go. Mafon says, \"You've convinced me to triple captain.\" Gabrielle, thinking of rolling um or making a goalkeeper transfer. Don't think you really need a goalkeeper transfer. You can just play to Bravka this week. Um yeah, aside from that, team looks strong. Yeah, I don't think this needs a transfer. Team's in a good shape. No, no changes other than swap goalkeepers to Bravkar on roughs on the bench. Although saying that, saying that Sunderland are pretty good at home. Nah, surely not. It's Liverpool. Come on, let's be sensible here. Let's think smart. All right, Ali's team. And we got a super chat whilst uh whilst we just wait there. Uh from EAC who says, \"Thanks for an amazing YouTube. How many minutes do you think Mawa gets between both Arsenal games? I have him, Timber Gabrielle, one transfer, 0.3 million. Um, honest answer, think you do well to get 120 minutes. I think that would be a success if you get 120 minutes from him. Um, I'm not totally convinced, but you know, you just got to hope during those minutes he does he does do something or whether that's a corner taken that's kind of knocked in by hopefully Gabrielle. Um, I don't know. Um, but yeah, it's it's he's fine. Yeah, I think if you already have Madek, I wouldn't be looking to move him out, but not I don't know. Maybe maybe it's my own kind of profile of FPL asset I like to own, but Madd is not ideal. the the the big problem with Mekke is if Saka returns a little bit sooner than expected. If Saka's back for the second game in the double game week, then Mawke is being is going to be in uh big big trouble. Um but there's every chance that you know even if Saka's not back, we see one game where Arsenal play kind of Trosard and Martinelli on each wing or you know maybe someone else out out wide and that's the difficulty with Mawa. You just don't know. And the fact that the second game is so far away, the fact that even the first game is a couple of days away and there's been no press conference, it's very very difficult to come up with an accurate prediction, I suppose. So there we go. Matias says, \"Dan, thanks for the suggestions. If I do Saka to Rise and Foden tomb and burn, I still have 2 million left.\" It's not necessarily a bad thing. Definitely not a bad thing. No, I've got How much money have I got in the bank? I think after I make my I think I have 3.8 8 million in my bank after I make the child transfer, which is yeah, 3.8 million, which is loads, but it's fine. I want to have money in the bank because I want to upgrade Obi. I want to swap Rice out. I want to swap Enzo out. Um, I might even have to swap Collins out at some point as well. So there's um there's plenty of things in the future that we can be spending our saved money on. Right. So do we do team um three free transfers and four in the bank? This team, what does it need? It needs needs a tavern transfer, doesn't it? It needs a tavern upgrade. I'll do Tava tomb and Burmo Vertz or Rogers. One of those guys. That's what I would do, I think. Or you can go for another cheap if you if you fancy upgrading Obi to Thiago next game week. You could also just do Taer to a to a S. Maybe someone a bit more similarly priced to help fund the Obi upgrade. Or, you know, you go even cheaper. You go Anderson, you go Jbury Hall, something like that. All of them would work, I think. But ideally, you would buy someone to replace Anderson this week to allow you to bench Malik Chow this week, but I wouldn't use three transfers. I'd just use one this week. I think I'd probably play, would I play Wilson? I probably would play Wilson. Man City can be got at Trash Panda says I need to get a third Arsenal player. How are we going to do that then? Um, I think I'd just do pick for Terraa to be honest. You don't need double um or or Tarovski to to Timber. One or one of those. I think that's pretty straightforward. You don't need double Everton defense anymore. Um, at all really. What would I lean towards? Um, is Gabriel Chalaba, Nunz all playable this week? Okay, if you were to do Tarovski to Timber that would allow you a pretty nice four 42 and you can bench Wilson and Thiago if you wanted to. Alternatively, is the is it the better idea to actually just because you've got quite a strong attack, is it better to go picky? That would allow you to hide Rya in gameweek 31 on the blank gameweek. Maybe that's what I'll do. Write on the notes, but I'm really leaning towards Alder to Manurs and Jar Pedro to have there is no way I would sell Jar Pedro over the next two game weeks. Not a chance. Um now leadeds and Burnley I would I'm thinking about you know those people who will be captaining Jah Pedro in gameweek 27. So definitely wouldn't be doing that if you I mean look listen if you really really do want Havs in your in your team then I can't stop you. But um no it's not something I would even nearly consider if if this were my team. Um an Alderi to Mos. Do you need it? Do you need to have all five of your defenders cost over 5.4 million? It's too much money in defense considering the the wealth of cheap defenders right now. So, I don't think I would do that either. Um, yeah, I think if it's my team, I'm probably doing pick for Terra, but I also like Tarovski to Timber. And that's pretty much as far as I would go there. I'd save the extra transfer. I'd roll it on and that's pretty much what I would do. Yeah, but if you really want to do Pedro to have it, I can't stop you. Jessel says, \"Child to Hill. Any other suggestions?\" Um, I do like that. I mean, you could just go Richards. Chow to Richards maybe or mining to someone. May to star. If this is my team, what am I actually realistically doing here? I'm playing Rya. I'm playing Gabrielle O'Reilly, Kenate. I'm benching Chia Mukulele. Um, uh, yeah. Yeah, if this is my team, I'm probably doing Mayu Tasar. That's what I would do if it was my team. I don't know if that's the answer. You're probably not the answer you wanted to hear because every week you you have Minho on your team and every week I suggest some replacements for him. Um, and he's and yes, he's still here. So maybe there is an attachment there, but I can only tell you what I would do if it were my team. TomTom says, \"Wilson against Man City or Croo Jun against Everton?\" I think I'd play Wilson if it were my team. Yeah, I do Wilson. Play Thiago or Obie? It's a lose-lose. I don't know. Obie's going to get zero points. Thiago is going to get at least two. It's not bad. Could be a lot worse. Um, hey, I have Ekki on the bench. Who do I drop for him, Samuel or Pedro? No one. You keep Ekit on the bench. We're going to do a bench list fairly soon. So, um, hopefully we'll cover a lot of bench related questions. Um, we have I believe we've done all of our rate my teams. If there's any other members in the uh in the chat who do want a team rating, please do feel free to go ahead and uh if you want to join as a member as well, um you absolutely can do. Um joining as a member gives you access to a whole bunch of stuff. For example, the 100 experts video that was that went up this morning was actually available to members from like last night. Um, I didn't want to upload them publicly to no I didn't want to upload that video publicly too soon after the team selection video. So, I delayed it till this morning for everyone, but members typically will watch the video regardless. And, uh, therefore, I just put it up for members early. So, you're going to get early videos sometimes. Um, member streams, we do that most game weeks unless there's midweek games, which makes things difficult. Get access to the my planning uh, sheets as well. go join the private mini league and uh yeah, loads of other stuff. So, if you do want to join as a member, you can get your team rated straight away from today. And uh yes, but uh yeah, that's uh that's going to be at the starting 11 tier or above. And members, if you do drop your team in the uh the Google Drive, let me know. Let me know you've done it. Um flag it to me so I can have a look. Right. Anyway, back to business. I don't know what happened there. We had a bit of a lag on the transition, but Patrick says Columbus Cheese Heads and Jai and Stack out. Stack and Rogers in. Patrick, what does this mean, my friend? And Ji and Stack out. Stack and Rogers in. H Scott, yes you can. Yes, you can, my friend. Um, still trying to work out why there's two stacks. It's got to be It's got to mean someone else, right? Maybe someone cheaper. Who's real? Patrick, let me know. Uh, any wild card draft you can suggest? Yes. My advice on the wild card is to not use it. To be totally honest with you, I'd rather take like a minus eight than use a wild card. Oh, Anderson and Rogers. Oh, yeah. Okay. Um, yeah. Yeah, why not? If you want to. I don't think I, you know, I wouldn't do those moves for a hit. Um, I don't feel very particularly strongly about those moves. It's not something I'd be desperate to do necessarily, but yeah, if you prefer Anderson and Rogers, then absolutely go for it. Absolutely go for it. Uh, high, would you play DCL over Chaliba if you had them? Um, DCL is potentially ill, but no, I would play Chalibur. I play Chalibur. Timber to hill to fund over to Thiago and rice to V. Yeah, I like it. I like it for free. I like it. And it definitely improves your team, doesn't it? And it also helps you for game 31 as well. A lot actually. Cool. There we go. Zacharias says I added Richards uh on what's really first in the mini league uh as Mos or maybe for O'Reilly. I hate I don't have Villa or Palace attacker. Nah, it's not worth selling on Burmore or Enzo. Super chat from Trash Panda says first. Thank you your work and streams. They keep me saying it work. Good to know. Good to know. Also, I really want Minos. If not Aldereti, who would you kick out of my team from Chaloba Tarovski or Matas Nunes? I guess Tarovski, but like your priority is getting your triple Arsenal, right? Triple Arsenal is the priority. You could always if you wanted you to two do two transfers. Easy for me to say. Um, you could always do Tarovski to Mos and pick Vera. You can always do that. Yeah. But if you, you know, out of your defenders, your many many plethora of expensive defenders, Tarovski would be the first to go for me. But as triple up on Arsenal is the priority. That's like for everyone for everyone. Uh, Summit or Nothing says, \"Damn, what's the best free hit team this week? Haven't uh really seen it. Love the channel. Gets me through cardio at the gym.\" Good to hear, my friend. Good to hear. Um, however, I really, really would not recommend a free hit this week. I really wouldn't. Um, there's going to be so many better opportunities to use it. Um, there really is. So, yeah, this would probably be like, I don't know, something like the eighth best week to triple cap, uh, sorry, to free hit or something like that. It can't be worth it surely, unless your team just wasn't set up for this week at all. Um, so yeah, the best free hit is to not free hit. Um, the second best is triple up on Arsenal, triple up on Crystal Palace. Uh, probably at least two Man United, one or two Chelsea, and that would pretty much do you. Oh, and some Man City. You'd have a little bit of Man City in there as well. Probably Harland, maybe more. Not sure. Not sure, but something like that. FPL Vince, by the way, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel. Feel free to upload your team into the Google Drive, which can be found on my channel homepage, but only members at the starting 11 tier or above will be able to see that um that drive link and then you can just upload a screenshot of your team in there. Uh, hey Dan, what cheap defenders would you recommend? Um, Richard and Hill pretty much. Riches is 4.4, Hill is 3.9. I like both of them. Um, kind of backed up by the fact that I have both of them or at least will have both of them by the time we hit the deadline today. Bench list coming in 20 minutes. one sp with the 22 cent super chat. Uh, thank you very much for that. Um, I'll no message attached. I think there is a minimum spend to add a a message to chats. That is not enforced by me. That is enforced by YouTube. So, apologies for that. But I appreciate it regardless. I do appreciate that. Uh, should we see if there's any other rate my teams? No, there's not. That's fine. Keep it there. Just in case I'm going to need a new need a new orange squash in a minute. Joe's got the triple captain activated. 500% clean sheet coverage. Wait, so you're triple Arsenal defense, triple captain, Gabrielle. Oh my word. Remarkable. Remarkable. Would you buy a Strand Lson instead of Q if you had free transfers instead of the wild card? Um, it wouldn't impact me the wild cards. Uh, if you have free transfers, that is impactful though. Um, would I buy Shan Lson? Um, maybe we need to see. Well, I kind of want to see something from him. I guess the best time to buy is when the fixtures are good. It's a shame that he hasn't really shown much for Palace so far. Not that he's really had it very much time to do so. Um, yeah, man. It's it's it's it's a tough buy. You could do you could do I wouldn't I wouldn't rule it out. Um, if you're keen and if you do want to get that that additional forward in your team, then yeah, also depends who you're selling, right? Captain Yarez, is it a bad idea on a free hit? I don't I think captaining Yarez is a risky idea. We'll put it that way. I mean, going through the polls so far, 63% of you are triple captaining Gabrielle. 6% of you are triple captaining Rice. 4% of you are triple captaining someone else. And only 26% of you guys are not using the triple captain ship this week, which I find a little bit mad. Is it really that little? Are we really that heavy on triple captain this week? I didn't think it would be this heavy on Triple Captain to be honest. Unless some people are misreading the uh the uh question, the poll question. Thoughts on transferring Vanderventan out for Richards? Yep. Like it. Like it. Rice for Rogers. Uh I already have Ray and Gabrielle. H I don't love it. I don't love it to be fair. I'd be looking to remove a player I didn't want to have long term. And I think Rogers is a player I'd want to have long long term. Ross says bench Hill or Thiago. The Arsenal fan in me says bench Thiago. Hill has the higher ceiling. I think there's a good chance Hill conceds, but you know, Defcon is always um a possibility there. Four pointer, whereas Thiago, we're probably going to get a two-pointer if we're honest. Treble captain this week, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Too uh many things could prevent a better option later. Agreed, Carl. Absolutely agreed. which is exactly why I'm going to be triple captaining Gabrielle this game week. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Play Vert or Gayhee. Oh, that's a tough one. I guess you got to play Vert, right? I need to ask my wife if she wouldn't mind grabbing me a drink, but I don't think she's home. Let's check. Let's track her location. Oh, yeah. She is nowhere near home. Anyway, where were we? Right. Uh, would you play Enzo or Rogers? Enzo. I think I heard someone talking about how Timber has a ceiling as a triple captain. I don't think uh Timber has a higher ceiling than Gabrielle because Timber doesn't get defensive contributions. So if you're saying that Timber and Gabrielle, even if you say they have similar, you know, goal threat, attacking potential, whatever, then Gabrielle's still more likely to get Defcon and therefore that improves the ceiling. Huan says, \"Will Yakarez play both games?\" Honest answer, don't know. Um, yeah, the the the second game, well, the first game is not for another couple of days. The second game is not for another week, and it's so difficult to say right now. There's there's going to be a game in between those two as well in the FA Cup. So, it's so hard to get a judgment on what will happen in the second game. If I had to guess, I'd say he starts one game and is maybe on the bench for the other. But if he, you know, if he plays well in the first game, gets another goal, why not why not why why can't he start the second game? So, I think there's a chance of both happening. Uh this is this and and this is the exact problem. This is why I'm just saying just pick three out of Rya, Gabrielle, Rice, Timber. Just pick three out of those four. You know what you're getting. You can feel confident. You can feel happy. Everything's great. Everyone else is has some kind of question mark that nobody can answer. Mal Arteta doesn't know if if he's going to start Yokarez in the second game of the double gameweek yet. Probably has a good idea for the first game and he probably will start for the second game. Yeah. If the man if if we're in a situation where the manager probably doesn't know if they a player is going to start in the second game or not, then what hope do we have as FPL managers really? which is why I just don't want to play that game personally. When will we know about the when the teams will uh blank in game day four? We will know. Um let me just find my chart. Uh no FPL double game calendar. So, I really like my calendar. So, we will find out for 100% by not until the game 32 deadline. Is that right? Yeah. Wait. Yes. Yeah. We'll find out for 100% who blanks in gameweek 34 and indeed who doubles in 33. not until after the gameweek 31 deadline and indeed after the international break. So you're looking at like this is going to be something like the 5th of April or something like that before we find out. So two months away before we find out who's going to be doubling in 33 and blanking in 34 at least. That's when we'll know for sure. We'll have a good idea. Well, we'll have a better idea by uh by this weekend. We'll have an even better idea than that by the gameweek 30 deadline and then we'll have that verified by the gameweek 32 deadline. So, lots of variable lots of variables in play still. Lots of variables in play. Uh, good afternoon, Dan. What are your thoughts on Wilson? Should I sell for Enzo? No. If I didn't have Enzo already, I wouldn't be buying him anymore. In fact, that pretty much goes for all Chelsea players. If you haven't already got them, it's maybe too late. Maybe. Unless you have a lot of transfers going at the moment and you can afford to move them in and out because any Chelsea player you're really only looking to keep for two game weeks and that's really is that worth a transfer? I don't know. The other thing is there's just with Enzo in particular, there's so many great midfield options. You don't have to go for one that only has two good fixtures when there are a bunch of others that have great fixtures all the way up until gameweek 31 inclusive. Salem says have two free transfers by Timber for Tarovski and Triple Arsenal defense or just Riceford and Jai. Uh, what will I do? Probably rice in forai to be honest. I don't do see anything more about fitness. Yeah, he's trained so I think that's a positive thing. Trained normally. So maybe it was just cramp or something um when he was spotted limping the other day. Rice or Zimbaby? Rice. Nob brainer. Hill or Chiao. Who to start? Hill. No. Rya. I have Rya. I like Rya. Is it worth using a wild card? No. I'd rather take a minus eight than use a wild card this game week. Although fingers crossed you won't need to take a minus eight. Rogers to Rice. or do I just go double Arsenal? Um, I would I would prioritize triple Arsenal. If if Rochester Rice is really genuinely the only way to resolve that that uh that Arsenal situation, then I guess that's what you do. I would look for another route though. Is free hit gameweek 31 a good idea? Not in my opinion, because gameweek 34 is going to be in theory a significantly bigger blank gameweek. So yeah, gameweek 34 is going to be problematic for a lot of FPL managers, I think. Um, and therefore, yeah, uh, you use your free hit in gameweek 31 or sorry, in 20, no, 31, right? Use your free hit in gameweek 31, you'll get to gameweek 34 and you'll probably regress it probably. Anyway, how do you find and buy hill so early? By the way, your process is crazy good for catching these cheap beasts. Thank you, my friend. I I kind of agree. Um, yeah, is I think one of my few strengths in in the game of FPL. Obviously, we can't get everything perfect, but something I feel like I do do okay with is uh yeah, identifying those cheaper FPL assets. Um really it's just keeping an eye on um well first of all I noticed he was playing which is always a good start. Uh I noticed he was playing every game. Um after that I was like okay this is interesting. Hang on. We'll just answer super chat. Scorpio says oh Riley and Sessi to Gabrielle and triple captain and heal for minus four. Is that really the only way? If it is then yes. If you're desperate to triple captain Gabrielle and that's the only way, then yes, do it, I guess. But it's an Essie to Hillfield sideways. Yeah, I just noticed he was playing um I checked his Defcon numbers. They were really, really good. I checked his um his player ratings on F Mob. They were really good. I checked then I checked press conference notes. um the manager Iola was praising him and you know it's sometimes it's just you see one thing and then that you think oh that's interesting let's you know let's deep dig it bit further and if you're convinced again then you dig a bit further if you're still convinced you dig further and then um and then it ended up really being me just being completely convinced by him. Um but that said look I think he is a good pick. I think he has good value for money, but I'm not going to deny the fact that picking up an assist, which is basically just a a regular pass to Ryan who ran up ran up the entire pitch and did scored a solo goal. That is a just luck really. And really gave me 25 was more like a four-point appeal, but still really good. Um, but yeah, another thing I noticed is his defcon is incredible, man. It's so so good. It's so good. It's better than Sessi. So, it was enough to convince me to go for him. Yeah, I guess the first step is seeing if a player is actually playing and then after that, okay, what are their defcon numbers like? That's always step two for me. When I notice a player looks interesting, check their defcon numbers. If they're strong and hills were really strong, then um then you could be on to something. Uh, CIA says, \"Hey, Dan, do you still have hope on Arsenal winning the league?\" Yeah, I mean, I think so. I think so. I don't see why not. Arsenal's uh league to lose really. So, I feel fairly confident there. Play Mane or Ryan. Oh, I'd maybe go for Mane because of the double game week and also because we are expecting some rotation from Bournemouth and that may come into play with Ryan. Not sure. Juan says, \"Love from India. Love the chip strategy video. Have been following you since gameweek 2. Upload um uh since gameweek 2. Upload on Spotify podcast please. Also, Bowen's echk or verts for a minus four.\" Uh no, I wouldn't take a minus four to remove Bowen. I'd rather just play Bowen to be honest than take a minus four. Um, upload to Spotify. People have asked me about uploading to Spotify before, but honestly, um I don't it's it's time consuming and I appreciate that a lot of you guys would enjoy it, but I'm not really sure how it benefits me or the channel because all it potentially does is siphon views away from YouTube to a place where I wouldn't be making money from the uploads And that obviously is important when doing this is literally my job. Um, so I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I mean maybe I'll go back on Spotify and do something, but I'm not I don't I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced. Maybe I need to speak to someone about it and how it all works. All or the other thing is with with Spotify is a lot of my videos are quite graphical based. Like always have graphics. I usually make graphics. Um you know I'm not a I'm not a slideshow FPL content creator. I'm making stuff all the time and animating things and all kinds. So um yeah, I just don't know if it's suited. But anyway, um wouldn't make the Bowen move. Uh at least not this week and not for minus four. David says, \"Is duel go to Richard's worth doing over starting Thiago?\" Yes. Yeah, I would do it. I would do it. Craig says, \"Gabrielle, Chaliba, Virgil Van Djke, Rodon, and Dorgu in my defense. Can't decide if I should sell Dorgu or roll again.\" Um, well, you can play Gabriel Chaliba Van Djk as long as your um as long as your uh attack is fine, I guess. Yeah, that would kind of be the the important factor there. If your attack is in good shape and you don't need to play a four at the back, then I think you could just stick with what you've got and just roll. But if you do feel feel you need an additional player then uh yeah Doo to Hill or Riches good work. Joe says, \"Love the graphics, Dan. One of the best visual storytellers in the FB space.\" Good to hear, Joe. Thank you very much. And Joe, I I also like your graphics as well. I like your your um micro animations. And I wish I knew how to do them better. I really do. Um because I am I think I'm good at Premiier Pro. I probably could do more on Premier Pro if I put more time into it, but I'm terrible at After Effects. So, a lot of the micro animations I just don't have the time nor energy to figure out. Um, and you do them really well, Joe. To an extent where I am jealous, where I'm jealous. And I wish I could include more stuff like that in my own videos. Um, because it's awesome. I love that kind of thing. But uh yeah, appreciate the uh the kind words regardless. Um Dominic uh thank you very much for coming for becoming a member of the channel. Absolute legend. Um if you want to upload your team for a rating, you can do so by uh going to my channel homepage, finding the Google Drive link, and uploading an image there. Beautiful stuff. Is it roughly know known which teams will have a double game at 36? The two most likely teams are Man City and Crystal Palace, but it's up in the air. But yeah, but those are the most likely teams. Could be some other teams as well. Could be no other teams. Could be no teams whatsoever potentially. We'll have to wait and see how many teams will be blanking uh approximately for game 34. Eight. Eight teams blanking. Benji says, \"Hill or Thiago?\" I'm sure Captain Gabrielle hoping Thiago blank. It's up to you. Do you want to hedge with Thiago and kind of try and play both sides that way you always come out on top or are you happy to go Hill? I would probably play Hill. I prefer to go all in, but uh I don't think there's a wrong answer there necessarily, and I think they'll probably they probably projected similar scores. I would go Hill though. Taster says, \"Bench one, Rogers, Nunez, Caliber, Anderson, Mane, Enzo.\" Is the answer Mané? It might It may well be. It's either Manet or Anderson, I think. Let's say one of them. Uh, it is officially 1 hour till deadline, by the way, guys. One, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel, my friend. Um, yeah, it's officially 1 hour till deadline, and that can only mean one thing. It means that we need to do a bench list. Oh, we've not done a bench list all day. We've not done one since the weekend. It's been way too long. We need one. B Sharp, thank you very much for the super sticker, my friend. Appreciate it. Mucho appreciate web app. I'm so curious to learn how that works. Interesting stuff, man. Maybe I could learn a thing or two from you, Joe, to be fair at this point. Uh Carl says up to eight teams blanketing in gameweek 34 for the uh semis unless if the semi-finalist play each other or other non Premier League teams get through. Yeah, exactly. Spot on, Carl. Spot on. Pop. Um, by the way, if you intended to include a message there, I will keep an eye out in this in the chat for any messages. So, don't don't worry about sending another super chat or anything like that. If you have a message, just put it in the chat as a normal chat and I will try and keep my eye out for it. Right, bench list. Bench list. Let's start it off. Is there any odds of cities doubling at 36? Um, the odds really are just the odds of Man City and Burnley's combined chances of getting to the FA Cup semi-finals and then also factoring in the Premier League doing some weird things, which is also very possible. And you have to then factor in uh European Cup stuff. It's hard to figure out, but it would be over 50% chance, well over 50% chance of I would say uh intuitively of City doubling in in gameweek 36. Well over it would be over 50%. Yeah. But there's also a scenario where Man City don't reach the FA Cup semi-finals and still double in 36. There's there's also that scenario, too. Um, but there we're just so early. There are just so many moving parts and I wish I could give you a more conclusive answer. I really wish I could, but there's so many variables and factors in play that need to be resolved before we can give a more accurate answer. And as each week goes by, we'll be able to get a more accurate answer. But I appreciate that that doesn't help you right now. And a lot of people need these answers right now, but they just don't exist sadly. Uni says, \"Are we trouble captain Gabriel or no?\" I mean, I am my friend. Um, kind of up to you. Alistister, thank you for the super sticker there as well. Uh P Sharp says, \"Cheers Dan Chaliba or Riches to start.\" Tough one. Let's um let's kick let's kick the bench list off with those guys, I guess. And I'm actually going to put Riches ahead of Chaloba. I'm actually going to put Riches ahead. Um Riches has slightly better clean sheet odds and is typically a slightly better defconer as well. So I think that leads me towards Riches over Chelan. I think leadeds are a decent team in attack. They are more than capable of scoring in any given game week. And Nicole says, \"Hi Dan, 73 points in game 25. Uploaded my team to drive.\" Nicole, you are you snuck in. Not really at the right moment because we were only doing the team ratings in the first hour. Um, but regardless, looking at your team, you already made your transfer, so it doesn't really look like you're looking for any advice anyway to be fair, my friend. And I think you look like you're good to go. So, uh, yes, good luck, Nicole. Good luck, my friend. Uh, Evok, uh, says uh, Cherokee or Ivo. No, that says Ivo. It doesn't say Evo. It says Ivo. says, \"Churkey for Rogers or Sar?\" If it's me, I'm going Saw. That's okay, Nicole. It's no problem. Um, yeah, I go for Saw as a Turkey replacement, personally, I think. Right. Anyway, bench list. Who's going on there? Who's going on there? Thiago's gone on apparently. I'm going to put him here. We're going to put Vugan and Dravka on because I know a few people have that very question. And I am going to marginally put Dra Da Dravka ahead of Vugan Vugan. Drafka Vrava Bugan Dugan Vravka Vdugan. Sorry, my my brain melted there trying to differentiate between names that don't look similar but are surprisingly difficult to say in tandem. Um, okay. Right. Mane is a big question this week, isn't he? I think I play him over the bugan to stean. We're talking about toen or the bugen or dravka. Um, O'Reilly. O'Reilly I put reasonably high this week. Would I put him above Chaliba? Probably not. But I think I put him above. It's that small rotation risk is going to drop O'Reilly down a little bit. But I think he's a reasonably decent pick. Defcon though. You know what? I'm going to drop him lower than Thiago. Uh, I will put play a player like Crooppy Jr. below though. I don't know if anyone asked for Crooppy Junior, but um if not, you can just tell me. Dan didn't ask. Nobody cares about Creepy Junior. And if so, I'll just throw him my hands up. Muki. Okay. Players like Alder, Muki, they're going lower. Not as low as someone like Collins. I would marginally put Chiao higher than these guys. marginally Sessi. I'm going to put Sessi and Hill together because I do think they are much of a muchness. And I'm going to put them here. Um, super chat from Jandre says, \"Hi Dan, I have one free transfer. Is Gu to Krooppy Jr. or Vanden Vandenberg to Sessi worth a transfer to start? Either of them had a Harry Wilson. Which one do you prefer if any? I mean, I'd be fine to play Harry Wilson for what it's worth. Um, due to creepy I wouldn't do personally. Vandenberg to Sessi. I would think about I but I would probably be more likely to do Vandenberg Vandenberg to Hill at this point. And if you already have Hill, then I wouldn't double up on the Bournemouth defense. The other option is to go for a Crystal Palace defender like Richards. And those are your options there. Oh, Cat Lewin hasn't traveled according to a lead in the no. Is that true? Hang on. Sorry. I am going to have to verify that. Uh what got Lu? The game's tonight, isn't it? Wait, no. Yeah, it is. Yeah, of course it is. Away from home. I don't know. I'm not seeing anything. Not seeing anything on Calum. It's on your forum. Um I don't know, man. It's not something I've seen before, so I can't just automatically trust it, unfortunately. 47 months, Jandre. Crazy stuff. You almost got You're almost on the 48th month badge. That's a long time. N8 the Great says, \"I have timber and rice. Should I use my one free transfer for XDK to Yarez? And if so, who should I captain? Is Yarez too bold? Triple captain? Yeah. Is there no way of getting Gabrielle and triple captioning him? Juan, please do not spam my friend. I will add Wilson in just one moment. Um, should I use should I use the one free transfer exas? Probably not. Probably not. Nate the Great. Um, I would try and get Gabrielle up. That is your priority. And I would, you know, if you only have one free transfer, I would probably even take a minus four to make it happen. So, if there's any defenders you don't like and maybe another player who you may have been thinking about transferring for a while. If you think you can improve your team using both of the two free transfers, including getting Gabrielle in, then that's what I would do personally. If you can't get Gabrielle in, if it was my personal team, I probably would just forego the triple captain entirely and wait for a future double gameweek. Wait to see what happens in gameweek 36. If you don't have Gabrielle, some argument to triple captain Timber. Um, I guess. Don't know, man. I don't know, man. So, Wilson Wilson needs to go here, doesn't it? Somewhere. I mean, like I said, I would be fairly willing to play Wilson. It wouldn't be top of my list, but you could play him if you wanted to. They're a worse place to play. Eat. I would play probably You got to play him above Mane, right? Something like this. Thoughts on Havits? Little risky for me, but uh I don't hate him as a pick to be fair. Emmanson and Bowen seem to be popular in the chat. Gandre says, \"Wife is anxiously shouting from the kitchen. Ask him if he would start RAL or Anderson.\" Got to love the women playing FPL. You got to love everyone playing FPL. Well, you got to love it indeed. Uh, why is she shouting? She she she got her own device. Hop on the stream. Ask me yourself, Mrs. uh Mrs. Jandre. Um, okay. So, Anderson or Ra? I feel like I'd probably play Anderson. And I think that's reasonably straightforward as well. Um, I'm going to put Anderson here on on the um on the bench list, but yeah, I would play him above. Um, there's another super chat here from Kash that says subs and sh replacements, please, Dan. Uh, okay. Could you do Sar and Hill? Freeing up a little bit of money actually for some future moves. Unless you already if unless you don't have Arsenal players in which case your your Arsenal guys are going to be your replacements but yeah assuming you have triple Arsenal already saw and Hill or you know you could if you can go up to like V or Burmo and Hill that would be an option there as well. Um you if you are not going for Sar I'd be more likely to go for someone like Richards or Mos as well. You could go a little cheaper in the midfielder position potentially there. So there you go. There are a whole bunch of options for you. All of which are great. Uh Yash says, \"Hey Dan, two free transfers. O'Reilly DCL to Minor Man worth it?\" Can you help me with stats for triple captain Rice? I'm not really sure what you're looking for stats wise. A rice is playing a little deeper at the moment, so he's probably not going to have as much attacking threat open play, but he's still on those set pieces, which is always helpful. Um, is O'Reilly and DL to Minor and Mané worth it? I mean, I'm not massively keen on the Mane transfer generally to be honest. So, I think, you know, he's probably going to get four to seven points this game week. More likely four, maybe even three. and he just causes you a problem in gamewick 31. So I don't know man why man not tou cuz man's cheaper. That's the only reason really people are going for mane. I think Marley is on set pieces but obviously to t to better open open play threat and potential penalties as well. I'm not sure who's going to be the penalty taker. Um, next Alistister says, \"Uh, hey Dan, should I start Anderson versus Wolves over Mano double game week?\" Uh, they're both on the bench list, my friend. So, hopefully that helps. We'll uh we'll throw in Verts as well maybe. But in terms of O'Reilly and DCL to Munoz and Mane, I don't think I would do it with two free transfers. I don't think I would. If you need an extra player, I mean, you can play O'Reillyy's perfectly playable this week. Zanna, not keen. Not keen. Right. We said we were going to do Bowen. We said we were going to do someone else. Who escapes my brain right now? Who was it? Remind me guys who I was going to put on the on the sheet. Right. Bowen first of all which is a toughish game really against Man United and the underlying numbers have not been great. I'm going to put Bowen mean similar situation to to Thiago where probably not going to have much open play threat but does have penalties. So I think in that but is a better fixture like Manchester United is obviously particularly at home is an easier fixture. So in that sense I maybe bump Bowen here. Super chat from Linus says stuck between Gayhei and Chalaba Enzo and Burmo. Buying or playing? I think I'd play. Would I play Gay overcalibur? Maybe not. No, probably not to be fair. Would I? It's tight. I maybe put Gay here. That helps. And like there's just no way you bench surely. And no way you bench in Burma either. You got to play both. Oh, Evan Nilson. That was the other player I was going to put on. Thank you for the reminder. So, Evan Nilson away to Everton. Um, he's got to be better than Thiago and Bowen, right? So, and we think there is a good chance that Evan Nilson's on penalties. So, does something like that make sense? Is there a tiny bit of rotation risk for Evan Nelson? Maybe. Maybe. Why would Shahal Petro go on the bench list? Why would you bench Schwar Pedro? Surely not. Surely surely not. Right. Floren Verts. Going to put him in a similar situation to Echk to be honest. Um, who would I put above? I'm going to put Verts above. What am I? I'm going to put They're pretty much on par. I'm going to put Verts and Echk on par. Just expensive Liverpool attackers altogether. All together. All right. Should we do some goalkeepers? Maybe Kellaha. Uh I mean I think that's a pretty obvious bench. Don't know what other goalkeepers people typically have at the moment. Um Sanchez. I guess people have Sanchez. You're going to play him above most of these guys. Um through some of these goalkeepers. Um sure some people have some Oh, Cells is out by the way. Cells is unavailable. Uh Ruffs. All right. Yeah, Ruffs is probably going even lower still. Oh, sorry. Even some of the other guys. Not lower than Kell. All right, Tarovski, are you on Pikford as well? Okay, let's do let's wrap up the goalkeepers with Pigford. Jo S, you're obviously going to play unless you have Rya. Uh, so he doesn't really need to go on the bench list. To be fair, Rya doesn't need to go on the bench list either to be fair. I don't know why he's on there. Nobody's thinking about benching him. Um, but yeah, Pigford, uh, a home to Bournemouth. You're probably going like here compared to some of these other guys. So above Dravka, right? Let's go back to the outfield players. We'll put Tarovski on here somewhere. Probably lower than Tessen Hill. Lower than Thiago. Maybe lower than O'Reilly. Maybe similar to O'Reilly. I'm going to go here. Okay, Keen. I mean, Keen's minutes are of some concern still, so I'm going to put him even lower. Van Dyk Virgil. Um, he's going to go maybe here. Is that right? It doesn't feel right, does it? Still doesn't feel right. Okay, that feels better. Enzo Lefay. Yeah, you're just not going to play Enzo Lefay realistically. Actually, you're more likely to play him than Collins, but yeah, I'm happy with that. Cash. Pretty indifferent about cash as a FPL pick. Maybe here. Not really super keen. Garner. Garner. Ghana. Ghana. Pretty reliable pick. Garner. He's like Anderson Light, isn't he? um losing some set piece share though now that Jbury Hall is back which has impacted him. So let's put Garner I guess a little lower than Anderson. I'm going to put him here. Garn Rice or Celiba Captain? Definitely Rice over Ciba. Definitely Rice over Ca. Should we do a captain poll? Just not no triple captain. So, let's um end that and we'll do Sorry, we'll add Meguire. Sorry, I know a few people are asking about Meguire. We'll add him in and I'm going to run up another poll whilst we add some a few more players to the bench list. So, Maguire um I guess above Tarovski, something like this. Maybe higher. Is that harsh? Maybe above Wilson. Yeah. Hey, Sheps is here. Member for 60 months. If I'm not mistaken, that's five years. Incredible. Incredible stuff. Uh, thank you, Callum. Nice to see you in here, my friend. Um, right, new super chat. It's£10 super chat. Thank you very much. Uh, Cmax Spud, sorry for so many questions. Start Keller or Vugan? Uh, Vugan. Um, which one to bench and Burma Munoz, Enzo Chaliba, JPL Rogers? I'm top 3K and got the triple captain on Rice. Would you do Gabriel instead? Any advice? Well, yeah, I would do the I would do R. Sorry, I would do Gabrielle instead. I am doing Gabrielle instead. I feel like Gabrielle has a higher ceiling. Um, so more potential for things to go very right, but also a higher floor as well. So just I think in every way um Gabrielle to me just seems a much better captain than Rice. Uh some people may disagree but we've spoken about that extensively uh throughout this week I guess. Um in terms of who to bench and Burma, Enzo Chalaba, Shah Pedro or Rogers. I guess I guess Chalaba is maybe the answer to that one. Um because I think Chelsea will probably concede to leads. So you're looking at a four-pointer from Chaloba, which is pretty decent still, but I think the other guys just have a higher ceiling. How how likely is O'Reilly to start? I think O'Reilly is first choice for Man City. I think that is to me pretty clear. But when you play for Man City, being first choice is not always the uh the entire uh set of conditions required to start games with Pep Roulette. Who do you think is on Pens if Yarez isn't on the pitch? It's not going to be Erdigard, is he? Because he's probably not going to play. Um Eza, maybe if he's on the pitch. Um man, that's hard. Um, okay. From recent memory of Arsenal penalty takers, it's been Saka, Yakarez, Erdigard. I'm trying to think prior to that, who have I seen take penalties? I think Eza could take one. He's taken them for Palace before. I think I think I have vague memories of Martineelli having taken a penalty for Arsenal. Um, Gabrielle Jesus has got to be in contention, I guess, if he's starting. I don't I can't see Havitz. See it? Uh did Tech Rice take a penalty. I don't know, man. I I just don't think I've ever seen Havs take a penalty for Arsenal. Gabriel and Pence would be nice, wouldn't it? Um I don't know. Let's Let's have a I'm going to have a look at um Hav's penalty record. Is that what you're angling for? You want Havs to be on penalties to give you extra justification to uh pick them up. Okay. So, uh Havz has taken penalties before, but never for Arsenal. Oh, wait. That's a lie. He's taken one penalty for Arsenal. Oh, of course he has. I remember this. This was when Havitz was kind of going through a bit of a goal drought. He hadn't been at Arsenal very long and they were trying to build up his confidence. They were already like 3-0 up. I believe Arsenal were like 3-0 up and Havs and Saka very graciously gave Sacka the penalty. That is the only penalty I remember Havs taken for Arsenal and it is by the looks of this record the only penalty Havs has ever taken for Arsenal. So yes, he has technically taken a penalty for Arsenal before, but the circumstances in which it happened do not lend itself to repeatability. Let's put it that way. So will he take penalties? Maybe. Maybe. He's taken them for Germany before. He's taken them for the odd one for Chelsea. He's taken a few when he was back when he was playing in Germany. Although that's like what, six, seven years ago now. Maybe maybe Habits takes a if everyone else is off the pitch, but it's uh how likely you'll be saying that is Ibrahim says own Timba uh and Omari Omari Hartinson. Uh so Timber and Omari to Sar sorry what's going on here? Own timber. Omari to Sar or heaven to Caiba or play Barry. Omari to Sar or heaven to Celiba. If you haven't tripled up on Arsenal yet, that's your priority. That's what you need to do first. So if going from Aiden he I'm presuming that's Aiden Heaven to Siba. If that is an option for you and your only way of getting a third Arsenal player, then I would absolutely do that. Z with a super chat here as well. Wilson to Vitz Enzo Rogers S or roll. I think I would roll. I know that's the boring answer. Um but honestly, I think that's what I would do because I think I quite like Wilson. The only exception to that is if you feel very strongly about Vertz, Rogers, or Saw. I would give Enzo a miss though, if I didn't already own him. I think the boat is close or the ship is close to sailing on that one. So, you haven't quite missed the boat, but yeah, you're getting closer. Ahmed says, \"Muno's in for Chiao. Already have Richards. I don't think I'd like to double up really. I'd prefer to go for a Bournemouth defender if you've already got Richards.\" Um, but you could you could still go for Minos. It's just I'm not super keen on the double up there. Uh and John Long says, \"Hello, mate. What about a goalkeeper for the next six gamew weeks? I'm a little sick of a burggainen.\" So trying to get him out and finally gain some points in the goalkeeper spot. Um six gameweek goalkeeper. I after this week I think Keller looks nice, but I'm guessing you're looking up until what? Uh game 32 wild card maybe. I think it would have to be Kellaha because the fixtures are good after this week. And you can always buy Kellaha or you know wait until next week to get Kellaha or if you do need to buy Kellaha this week, play to Bravka this week. Play your backup goalkeeper. So yeah, I guess Keller I guess Kella is the answer. It's just not a great It's just not a great jumping on point for Keller, is it? Shepsy, thank you very much for the 79 or $1 and zero cents as the case may be. Um, to let you know, Callum, uh, YouTube does not allow messages with super chats or super stickers as they're known below what is it like 1 pound50 or more. It is a YouTube thing. I did not implement that rule. So, I don't know if you intended to throw in some kind of message in there. Um, but that that is often the case. People will put in like less than the YouTube threshold for messages, hoping that the next box will give you the option to write a message. But there is no next box and clicking send just sends the money. But thank you though. We'll take it. We'll take it. You're most perfectly welcome, John Long. And thank you very much for the super chat indeed. And thank you everyone for the super chats today. They really do help out the channel, guys. You know, it makes up a big chunk of um my wage. Well, that failed heavily. Enjoy 1/8 of a point on me. Thank you very much, mate. I will. I truly will. You tried. But next time, you're going to have to you're going to have to pull pull out the big bucks. I'm going to have to see two quid on the table if you want to put in any messages in this stream or indeed any stream because that's just how it works. That's just how it works. All right. Um what we saying on bench list? Is there any players uh who you feel are missing? Any non-ifferial players? Because last time we had a problem. The over 60s were in the chat and they couldn't read the uh the bench list because I put too many names on there and it made the text too small. Have to wait for payday and then we'll send my profanity. Fair enough, mate. Um please don't say Oh, actually there might actually be an automatic filter so that you might you may end up failing again um if it filters out swear words and stuff. Uh but you're welcome to try it. Just please nothing that is likely to get my account banned. Let's just put it that way. Uh although I don't think that's very likely to happen because I've never made any offenses on this channel before. All right. Who is missing then? AI. There are a few people with a Jai. Yeah, I think he can go on. Hill is on there already. I'm not totally confident about putting um Calbertt Lewon on there just because I don't know his injury status. Uh Callum Sturgis with the super chat says Manne Richards and Laqua on the bench. Uh I've bench boosted. Well, good luck to you my friend. Really um holding out for that Burnley clean sheet there. Good luck. Good luck. Yeah, that's a lot of investment. I mean, I'm hoping for a for a nice Crystal Palace clean sheet as well against Burnley. Hopefully, it's uh hopefully it comes through. Um and good luck to you, my friend. And Jai, let's let's throw Jai in and then we'll get to that super chat from Luke. I would put Andai probably somewhere near here, right? Something like that. Okay, so Luke says, \"Can't get Rice. Would you uh would you would you recommend going for Esmart Martinelli?\" Definitely not Es Martinelli either because Trosard's available. Uh no, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend going for either of those players because I don't trust either of their minutes. I think you'd do just as well with a single gameweek player um compared to Eza and Marceli. So no, I wouldn't. I'd find another way. May maybe that means tripling up in defense. Maybe it means taking a hit. Um, yeah, I think you're just going to have to find a different way, Luke. I mean, some people like Zuba Mendy, not this guy. Yarez, maybe. Could you do Yarez as your third Arsenal? Way too chill says, \"Can't get Gabrielle, triple captain Rice, Ray, or Timber?\" I think if it if it was me, I I would maybe do Timber if I had to triple captain this week. But honestly, if I couldn't triple captain Gabrielle this week for whatever reason, I would just save the triple captainship for a future gameweek. I don't think there's anyone else from this Arsenal side that gives me enough confidence. And if you can't do Gabrielle, I think that would be really the um the tiebreaker because I don't think it's a super obvious decision to triple captain this week. I think there are multiple ways of doing things. Um, and anyone who's saving their triple captainship, absolutely fine. You know, it could work out even better. So, therefore, if you took Gabrielle away from me, that's what I do. I just saved the triple captainship. Uh, Ib sir says, \"XTK or Sha Pedro moving forwards. I wild carded on gamer 24.\" So, so it depends what you mean by that. If you're buying new, I probably wouldn't buy either this game week. I think Shah Pedro, the time to buy is probably past, but if you fancy a two gameweek punt and you need someone right now, then I'll go for Joel Pedro. Eat, I don't think I'd buy him ahead of Sunderland. I kind of be on the fence about buying him against Forest because it's an away fixture. But certainly from gameweek, so basically gameweek 26 27, Joel Pedro is better. Game 28 onwards. Echk is better is the simple answer to that. It depends. Do you need something right now? Can you wait? Dan, your triple vice captain is is is rice just for security? But I think technically I prefer timber just because I want I always try and make sure my vice captain is someone who is kind of ultra low risk um kind of player. Ultra low risk. And I think rice is that. I wonder if I can persuade my my dear wife um to get me a drink. Um hello pretty and you make me a squash. Um my poor chat um need me to stay here and answer their questions. There we go. Right, Rogers on the bench list. Are we thinking benching Rogers? We're not surely. Um, I mean, he would go to the top of this list to be fair, so I don't think uh I'll do that. Is Timber guaranteed to start both games? No, he's not guaranteed to start both games. No. I mean, there's every chance he does, but I would give it, you know, there's got to be at least a 10 to 20% chance that he misses one of the two games. You would you would imagine. Um yeah. Oh yes. He's making this squash. Amazing news. Is there Did anyone find out if there's a Keith Andrews press conference? Is that not happening today? Poor assho. Oh, make tea. Yes, please. Yes, please. Right. You know what? I think I'm ready to make my transfers. In fact, I'll wait till my squash arrives and Oh, no. Wait till my tea arrives as well. more cheers in the new the new transfers with a new drink. That's what we need. Will it be an orange or a black current squash? That's the question. Wifey guest appearance. We'll have to see. We'll have to see. I if if I know her, she probably will not want to come in because she's too shy. But we'll see. She's not been on the FBM YouTube channel in years now. Too long. Too long. Right. Is Uber Mendy a bad option? I think bad is probably the wrong word. It's just an uninspiring option and probably is going to get you four or five points. That's that's harsh. Uh you could probably expect six or seven points. Elderflower squash nailed on. If my wife walks in with an elderflower squash, well, I'm glad we did a fresh wash of towels this week. I'll put it that way because she's going to need a few of them and probably to rewash her hair because that elderflower squash would be all over her. Would you play O'Brien or Cash? Um, I would play I don't know. I guess I guess O'Brien. Honestly, I'm I've got the elderflower squash in my head now. is if she comes in with the elderflower squash. Get out of here with that utter woke nonsense. Who's on pens for Walls? Great question. I wish I knew. I I think there's a good chance it's going to be Tou, but uh honestly I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. just joined King Gusto bench list. I think you got to play Gusto. He's he's looking good for minutes, I think, tonight because uh James is still a little a little risky. You can't do that to Morgan. She's too sweet. I absolutely can do that to Morgan if she that that is that is that is not sweet behavior at all. That is wind up merchant behavior. She she would know I would hate that as well. So, if she wants to wind me up, oh, we two can play that game. Playful banter. Will Ju Hall ever make the bench list? Do we really have to put There's There's a lot of begging for Ju Hall on the bench list. I suppose he'll have to go on, won't he? I just don't really know where to put him. I guess like next to Andai. In fact, let's just put him here. Then we don't take up any extra space. You've never wanted something to happen more. Well, let's find out. Let's find out what happens next. Captain Gabriel or Yukarus? Definitely Gabrielle. Oh, I said I was going to do another poll. We're not long until deadline now. All right. So, uh, this is not a triple captain question. This is just a general captain question. Who is your game week 26 captain? And we're going to put Gabrielle Rice. Who else? Timber or other? I think that pretty much covers it. Is there anyone else I'm missing? There. Is anyone seriously Hello. Come in. I'm putting the poll in. Are you actually making appearance on the FBM YouTube channel? or you sneaking in the corner, not even using any words. That was one of the sneakiest sneaks. Thank you for that. Bye. See you soon. Well, I can tell you it's not elderflower. You want to take Should we take bets on what what flavor the squash is? Get your bets in. Right. Um, what we missing? Petravvic. Petravvic. I wouldn't mind playing Petravvic this week to be fair. Vimto. Vile. Vile. Um, Petraich probably probably here. I don't know. Right. Well, if anyone answered black currant, you are exactly correct. Summer fruit in February. in February. Vile. That's worse than elderflower. Elderflower vinto and summer fruit. Say fruit and barley. Next. Fruit and bar. You know what the worst one is? Lemon. Has anyone ever had lemon squash before? It's uh Ridiculous. That's good squash. That is a good That is a good Asda's own black currant squash. Max says, \"I love lemon squash, mate. Come on, man.\" Mark likes it as well. You guys need to all give your heads a collective wobble because that is vile. Summer fruits all year round. How can you If you're having one drink all year round, how can you possibly enjoy it? Lemon is elite. Get cultured down. No, I'm sorry. Am I Am I in the Twilight Zone? What's going on, man? What's going on? Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Um, right. Well, I'm going to make some transfers. Well, a transfer. So, I'm going to flick the bench list off the screen for a momentto. And we're going to do ciao to riches. We're going to lock this one in. Um, even if the Collins situation uh looks grim there, we have got some time. I mean, I don't I wouldn't even have to play him in 27 if I didn't want to. Um, I need to know basically by gameweek 28, is he good or is he bad? Because I would really like to play him from gameweek 28 onwards. Really like to play him. But for now, we don't need him. So, we've got our good friend Ricardo Shep. Even you like lemon squash. Oh man, I can't believe it. It's so bad, man. It's so bad. Honestly, I was like stranded in the middle of the Sahara Desert and all I had was lemon squash. I'd say, \"Mate, I'd rather wait till the next oasis. Even if there's a crocodile in there waiting for me, I'd rather take my chances with some proper proper swamp water rather than some chemically grown lemon swamp water. Terrible. Terrible. I'll take my chances. Um, right. So, I think I'm pretty much locked in now with 15 minutes to go till deadline. Triple captain's active. I mean, I'm if I had Timber, I'd probably vice captain him, but I don't. So, um, Gabri, uh, Gabrielle triple captain. I'm I'm so set on that at this point. Rice on the vice. Rice on the vice. It rhymes. It's just right, isn't it? Uh, pint of lemon squash or triple captain EAC this week. Oh, well, I'd have to take the squash, wouldn't I? I'd have to take the squash. Damn. That That would At least nobody ever put me in that situation. So gross. Like I've literally tried to drink it before and like I can't physically swallow it. It's so horrible. It's so horrible. Brenford Wool 100% score. 100%. Stick your mortgage on it then, mate. Stick your mortgage on it. You're that certain. Uh, should I transfer Keen to anyone? No. Here. Uh, yeah, potentially if you've got like a Hill Sessie, Richards, Mos shaped hole in your team, then maybe one of those guys could work. Uh, Benjamin with a super chat says, \"Donnaruma or Pigford in goal?\" I think Donnaruma's your guy. Any leaks? Um, any leaks? I doubt it. To be fair, to be fair though. To be fair though, what what leaks are you looking for? Reese James or Anthony Gordon? I think a good chance Anthony Gordon could be in the squad by the way today. Um, I don't know if that impacts anyone in any way. Papu says Premier League server is down. I can't change my team now. Um, have you tried the app? And if you tried the app, have you tried the desktop? Um, try a different device is basically is basically my advice. Uh or yeah or um uh if you are on mobile and you only have access to a mobile, if it's not working on the mobile app, try your browser, your inapp browser. That's what I would recommend. Uh haven't got any news other than this. This is interesting. Cash not pictured in training apparently. We will see what happens there. Um, yeah, that's all I got. That's all I got. Start Tatty or Rogers? I'd start Rogers. Would you play Wilson over cash? Yeah. Uh, Ipsster says, \"Dan, what do you think uh of triple captain Harland versus Fulham or Petro versus Burnley?\" Um, nah. I I'd really be looking at triple captaining on a double gameweek. If you don't do it on an Arsenal player this week, then really we're waiting to see if if gameweek 35, 36, or 37 become a double gameweek. Um, all of which have a chance to become double gameweeks. Technically, gameweek 31 does as well. Uh, no, game week 31. Is that right? Gameweek 32. So, technically gameweek 32 also has a chance to be a double gameweek. Um, but pretty unlikely. So, we may get another double is pretty likely that we'll get another double gameweek this season. Um, if you're not using a triple captain on this gameweek, then do it on another. I live to watch you press the panic button a minute before the deadline. Is there a panic button? There's no panic button. I'm chilling. Honestly, sometimes I am panicking. Today is not one of those days. Today I'm chilling. Team saved. Team looks good. Everything's in order. Gabrielle's triple captained. In fact, maybe I'll scroll up a little bit just to make it very clear that triple captain is active. Man's active. Can't see the bench, but who cares? We trust in him, Big Gabby. We do indeed, Benjamin. We do. Uh Henry says, \"Dan, don't triple captain Gabrielle trust me on this.\" I'm sorry, Henry. Um I don't believe we've met before, and it takes me a little while to build up trust with new people. So, uh for that reason, I'm I'm going to have to go ahead and not trust you this week. Um well, let's work on our rapport and we'll see. Mark says, \"Sorry, Dan, but I'm hoping for Enzo to fail.\" Fair enough, Mark. Fair enough. I mean, I'm hoping Enzo will do very well. I don't know if it'll happen or not. Finding out Bruno is benchwood. Uh, press the panic button. Are they They're not playing until uh later, are they? No, they're playing 45 minutes later. So, I think the chances of us getting a leak there is pretty low. We don't typically get Man United leaks. Actually, that's a lie. We do sometimes. But I don't know. The the game isn't until what, like 8:30? No, 8:15. So, pretty late. You know what? I'm looking forward to a footy extravaganza tonight, though. I'm I'm ready. I'm ready to go back in for more FPL after this weekend. A nice a second Green Arrow in a row. I'm I feel like I'm on a roll. I'm ready to go again. I just cannot wait for Gabrielle on Thursday. It's going to be so much fun, man. I love the triple. Triple captain is the most overrated, overhyped chip in the entirety of FPL. And realistically, the swing you're going to get from a decent triple captain is like 10 points on the crowd. I mean, um, but it's just so much fun. And I I think that's the purpose of FPL, right? To be fun, just to add that extra little bit of jeopardy. It feels like it's more Jeopardy than it actually is. And I don't know, it just it it does it for me. It does it for me. Chess said, \"It's my birthday. As a birthday gift, can you please reply whom to play? Bowen against Man United at home or Wilson against Man City?\" I play Bowen. But by the way, I think I'd play Bowen at least. There's not much in it. I think I play Bowen because he's on penalties. By the way, if it's not actually your birthday, chess, and this is kind of the new meta for getting people to reply in the chat, then honestly, fair play. I won't let it work on me again. So, I'm sorry anyone else who it's birthday who birthday it is today. Uh I will not be falling for it again. But, you know, for the creativity of using the birthday meta to get a chat reply, honestly, fair bloody play. Fair bloody play. You've even got people in the chat saying happy birthday. Here we go. Oh, look. It seems to be a few other people's birthdays in the chat. Hy funny how that works, isn't it? Funny how that works. Play Wilson or Chela. I'd play Chela. I'll put the bench list on screen. We'll put it on. We'll leave it on there for a couple more minutes. I have to play Wilson and Bowen. Not ideal. David, I think it could be worse. I think it could be worse, my friend. Jude says, \"Genuinely, it is my birthday.\" And then follows with an FBO question. If you if you just said, \"Genuinely, it's my birthday,\" I would have said, \"Happy birthday.\" But because you followed it up with an FBO question, I just have to be suspicious now. And I just feel like I don't know. I don't I don't Maybe I'm being made a fool of. So, I'm sorry, Jude. Can't do it. It's my birthday. Can you drink some lemon squash? No. David wants £10 because it's his birthday. I It's in the It's in the post in in your card, David. It'll arrive soon, I'm sure. Happy birthday to everyone in the chat. You know what? If it is your birthday today, if it you know what? Even if it isn't your birthday, happy birthday to everyone, regardless of if it's your birthday or not, because apparently it's arbitrary anyway. Who cares if it's your birthday? If it helps you get FBL questions answered, then um then it it could be. And who cares anyway? Just a random number. How many times the earth has revolved around the sun since the day you emerged from your mother, so who cares? Ryan says it's his wedding. You know what? Everyone wish me a happy birthday. Thank you guys. Thank you for everyone wishing me a happy birthday. It's everyone's birthday and yet nobody's um merry Christmas too. Why not? Happy Hanukkah. Happy Hanukkah. Uh and uh Eid Mabarak as well. Why not? Why not? Happy Pride Day. You know, happy Pride Day. Pride month. Is that Wait, it actually is Pride Month, isn't it? Okay. Happy not Pride month. I don't know. Happy Easter. Happy Pancake Day. Shrove Tuesday. It's my favorite day of the year. Oh, May Bank holiday. Wowers. Um, let's get back to FPL for the final five minutes before I lose my mind. Uh, it's because I've been streaming for too long. Uh, Momo Suzoko says, \"Hi, Dan. Two free transfers. Cash to Minos, Evan, to Evanson to Strand Larson, Anderson to Sar. Um, no, I don't think so. I wouldn't I don't think I'd bring in two Crystal Palace players. I just pick your poison. Uh, happy Black History Month. Happy uh Black History Month as well. That's the important one. That's the big one. Um I don't Yeah, I wouldn't do double crystal patch, but I think I could I certainly wouldn't do triple. If you had if you can afford to do cash to mono in one move, I would do it though. Evan Hilton to Strand Larsson and Anderson to Sar not really as keen on those moves. But cash to I I quite like if you can uh if you do that in one if not even even cash to to Richards is is pretty nice to me. He's pretty nice indeed. All right. Well, let's check. Let's keep an eye out for early team news. I'm hoping you guys are happy with bench list. If not, take a screenshot. It will last longer. And I will put my team on screen for the final few minutes of the stream just because the show team gang and not going to be happy otherwise. Going to be displeased at best. Let's take a screenshot of my FPL team as well before the uh deadline passes. 2 minutes till deadline, guys. Make sure we are locking in any final transfers, decisions, benchings, um triple captains. Is anyone still Is anyone here still on the fence for triple captain? Is anyone still not locked in? Marty O, I forgot how to say your surname. Om Mahoon Marty Mahoon says, \"Uh, here's some candy d'H.\" What on earth is candy dash? Is that Irish? Is that an Irish phrase? Here is some candy dash. Candy dash to be sure. Um, yeah, there are a few people in the chat. Oh, correct. It is an Irish uh term. Or yes, that's correct how I'm saying your name. Who knows? Who knows at this point? I need to write it down. Really, the pron pronunciation. Do'Sh. I know. I know. Do'Sh'ache is money. I've heard do'ach. Oh, it's sweets money. Oh, candy means sweets. Is that's like in America. Crazy. Weird. Um, okay. Well, some people some people locking in bench boost is crazy. It's dodged to my candy with gez. But I've never used the phrase candy. The only time I would ever use the word candy is if I'm singing 50 Cent songs, which doesn't happen very often. DCL or Rogers. Uh, Rogers. Kaisedo will score. Well, fair play. Shout out FPL crew. Dan, you make me laugh with the lemon squash bon anniversary. Thank you, Simon. And more. And yet still more people in the chat are still saying it's their birthday. Crazy candy floss. Oh yeah, sen backpacker. That's a good point. I would I would use the term candy if talking about candy floss. Uh right, literally 30 seconds till deadline, guys. So, um it is time to lock her in. Oh, that was a slurpy slurp. I need to go away from the This tea is not had a non I've not had a caffeinated cup of tea in a long time. At least two weeks. I was taking into consideration our American cousins. Oh, well that's your mistake. Right, guys? That is going to be locked. We're locked in. We're locked in, guys. The deadline has officially passed. Yes, indeed, guys. A midweek deadline. The first double gameweek of the season. We are ready to go. We are ready. I hope we're ready. At least I feel ready. And what's that? What's that I hear? Could it be? What could it be? Hello. Ah, okay. Okay. Right. I will pass the message on. I'll pass the message on. Sorry. It's It's Mikuel Artetta. Mikuel Artetta. Yes. Yes. MueL. Yes. Uhhuh. And we're still on for paddle on uh on Wednesday even though it's the day before the game. We're still on for paddle. We are fantastic, mate. Bring your own game. You're going to need it, my friend. All right. Adios, amigo. Bye-bye. Well, that was Mal Artetta ringing me to inform me that Gabrielle is is is going to haul this week. He's told me he's put he's put Gabrielle in charge of of of the of set pieces. Gabrielle is going to be on the end of every single one. None of this timber nonsense. None of this, you know, ball bounces out to for a second ball to Zuba Mendy or anything like that. We are going to be seeing a Gabrielle masterclass. Mikuel told me he he's told me it's happening. It's happening. So, uh yeah. Um I I would usually I'd say good luck to to Gabrielle, Triple Captain. You don't need it. You don't need it. Art has told me. He's told me. He's told me already. He's not going to put Gabrielle in the nine, though, which is disappointing. And he he he could not confirm nor deny whether Gabrielle would be on penalties either. Um but maybe he's teasing it. Maybe he's teasing it. Are we seeing a squash tier list? Well, considering I only drink two types of squash, orange or black currant, and I pretty much refuse to drink all others in uh my uh in a little stuck in my ways when it comes to squash. Uh I don't think there's much point. I would just put black currant and or black currant and orange in S tier. I'd put fruit and barley, summer fruits, apple and black currant in No, not apple and black currents elite actually. Um I'll put those in like D tier and then F tier would be like lemon and strawberry squash. Oh my word. I have had strawberry squash before. Vile. Absolutely vile. Orange and pineapple is like a sea tier. Why mess about with it? Shepsy says, \"Dan, it's my nan uh Eene Dover's birthday. She's 67 today. Could you give her a shout out?\" Well, Shepsy Shepsy Shepsy, let's figure this out for a second. You're 32 years old. So if your nan was 67, that means you you both your nan and your mom would have been teenagers when they had one another. And you I don't know if uh if that works mathematically um but in case in case it does uh happy birthday to Shepsy's nan do 67 today. Happy birthday. Um right. What else we got here? Thanks for the great channel, Dan. Sometimes I do wonder if it is a great channel. Sometimes I do wonder. Um, Los Hobbits says, \"Thanks, Dan. Have a great week and good luck with the trouble captain. Going to watch some anime now like real men do.\" What anime, Lost Hobbits, I need you to answer me that before you go. Uh, something backpacker says, \"So, basically the next charity stream, guess what the crowd want you to drink a pine of?\" Hey, look. If it's for charity, then this is different. This is different. There are a few things I would not do for charity. That's like there are so many things I wouldn't do for charity. I mean, look, I try and be a a nice guy, a generous guy where I can, but everyone has their limits. Uh, everyone has their limits. I watch you and FPL Tom, but all FL guys are cool. I I hopefully agree. Hopefully agree. I do still want to at some point try and attempt the longest ever FPL stream for charity. So maybe maybe that can be the one where we set various challenges such as drink flavors of squash that are quite frankly vile. Um, and maybe we could do we can set up a a series of oh what we could do we could do like a spinny wheel and every time we hit a ch like a charity money target we spin the wheel of forfeits and one of the forfeits can be like wear a Spurs football shirt for the next hour. One could be um like drink a pint of lemon squash just other vile things that I definitely don't want to do. We could do something like that. That could be fun. We could do something like that. We're talking about bird legs again, man. Uh, what else? We can do a watch along. I don't think I'll do a watch along. I think I'll just do like a like a dayong deadline stream. Like an ultra long deadline stream. Or unless you do unless you'd rather do like a watch along for like a a full days worth of football. Maybe Mark has sent a gifted membership into the chat, but who will be the one to receive it? It's Cravac. Congratulations, Cravac. And thank you very much to Mark for gifting a membership. Absolute legend. Sravac, make sure you say thank you. Uh, what else we got here? Uh, FC26 watch along. Does anyone really want to watch him play FC 26? I you know what? I don't even I don't even play Ultimate Team and I haven't done since like October. Honestly, I did not last long on Ultimate Team this year at all. In fact, I've got I've got a load of FC points just sitting on my account unused because I was like, I'm not enjoying this game enough to justify spending these FC points that I have already bought. So, I'm saving them. So, I'm just saving them for next year. What about lemon sorbet? Can't say I've ever had it. Maybe the start of next season you can do a full day stream up till deadline. The only problem with that is is I'm usually like crazy busy in the runup to the first deadline with a million different things. Um, plus like events and stuff as well. If I'm going to like FPL related events, which I often am at the start of the season, meetups and stuff, which I haven't been to an FPL meetup since since gameweek one deadline day. I need to go to another one, but I just don't know. I don't know when the dates are. I will go to I will go to some more FPL meetups soon. And if there's any around the country, I might may even go somewhere slightly different. Right. Uh, and we can get a selection of ideas for the wheel of uh, misfortune. Yeah, we we'll do some we'll do some uh, brainstorming. We'll do some brainstorming for that. I need to figure out when the stream is going to be first of all and what we'll do, whether it'll be like a really long deadline stream or like a watch. Dan, why did you leave Richardes in your starting 11? What do you mean? Why did I leave him there? It's where he's meant to be. He's right exactly where he's supposed to be in life. Congratulations to the young man. Um, yeah, Burnley at home. No brain. All right. Uh, Muhammad says, \"Are you a full-time YouTuber now?\" Yes, and I have been for what is it coming up? Five years. That doesn't seem right. How long have I been married? I actually need to work this out. When did I quit my job? I quit my day job in like June of or July July 2021 which means I will be I will have been five years as a full-time YouTuber as of July. Wow. How on earth am I going to reintegrate with the regular world after that? How on earth am I going to reintegrate into normal society? You guys are just going to have to keep watching my videos, I'm afraid. I am not going back to the offices. I'll tell you that right now. I'll make videos for nobody before I do that. And unfortunately, I'll have to become a burden on my family who will have to fund my lifestyle. Uh uh what we got here? Oh my god, mate. I'm so scared. Are we going to do well? Yeah, of course we are. Been watching you since the 201920 season. Gosh, time flies. That is a long time to be fair. A very long time. Uh, are you going to do lineups? Yes. Yeah, I'm waiting another four minutes for the lineups and we're going to go through them and have a little look. What was your full uh full uh wait, sorry, trying to read this again. What was your profession before doing this full-time? I was a really I don't know how to describe it because I did I had so many I worked for a small company and basically did a little bit of everything. Bit of admin, bit of web administration, bit of design, bit of customer service. bit of like um but like the the relevant stuff I guess was the um the user interface uh UI and UX design which I was doing and I guess just design work in general. I mean I've done design stuff at least freelance for 10 years. Um, so yeah, yeah, graphic design I've been doing free, well, not the last five years I haven't been because I've been doing YouTube, but but saying that, even when I first started the YouTube channel, I was doing a lot of freelance uh graphic design for bits and bobs. I did a lot for Fantasy Football Hub. Um, a lot of the stuff they still use the in in terms of the FPL community, the thing that I that as a designer rather than as a YouTuber that I pioneered as an FBL behind thes scenes designer is, you know, when you you watch podcasts and underneath, you know, FBL podcasts, right? I don't know if any of you guys watch any of them, but there's loads of them out there. And sometimes they will have like their name underneath them. So that their name would be like down here and it would say their rank and then a an arrow, a green or a red arrow going up or down. I was the first first person to add that in to any uh podcast, any uh any FPL podcast. I was the first person to add that that little arrow. Um, fun fact for you now. Everyone does it. Pioneer, my friends. Pioneer. Tiny little detail, but you everyone does it now. Everyone does it. But like to be fair, when I first started doing FPL stuff, the the the space was fairly barren. Like, you know, there wasn't a lot of people doing it, and those that were doing it weren't doing much. So, But yeah, the bench list 100 experts. Yeah, they're things that I started and then everyone a lot of people doing um bice void tier lists. Um generally speaking, whole bunch of stuff, but I think that's just because I've been around for so long at this point. I'm I'm I'm basically an old fogy when it comes to FPL content at this time, which is crazy to say. It's pretty crazy to say. We'll try and find some uh some uh lineups and stuff. We go to Let's go to Chelsea first. Chillshoot. Chillshoot. Chelsea. Clearly influenced the FPL community in many ways. I think I have. I think I have. I hope I have. I hope I've been a nice, you know, I hope my uh I have a a legacy that lives on when I'm done in the FPL community, which hopefully is not for a very very long time. If it does have to come to the end, hopefully I may I left a good mark that continues onwards and uh inspires the next generation of FPL content creators. That would be a nice way to end if it had to. But there we go. Thank you very much for the kind messages, guys. Computer stuff, basically. Yeah, that was my old job was computer stuff. He's the He's He does the computer stuff. That Dan works for us, does computer stuff, but I work for a company where everyone did computer stuff. So, so there you go. Right. Come on, Chelsea. Chelsea, FPL, Dan, you should be proud of yourself. what you're achieving is amazing. Thank you very much. I do appreciate. I really do. Still get imposter syndrome uh quite often, particularly Oh, I think F are tweeting the uh tweet stuff out. Are they tweeting stuff out? Maybe. Uh yeah, particularly with the last couple of seasons where my ranks have not been ideal, but um things can change fast. Please be here. Okay, Hill's here. Hill's here. Sessi's here. Ryan's here. Who's not here? Crooppy Junior on the bench. Okay, we have our first uh catastrophe uh of the gameweek 26 midweek gameweek. There's always bound to be a catastrophe or two. Fingers crossed not too many of you guys started Krooppy Jr., but he is on the bench. That's catastrophe number one. I will read out the Bournemouth starting lineup. We've got Petravic, Trafair, Sness, Scott, Evan Olson's, Christy, Jimenez, Adley, Hill, Tooff, and Ryan. Uh, I've got Newcastle next and Gordy Gordon's back. Pope, Trippia, Botman, Gordon, Barnes, Cow, Elanga, Willick, Burn, Bruno G, and Ramsey, which means Hall is on the bench. Does anyone have Hall? Maybe another disaster. Mark says, \"I should have waited till a bit uh waited a bit before gifting. Save for the people who stay to the end.\" Yeah, maybe Mark. Maybe Mark. It doesn't matter. Maybe I'll gift. Can I gift? How do I gift? How to gift? Uh. I don't even know. I don't know how to gift. I'll figure out for next time and I'll I'll uh I'll gift. We'll do one each. Right. Anyway, yeah, looks like Anthony Gordon and the number nine again because there's no Whistler or Voltermard H. Um yeah, so there you go. Uh but yeah, Hall is the uh disaster catastrophe from Newcastle. Also, Croo Junior and Hall the most significant absentee so far. Next, we've got Everton and I've already seen a disaster. I'll read out the team. It's Pikford O'Brien, Topsy, Branwait, Micheleno, Ghana, Ghana. Two Garners, Adrisa, Ghana, Gay, and uh the other Ghana and Jai, Jhal, George. George is in and Barry and the there's one from every team. It's Keen. Keen is not in the Everton starting lineup. We did kind of know that Keen was circling the drain for that benching with Branweight and Michelenko available. So, um perhaps a little unfortunate but not entirely unexpected. Sean down with the super chat says, \"Fuming was at work and forgot to triple captain.\" Oh, man. Look, could be a blessing in disguise. Last week, someone sent me a message telling me that they accidentally left their captain's armbands on Palmer because they were at work or something. And what ended up happening was Arma scored 20 points and they wanted to move it to Bruno. So they're 10 points up because they made a mistake. It can happen Sean and it could happen to you. You never know. All right. Uh leads up next. We got Darlow, Bogle, Goodmanson, Roodon, Bhol, Borau, Justin, Aidu, Gruv, Aronson, and Meta. So, oh that guy earlier who said that there was a trusted leak of no Calbertt Leuen, they were spot on. We have our fourth um disaster I suppose for gameweek 26. One from each team. This leads one is Calbert Leuen, but like I guess um at least he's not in the squad, so you're going to get an auto sub there. So, not the worst. Queen of the Stone A says, \"Hello, Daniel. Triple captain breakdown on your videos was really helpful.\" So, thank you. I decided not to use the triple captain in the end. Very glad to hear it, my friend. I'm very glad to hear it. The the whole purpose of that was not to convince anyone to or to not triple captain, but just to uh help people understand their options so they can make their own decisions. I always trust people to make their own decisions. And any disasters here? Well, maybe. Maybe. Sanchez, Gusto, Ain Pong, Chalaba, Cukare, Kaisedo, Santos, Palmer, Enzo. Enzo in the 10 again. Estaval, Ja, Pedro, and on the bench. Do people still have Netto? Do people have I don't know who else is missing? Reese, James, not even in the squad. If anyone has uh Netto or James, then that's bad news there. Everything else looks reasonably good. Um, but I I wouldn't call that a disaster. These are real real fringe players. Not really too many FPL managers have these guys. So, we got our first team that really doesn't have any major absentees. Huzzah. Huzzah. And finally, actually, what we got? Shepsi says, \"Think it'll be Enzo left wing again and Steve right wing Palmer 10.\" Oh, yeah. It kind of was like that, wasn't it? Yeah, that makes sense. Interesting. But like I guess it's just like your attacking versus your defense shape which is probably going to be pretty different. So in attack Enzo drifts to the left. Palmer stays central. Estaval is not going to play on the left, is he? I've not seen him play. Estal can't play on the left, can he? I've never seen it happen. thoughts, opinions, and from uh Tottenham, Top Spur. From Top Spur, we have Vicario, Dragassin, Chavy, Bassuma, Grace, Salangi, Gallagher, Spence, Obear, Saw, and Vanderven, the captain. Vanderven is in. Um, who's missing? Romero we knew was missing. Helen, tell. No one has these guys. They're They're banging out the youth players again on the bench. Uh yeah, it won't be rigid. They'll change about. Steve is significantly worse than the left now. Fair enough. Cool. All right. Well, I'll uh I'll take your I'll definitely take your opinion on that one. Um yeah, Enzo on the left then. Calling Estabio Steve is mad. Yeah, I mean that's a fair fair comment. I quite like Steve. It's It's far more pedestrian, isn't it? What was it that they called as Pilqua? Was it Dave at Chelsea? Sometimes, you know, they like to they like to anglify the uh the names over at Chelsea FC. Uh but anyway, guys, so and yeah, no real disasters from Spurs or Chelsea. Major pieces of news is Calbert Leuen not in the squad. Keen on the bench. Uh Hall on the bench. Creepy Junior on the bench. I think most people will probably will have dodged all of those. I think I've dodged all of them. Um so yeah, I think it could be worse. I think that could be worse, couldn't it? It could be worse. Right guys, I think we can pretty much wrap things up. I'm not really feeling like sticking around uh for half an hour to see Manchester United naming an identical squad for the fourth consecutive week. Um Talking Drum says, \"Please advise me on Semeno. I own him, but not sure what to do. You could keep him for now.\" Um I don't see a reason to rush him out. Um JP starts just wish Palmer didn't. Yeah, maybe Palmer get another early bath, early sub. seems to be the trend. Um, yes guys, um, good luck this game week, particularly my fellow triple captains of the Gabrielle variety. Wishing you all the best of luck. Enjoy the midweek game week. Have fun. Enjoy and watch the footy. Chill out. I know I'll be chilling out for a few days. I'm not really going to kick back up with the videos again for a few days now because I really really I don't know. I want to wait for the FA Cup games this weekend really. So, I might take a couple of days off. Let's play some video games, watch some anime, and chill. It's quite nice. Valentine's Day this week as well. Not that I celebrate it, but um maybe I should. But yeah, guys, cheers. Um thank you for all the super chats and support and new members and everything like that. You guys are legends. Um as always, I'll catch you whenever I'm back making content, which will be probably in a few days now. Going to take a couple of days off to watch the football. Um so yeah, cheers guys. Enjoy and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye. Oh, oh, oh. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right. Oh. Heat. Heat."

      "transcript": "I asked 100 FBL experts for their gameweek 26 transfer plans, captains, and chip strategies so you guys can follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Hello and welcome to FPL Mate. [music] My name is Dan and welcome to the first double gameweek of the season. I can't believe it is finally here. I'm sure uh we're all very excited about this one. it could go crazy. And as such, we are going to be talking a lot about those uh those captains, those triple captains. We got some interesting stuff today, guys. Um so, we're going to be finding out about triple captains, how many of our experts will be playing them this week. We'll also be looking at who those triple captains and and indeed regular captains will be played on. And it's actually really interesting the uh kind of data we have for captains in particular. But we've got all kinds of stuff. We got transfers as well today, guys. So, stick around. Uh massive thank you to the 100 experts who have dedicated their uh their time to giving us their data again this week for 26. Right. Well, I think this is probably the best place to start. Transfers and chips. How many transfers are being made this week? And actually, this is a week where maybe you could consider rolling your transfer, making no transfer whatsoever because around half of our experts will be doing just that. But the majority will be making transfers, but only just. So 41% of our experts will be making one transfer in Game Route 26. 8% will be making two transfers and 2% will be making three or more transfers with one of our experts actually making four transfers this week. Nobody's using a wild card or free hit this week, but we do have some chips being played. 2% of our experts are using the bench boost. So I wouldn't really call that a trend necessarily, but maybe if your bench does look truly truly extraordinary, then maybe that's an argument to play the bench boost. But it's the triple captain that I'm sure we're really interested in here. And without a doubt, 38% of experts using their triple captain in this gameweek is a trend. That is a very strong trend. But it's not conclusive. 38% using a triple captain means that 62% of experts will not be using the triple captain. So technically um most experts are not using a triple captain chip this week. But at 38% that is a very very strong argument. and and that is a very high number indeed. So even though it's not maybe it's maybe not a case where you have to use your triple captainship this week, it is definitely a case where this is a very very strong option indeed. And actually, even at 38%, we may not see a higher number than that between now and the end of the season. Because if the triple captainship is maybe split between a couple of other gameweeks throughout the remainder of the season, 38% in one game week may actually end up being the highest percentage of experts using their triple captainship in one week that we will see for the remainder of the season. So, just wanted to put that one out there. Just because the majority of experts are not using the triple captain chip this week, that doesn't mean that this is automatically not the best week to use the triple captain chip if if that kind of makes sense to you guys. So huge number. I think if you are on or thinking about the triple captain chip, I think that is a large enough percentage of experts to maybe convince you to go for it. But if you are kind of maybe feeling a little cooler on the triple captainship, and by the way guys, if you haven't checked out yesterday's video, my team selection video, we talked about the triple captainship for like 15 minutes. That was like half the video was just triple captain talk. So go check that out if you just want more information about what the other options might be. But yeah, I think really this is maybe not as convincing as maybe a lot of you guys were hoping for. Maybe you maybe wanted to see a 50% plus here. Unfortunately, you're not going to see that. But the trends are significant, guys. And I and I think, you know, that is certainly, you know, it's given me some confidence to pull the trigger. I don't know about you guys, but it's giving me some confidence. It's it's enough for me. Um, but you guys will have to make your own judgment whether it's enough for you to convince you. Let's check out the transfer trends from the overall player base before we go to the expert transfers and and indeed who will be triple captain. And uh yeah, it's one of those weeks where actually the overall player base is not aligned with the experts in terms of the transfer ideas that they have. Really, we are seeing very very uh little correlation between what most FPL managers seem to be doing and what the experts seem to be doing. And in fact, the only player in the top 10 uh most popular transfers in the overall player base that our experts also are strongly transferring in this week is going to be Yurian Timber. Outside of that, there are some transfers in for Declan Rice. There are a couple of transfers in for David Ryer. But outside of that, Jockarez, Bruno, Zuba Mendes, Joel Pedro, and Burmo Palmer Gabrielle. There are no transfers in for any of those. And there are different reasons for that. First of all, players like Bruno Fernandez and Gabrielle in particular. These are two players that are owned by near enough all experts at this point anyway. So yeah, if they weren't, then I'm sure we would see more transfers for them. But outside of that, there's some players who maybe have a little bit of ownership among experts. You know, Burmo is like at 35 40% ownership among experts. Joel Pedro is maybe at 15% ownership. Palmer's maybe at some like 8% ownership among experts. So, still nobody looking to transfer these players in, but at least, you know, some a lot a lot of experts or at least a decent amount of experts have these players already. And then there's other players such as Jockz and Zubendi who make up two of the top three most popular transfers. uh in the overall player base and not only do our experts barely own these players, nobody has Zubendy, I think maybe one or two have Yokarez in their team, but nobody is looking to bring these guys in either. So, we are seeing a a major split here. Yokarez, Zub Mendy, overall player base love these guys. Experts clearly don't like these guys as FPL picks and and really do fancy some of the other Arsenal picks and rate the other Arsenal picks much higher than Yokarez and Zuma Mendy. And there's been a lot of questions this week about Zub Mendy in in my comments. Strangely large amount really. Um, as an Arsenal fan, I I'm not convinced at all by Zub Mendy as an FPL pick. He has scored in the last couple of games, but buying him expecting him to score like these worldy banger goals every single game week. It's just not realistic for him to keep scoring these goals. Ultimately, he is a defensive midfielder. usually he just takes the role of a defensive midfielder and you know doesn't actually get defensive contributions that often considering his deep position. So in general I don't really like Super Mendy as an as an FPL pick. Um particularly because going for him also sacrifices another Arsenal player who could be much much stronger. So that is my opinion on Zub Mendy. I know this video is not usually meant to be about my opinions but because there has been so many Zub Mendy questions I thought this would probably be the best time to answer them. Now, um we are going to be talking about some Arsenal differentials when we come to the um the bonus questions in the video. So, stay tuned for that. We will be talking a little bit more about some of these guys. But, uh yeah, uh for now, let's just stick with what the experts are actually doing this week. So, what the experts are actually doing is uh is selling Dorgu. Yes. Uh so, here are the transfers out, guys. We have seen in recent game weeks that experts have kind of been holding on to Dorgu quite a lot and just leaving him on the bench, but the transfers out for him are picking up. And I think a big part of that is the fact that uh there are more defenders that are looking like good options now. And certainly in the last few game weeks, there's not really been a good jumping on point for a lot of the defenders that we've been looking at. Now we're kind of coming into a place where teams particularly like Crystal Palace and Bournemouth maybe have really nice fixtures and you can just pick some nice cheap or expensive defenders from those teams. So now is a good time to make defender transfers because their options have have certainly grown. Uh there's more options to go for right now that look more convincing than maybe they may have a couple of weeks ago for example. So Dorgu is being sold six transfers out for him. Chiao is being sold six transfers out for him. Um among other defenders we see O'Reilly, Tarovski, Hall there as well. There also some midfielders being transferred out here. Enzo Lefay, three transfers out for him. Lewis Miley, a bit of an injury there. Few transfers out for him. Garner and Jai and Enzo just a couple of transfers out for for Enzo. Majority of experts will be keeping him, but he is another player mentioned in the bonus questions today. In general, I have to be honest with you guys, the transfer out trends in particular this game week, they're not particularly trendy. there. The trends are pretty weak. And actually, even though you see 10 players on this list, there were another maybe five players being transferred in out by maybe two experts each and and then another 20 25 players being transferred out by one expert each. So really what I saw in the data this week was a real spread of loads of different players, often differential players that are being transferred out this week, lowowned players. So, I think this is maybe one of those weeks where you remove maybe some of those players who you're not totally convinced by. Maybe you have them in your team and you don't really see them in many other people's teams. Those are the kind of players that look like the the kind of primary candidates for transfers out this week. Just those random players that you just have in your team. You've had them in your team for a while. You're just waiting for an opportunity to get rid of them. Now is maybe the chance to do exactly that. So, those are your kind of transfers out kind of trends, I guess. And the trend is that there isn't much trend. Just remove players that you're not happy with. It's is the simple answer. I know. If only FPL was that easy every single game week, right guys? But hopefully these videos are making FPL easier. And if they are, make sure you do drop a like. It really is appreciated. And do subscribe if you're new around here as well to follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Right, transfers in, guys. And we have some trendier trends. Yes, we've got a little bit more information here. And I think we can gather a little bit more from this one. So, first of all, Daniel Manoz, great first name, by the way. We do like a Daniel. Um, yeah, 5.8 million defender. A little expensive, but plays Burnley and Wolves in the next two. Really, really nice fixtures indeed. 13 of our experts will be taking the risk, the punt on the high upside Crystal Palace defender. So, he was barely owned by anyone last game week. So, we're seeing some real nice interest in him. And that is a a fairly decent number and a fairly decent trend particularly for a player who is is ultimately differential. He is a player that nobody really had last game week. And we're seeing similar numbers for Isa 11 transfers in for the Crystal Palace midfielder. He's just 6.3 million by the way guys. We expect him to be on penalties probably but not definitely. And um yeah just looks like a really really nice pick given the fixtures and given the form as well. You know scoring in in backto-back games now for Crystal Palace. really nice indeed for that kind of price tag. Outside of that, we're maybe looking at some more Arsenal players. If you haven't got your Timber in your team yet, you need to get that third Arsenal player, then what are you waiting for? The double game week is right now, so make sure you got that Arsenal triple up and Timber is the most transferred in of those Arsenal players this game week with players like Gabrielle and Rice already incredibly heavily owned. So maybe Timberidge maybe that third guy for a lot of experts. Um, the James Hill gang grows. Five new transfers in for James Hill. He's going to be up to 17% ownership among experts. The 3.9 million cheat code. Yeah, I'm so glad people are finally coming around to James Hill. We're going to see his ownership grow with each week. I think Declan Rice, four new transfers in for him to add to his 73 existing owners. Four new transfers in for Richards. Three new transfers in for Mané. And just a couple of transfers in for players such as Rya Anderson and Joel Gomez who is a little bit of a differential defcon kind of midfielder who plays for Wolves. Maybe some experts looking to get a nice eight-pointer from him in gameweek 26. So those are your transfers in but there is more to talk about today. For example, the template which technically hasn't changed this game week. So um no change in the goalkeepers really a small increase for Rehea in terms of the defenders. Gabrielle still flying high here. Timber up a 7% there up to 63% ownership. So yeah, he is a heavily owned player among experts. And it and it kind of looks like looking through these numbers that our experts will typically own Gabrio and Rice and then one of Rya and Timber. I mean that it's not strictly like that necessarily, but that's what the majority of experts are kind of running as their kind of Arsenal triple up right now, which is why we are seeing four Arsenal players in in the template as the kind of most popular players um that uh that you can kind of get. But certainly Rya are the least popular of those four. I guess the template for I suppose you could call them. Um outside of that, um small decrease for Chalaban, but not really much else change in defense. Um the only changes in midfield were was a little bit of increased ownership for Rice and Burmo and a little bit of a decrease for Enzo. And in the forward position, not much increase or decrease really here either. Small change for Echitique, but that's just about it. So the template has not really changed. A lot of the players that are being brought in are kind of differential players um to to be totally honest with you guys who aren't necessarily going to go straight into the template and we might have to wait another week or two before seeing them in these kind of uh these kind of pages. But anyway guys, no real change on the template. So yeah, hopefully that's all cool with you guys. Average Gameweek 25 score is 70.1 points. Let me know if you beat that score or not. Pretty decent score for the experts. Again, another big green arrow. And the average rank is up to 333,000th in the world. 82% of our experts are in the top 1 million, 22% in the top 100K, and 2% in the top 10K. Although given that it is chip season now, and there the fact that the experts are so unaligned with the overall player base transfers this week, I think that this could maybe get even better by the time we come to next week's video. To be honest with you guys, suggested transfers. If you haven't already got Yuri Timber or your I guess your third Arsenal player, then that's your priority move. So if you got someone like Chiao, got someone like O'Reilly, just any defender where you can afford to make the upgrade to Timber and you haven't done so already, just do it. If not, Daniel Munoz if you've already got your Arsenal player, Daniel Moz if you can go expensive or someone like Hill if you need to go a little bit cheaper at 3.9 million. If you've got a midfielder who you don't really like right now, the first player to get is Declan Rice, that third Arsenal player if you haven't done it already. And if not, you're going to be looking at SR. You're going to be looking at uh, you know, selling someone for Sara. I guess there's not really any other midfielders that are sticking out as transfers in this game. Don't think any of these players are really worth a hit necessarily other than maybe the Arsenal guys because getting your Arsenal sorted really is super important as we're going to find out when we come to the captains next where all of the captains this week come from Arsenal. And I say all of the captains, I mean both of the captains. And I think this is uh this is so useful for so many of the comments that I've been getting on on YouTube videos and on Tik Tok and on Instagram. So many people kind of questioning is Gabrielle really the best captain to go for? Like surely there are better options. Should I go for Rice? Can I go for Zendi? Should I go for Yarez? Well, let me tell you 100% of Gabrielle owners among experts will be captaining him this week. 97 captained, 97 owned, 100% captain hit rate. So, I I I don't really know how to kind of justify this anymore. We've spoken a lot about Gabrielle in uh in some of the other videos this week about how important he is, particularly in yesterday's video when we were talking about the triple captain and the triple captain on Gabrielle. Um so, go check that out if you want the full lowdown. But if you just want to take the expert's word for it, then it's very conclusive. It really is to to see that all Gabrielle owners are captaining him is nothing short of remarkable in terms of uh in terms of trying to get you know a definitive answer because that's what these these videos are really for. Is there expert consensus on anything? Do our experts prefer certain things? There is a complete consensus on this. So no doubt about it. And the only people who are not going to be captaining Gabrielle this week among those top managers really are going to be people who don't have Gabrielle. And in that case, maybe they go for Declan Rice. So 97 captains on Gabrielle, which is one of the highest numbers we have seen in the history of the 100 expert series, which has been running for four years now, and 3% just three going for Declan Rice. I don't even know if we've ever had a situation where 100% of owners are captaining one player, particularly not at these kind of numbers at least. So yeah, very conclusive. If you have Gabrielle, captain him. Um if you don't then Declan Rice is your probably your best second best option. I I don't know I guess. Um in terms of those triple captains, well uh obviously we have 38 triple captainers this gameweek. And I can tell you that all but one of them will be triple captaining Gabrielle. So that's 37 triple captains on Gabrielle and one triple captain on Deckham Rice. And again, I believe that is because that person doesn't own Gabrielle and and they're still looking to triple cap him in gameweek 26 and don't feel it's worth making switches around for, you know, an existing triple up on Arsenal to get Gabrielle in their team. So yeah, um I think this is really really useful for anyone who has kind of been on the fence or kind of secondguessing or doubting some decision- making. You can't do much better than this in terms of looking for um kind of validation on a certain move. And uh yeah, what can I say guys? Gabriel captain at the very least is the way and triple captain is also very much on the cards if you fancy going that way. With that said guys, we have got some bonus questions uh to kind of answer some of the things you have been asking this week. So bonus questions. The first question I asked our experts in the private uh Discord server was, is Enzo Palmer worth the upgrade? A few of you guys have been asking that this week. Uh 77% of our experts say no, it's not worth the upgrade. Just save your transfer. Save it for a rainy day, use it uh for something else this week, whatever. And 23% say yes, it is worth it, but only as a free move, for free transfer. So if you have money on the bank in the bank already and you can make a simple upgrade from Enzo to Palmer, then 23% of experts say do that, but most say don't. uh in terms of using a minus four to move Enzo to Palmer or indeed getting Palmer at all really. Um nobody's nobody is suggesting taking hits to to get Palmer into their team. So yeah, that would be the expert advice on that particular question with regards to Palmer who is of course so very popular this week among I guess non-experts. I suppose the other question was now I don't know if you guys watched last week's episode of the 100 experts but I basically asked which of these uh kind of arsenal differentials would you consider going for but I also included none as an answer and 80% of our experts said none. So, uh, what I thought I'd do this week is I would force my experts to pick an Arsenal differential because I know a lot of you guys you you've seen the template for Rya, Gabrielle, Timber, Rice, and you're still saying, \"I don't care if they're template. I don't care if they're popular. I don't care if the experts like them. I want something a little bit spicy in my team.\" And you know what? Totally fair enough. Um, if you're having more fun going differential and you know there are plenty of times where I've had a great time in FPL going differential, then you should absolutely do it and you should back yourself and you should go with uh what you feel most strongly about rather than you know necessarily just going boring all the time. I totally get it. So I forced the experts to pick a differential for you guys out of the following options. Yarez, Zubendy, Celiba, Havits, Califuri, Madaw Trosard, Gabrielle Jesus and Martinelli. you were forced to answer experts and 39% said Jockz is the best of these Arsenal differentials to go for and indeed he is the most popular in the overall player base as well. So if you are fancying going a little bit different Yokarez would be your guy. Celiba is in second place here 28% so you know maybe going for that triple up in the Arsenal defense potentially there could be really really interesting. Um and maybe Celiba is going to be part of that triple up. If so amazing. Um 11% said Zubame Mendy, 11% said Madawekke. So despite the the the high popularity of Zub Mendi, I could only convince 11% of experts to say that they would go for him and only if they were forced to. So uh yeah, that tells you all you need to know there. 6% would say Hav 6% said Trosard. Nobody said Califury, Trosard, or Martinelli. All considered too high risk for this gameweek. So there we go guys. If you do desperately want to go for a differential, go for Yokarez. Maybe go for Celiba. But I cannot stress enough, the true expert advice is to go for none of these guys and to stick with three out of Rya, uh, Gabrielle, Timber, and Rice. Three out of those four. That is what the experts are truly saying. So, there we go. But still interesting stuff and we make these videos to hopefully be a little bit interesting. Let me know if there are any other final questions before the deadline today, guys. Do drop a like. Do subscribe if you like this video as well. We'll be back for a deadline stream this afternoon. A couple of hours before deadline, we will be live on this YouTube channel answering more of your questions. So, make sure you join me there. Looking forward to seeing a few of you guys there. And I will [music] see you later, mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "Gameweek 26 is here and whilst we look at a potential triple captain this week, we also need to make some transfers as well. So, there are so many big decisions to be made this week as we lock in for FPL gameweek 26. Welcome to FPL, mate. My name is Dan, guys. A nice green arrow for me in game me 25. I would call it maybe a cheeky little green arrow because nothing enormous here, but we are edging ever closer to the uh the fabled top 100k that uh I'm desperate to get in nice and early this season ahead of chip season. So, this is what we're looking at, guys. 73 points scored in game 25. Let me know how you guys did as well. Rehea and Gabrielle doing the business with a clean sheet. Hill. James Hill. Nobody had heard of him a couple of weeks ago, but we picked him up and he is doing so so well for that 3.9 million back-to-back seven-pointers this week with Defcon and an assist. Bruno captain worked out well and Burmo pretty nice as well with the goal there. Declan Rice with the Defcon as with Anderson. Harland coming through with an assist and a penalty goal. And Ekit, how he didn't return against Man City, I have no idea. But at least his underlying numbers are continuing to be really really good and we will talk about that. But most of all guys, I want to talk about today um a little bit about transfers, but mostly about triple captain. So, let's get involved with that guys because it is such a big decision to be made. And if you need some good luck ahead of gameweek 26, some good karma, make sure you do drop a like on the video to follow along with my team. Feel free to subscribe as well. We do this every week. So, I have one free transfer, 3.2 million in the bank, all backlogged from that Sacka to Rice transfer from last week. Let's see what we're dealing with right now. We do have Rya in goal for his double gameweek. Nice guaranteed minutes there. Him actually outscoring Timber last gameweek. I wonder if that can happen again. Ryer actually in fairness has been doing just as well if not better than Timber in recent weeks. In defense, we've got the Arsenal defensive double up with Gabrielle though looking pretty nice there. Looking pretty smart there. And we've got Malik Chow and Hill here as well. Chia has been a continual disappointment over the last three game weeks. In fairness, I haven't started him every week, but I would probably be looking to start him against Spurs this week. Um, if I keep him, that is. And that is another conversation. Hill, on the other hand, against Everton, I'm pretty happy about him. I'm pretty happy about his defcon potential, and I'm just going to pretty much play him every week, I think. Well, at least most weeks for the upcoming gameweeks because Bournemouth really do look like they're improving defensively. And, uh, yeah, Defcon Hill is now kind of the second best over a six gamewe period. Hill is the second best def corner in the entire league among defenders. Only strike at leads is doing better than Hill right now. So insane defcon corn connor some assist potential apparently. And uh yeah I think clean sheets are going to be become more and more common as we go through the gameweeks. On my bench guys I do have Tvka. No way I'm starting him ahead of the double gameweek Rya. We've got Collins against Arsenal. Alderate against Liverpool. Obie just there as a a placeholder really. And we've got really a situation where I don't know who I'm going to put as my first backup defender. I'm keeping a close eye on Collins because I'm not sure what his kind of situation is with whether he's going to start starting games again. We need to keep an eye on press conferences for that one if he is out of favor or if he is going to start playing or not. Um I can give him this week at least. I don't need to make a transfer on him necessarily. But if something did come out and there's maybe some kind of issue with Collins at the moment and it looks unlikely that he'll play longterm, then maybe I do need to reconsider Collins and maybe he'll be a priority transfer out this week. But I think we can give it one more week. We can give it another round or two of press conferences and hopefully get more information on that one. Alder arguably needs to go above Collins on my bench as well at home against Liverpool. We know Sunderland can be a very tricky opposition um when they do play at home uh against any team pretty much. So um yeah, interesting one there. Maybe I do need to put Alder first on the bench, but we'll have to wait and see there. Looking through the clean sheet odds for my defenders this week, guys. And um I've got here uh I've taken this from Solio because Rob T hasn't posted at time of recording. Um we see Arsenal, of course, are going to be on top here. 38% chance of a clean sheet against Brenford, 51% chance of a clean sheet against Wolves, giving them a total projected clean sheet of 0.89. So I think we're looking at one clean sheet is probably, you know, realistic. one of out of the two games, we'll probably see a clean sheet. Um, outside of that, we do have some other teams genuinely with decent chances. Crystal Palace and Man City, for example, really, really nice numbers here. Uh, Crystal Palace at home against Burnley, uh, I'm definitely interested in that. Man City, Nottingham Forest, if you guys have players from those teams, pretty nice. As with Liverpool against Sunderland, 37%. Uh, even Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Man United looking pretty good. Maybe people expected Chelsea to be a little higher on this list, but Chelsea just not been super strong defensively. I'm looking at some of my other defenders. Uh we've got Hill 24% chance of a clean sheet against Everton, but I think uh the the markets haven't quite adjusted to Bournemouth who seemingly are improving defensively and uh 26% on Newcastle. Again, have the markets adjusted towards Newcastle seemingly incapable of keeping a clean sheet at the moment? It's looking pretty rough for them. So, those are your kind of clean sheet odds. And I think that does kind of back up why I've got kind of a Sunderland defender on the bench and a Brenford defender on the bench. Both of those have 17% uh chance of a clean sheet against their teams, which is pretty low to be fair. Pretty low indeed. So, I think I'm happy with the defenders I have on field, although maybe a transfer is needed because outside of the Arsenal guys, um none of my defenders have good clean sheet odds this week. And the plan always was originally to make a defender transfer this week to try and just improve my chances, improve my odds of of picking up a clean sheet and indeed defensive contributions as well because which is um you know super important to the way I'm playing FPL this season. Let's look at my midfield guys. Bruno and Burmo, Rice, Enzo, and Anderson. Not too much needs to be said about Bruno. I think he's just going to be a set and forget captain in those non double game weeks, if that makes sense. Looking really strong every week with so many ways of getting points. and Burmo um potentially picked up a little knock. He was seen limping out of the out of the stadium um in gameweek 25. So, small concerns there. Uh but I think he he has trained today and I think he's trained just fine. So, I think is going to be fine to play this week, but I just wanted to flag it up with you guys that there is maybe a tiny bit of concern about him kind of limping out the stadium like wondering what's going on there. Was it just cramp, a little bit of soreness? Is it just a knock with the game in a couple of days? Is there a a small chance of him being rested, rotated, whatever? And I think there is a very small chance, but I'm very much leaning towards Burmo playing and I'm not going to really action it unless there is something said in press conferences. I'm not going to, you know, sell and Burma or anything like that unless unless something big comes out, which I don't think it will. Delin Rice looks good for this gameweek. Defcon is back and with him playing a little bit of a a deeper role in gameweek 25, it could be that he is going to be more of a defcon um midfielder for the next couple of gameweeks. I mean, if he can get a nine-pointer from some defcon and um you know, two games played, then that's going to be pretty nice. But that said, being on set pieces, being on free kicks, being on corners, you never know when you're going to get the big hall. Just ask Dominic Soaslai who's got a few uh corner assist, well, mostly free kick goals recently as well, hasn't he? That could be Declan Rice next. We know that that Arsenal really alongside Manchester United with the Bruno and Burmo taking the the corners there are the set piece masters of the league. Enzo still looks good. Really good underlying numbers. Really unfortunate not to get any attacking returns last game week um against Wolves. He had had actually had much better non-penalty uh kind of expected numbers than Palmer and in infinitely better than Joel Pedro who pretty much just won two penalties and did nothing else the whole game in terms of FPL uh contributions. I'm talking of course. So Enzo I still think looks really really strong. Um the the difference between him and Palmer literally just came down to a bit of luck, bit of penalty and you know sometimes that can be an 18 point swing apparently. But yeah, that's just FPL for you guys. There's no guarantee that it's going to happen the same way this week. Though I have no real interest in upgrading Enzo to Palmer or anything like that. Some of you guys maybe will and maybe you'll value those penalties a little bit more. You'll value Palmer a little bit more. But for for me, Enzo numbers still look really good. Minutes still look really good. Still going to be on penalties when Palmer is off the pitch. Still going to have set piece share. Particularly with James injured. I'm still, you know, not really looking to sell him. And Anderson, the Defcon guy. Four points in gameweek 25. Could it be four points, five points in gameweek 26? The clean sheet odds are pretty good, so we could see a nice five-pointer for him. You never know. Could get some bonus as well given he is so busy on the pitch. Harland and Ekit are my two forwards. Maybe some confidence renewed in Harland because he scored a penalty. Yes, I know guys. Uh but the 11pointer I think will at least kind of calm the questions down about whether Harland is a cell or not. We did mention last game week Harland isn't a cell because there's not really any better options right now if you're not worried about money. He's still on penalties and the fixtures still look good. Um, you know, proof is in the pudding in gaming week 25. I think I'm just going to continue to own Harland unless, you know, something changes in terms of me needing money for something. It's just not really the case right now. And Ekit still really happy with him in terms of his performances. He's getting chances to score. He's looking really hot. And kind of if we go through some of these numbers, guys, over the past six game weeks, and this is uh a table of the past six game weeks, and we've got expected goal involvements per start. Um, we've excluded low minutes players. We've got Harland second here with 0.8 expected goal involvements per start in the past six game weeks. Really good. Enzo really high with Bruno 0.7 each. Very nice. And Burma 0.5, Rice 0.4. So, you know, even though people have kind of been down on Rice recently, it's mostly his creativity. Looks looks really strong right now. If we switch this and include players who are have low minutes as well, which would include someone like Egyp who's only started three of the last six due to injury problems. Um he's actually top of this list. So one expected goal involvements per start. Every time he starts he's expected to get one goal involvement because his xG numbers are just so high. 0.81 xG per start. That's for a non- penalty taker. Absolutely incredible. And 0.2 to expected assists per start as well in this I guess small period of games. But even across the season and we're going to see a little later on uh Ecatik's numbers whenever he starts are phenomenal. So you can forget this just being a small sample size. He is just a player with fantastic numbers and always has opportunities to score goals and sometimes to get assists as well. And I think that is going to really um improve when we get to some of these nicer fixtures after Sunderland which I think is a little bit of a tricky one. Forest may be tricky after that. amazing. The fixtures are really good for Liverpool and Echitique. So, I'm looking forward really to seeing what he can produce next. So, guys, let's talk about transfers. First of all, um I need a new defender. I think that's my priority. I'm not 100% sure I'm I'm going to do it. I could just keep Malik Chow in the defense and not make any other changes because I think my attack looks really good. I'm happy with the attack right now, at least for this game, week where I might be looking to make some changes in game 27, but for now, looks good. Um, in defense, I'm not totally convinced. I've already mentioned that my clean sheet odds outside of the Arsenal guys, not particularly high. Chia, not particularly high. Hill I have more confidence in to be fair. So, one of Chiao or Collins probably needs to go. Chiao is probably going to be the guy who I sell because I think he's probably going to drop in price soon and I'm very tight for budget when it comes to my transfer plans that we will talk about. So, right now, the player I'm looking at is a actually going to be a downgrade. I want to free up some money so I could eventually do Rice to Verts and Obi to Thiago to fill out my squad with players ready for blank gameweek 31. So that's going to be really really nice if I can manage to do that. But we need to free up just a little bit more money in order to do that in the coming gameweek. So what are we going to do? Who are we going to downgrade Malik Sha to? Well, look no further than Chris Riches. Now, I feel like I've been fairly good at picking out defenders this season, going ahead of the crowd and picking some players that are not really too many pe other people are going for. We've done Hill, we've done Collins, we've done Shia, we've found some success in all three of these guys recently. But the OG defender that I kind of I guess scouted in a way. I'm sure many of you you guys managed to scout him as well individually, independently. Um but but yeah, the first player I scouted this season was Chris Richards who looked like a really nice differential option under 1% owned at the start of the season, 4.5 million. Well, now he's 4.4 million. Still the one of the greatest defconers in the league. So defensive contributions really nice and he has his two very best fixtures for clean sheets he will have in the entire season in the next two game weeks. Burnley at home, Wolves at home. You there is no two better fixtures if you're looking for clean sheets in the Premier League. This is really really amazing stuff and I think we've just got to just got to go for it. If you need a defender for the next two game weeks and maybe a few game weeks beyond that because we also do have Richard with leads at home in gameweek 30 which I could think could be nice playable in 29 against Spurs away. Um to be fair like because he's a death corner he can be played pretty much any gameweek and it's not like he plays any like Arsenals or Liverpools or Man cities anytime soon or anything like that. And yes, he is going to be blanking in gameweek 31. But actually, because of my specific transfer plans and the way I've kind of set up my team, even if I did have too many uh too many like uh players who blank in 31, and I won't, I would still have an additional four transfers to fix it after that or three transfers to fix it after that. So, I I'm not in a position where I need to worry really about picking up players who don't play in 31 right now because I'm pretty light really and I already have plans to kind of fix a lot of these things anyway. And by the time I get to game at 31, I'll either just bench Richers and I'll still have a starting 11 or I'll sell him to someone like Anderson um at Fulham who plays against Burnley that week. Um that's a little far in in the future, guys, to be honest. But yeah, I think Riches works really well for my team. recovers me for the next two game weeks really well whilst we can continue to assess the Collins situation. Meanwhile, Alder is also going to be available as a potential play next week. Hill is a good play every single game week as is Gabrielle. So, I think this will really really sort out my defense. Um, you know, which is maybe starting to show a little bit of a few cracks this gameweek that that definitely could be improved upon. So, yeah, shout to Richards. Uh, that looks like the move. It just looks like the move. So, with that said, guys, with the transfer done, I I did say that I wanted to spend a little bit of time today on triple captain talk because I think this is probably the biggest topic of the day. It really is. And a lot of you guys will be wondering, shall I pull the trigger on the triple captain? And I think it's really important to know kind of what the alternatives are. You know, if if we're going for triple captain against Gabrielle or in Gabrielle this week, for example, what are the other options? you know, what are we missing out on if we go for it this week essentially is what I'm trying to say. And is it actually worth waiting? Well, let's go through that right now, guys. So, let's start off right here. And this is a table of players and their points per start in the Premier League so far this season. And we see an a nice clear top three here. Harland 7.54 uh points per start this this season. He's only just overtaken literally this game he's only just overtaken Gabrielle who was on 7.44 points per start. So prior to uh the hall from Harland in gameweek 25, Gabrielle was actually on top here. In third place we have Bruno Fernandez a little bit further behind at 6.41 points per start. Um by the way shout out to Ecadik who is in fourth place. Six points per start. I told you guys he is a good pick. You just got to you just got to start games. Uh he will get opportunities. There are some other players who are pretty high hit as well, but I think there's not really too much point in looking outside of Harland, Gabrielle, and Bruno. I think these are the three standout players in the Premier League this season when you're looking to get yourself some nice FPL points. So, what we need to do next is kind of identify double game weeks. We know Gabrielle has a double gameweek in gameweek 26 right now, but what about the other guys? What are these kind of double game weeks going to look like? Can we beat Gabrielle against uh Brenford and Wolves? Can we do better than that? Well, let's let's have a look. So, let's uh take a look at this double gameweek table, guys. I update this regularly throughout the season, and this is my predictions for the double when the double game weeks are going to be and also what the double game will be as well for each team. So, we need to look at Manchester United first of all, and and kind of talk about Bruno. And there is only one scenario in which Manchester United can get a double game this season or at least one likely scenario realistic scenario because likely is is uh pushing it a little bit. And the only way it can happen is if Brenford reach the semifinals of the FA Cup. If Brenford reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, they will very likely have their fixture from gameweek 34 against Manchester United moved into gameweek 33, creating a Manchester United double gameweek of Chelsea away and Brenford at home. So, that is the best realistic way we're looking at Manchester United getting a double gameweek this season. The problem is, of course, with that is number one, um, we've got to get Brenford to the FA Cup semi-finals first. And I don't know how likely that is. Don't get me wrong, it's possible, but are we going to be counting on that happening? I don't know. It's it's really risky. We have a double gameweek right now. Are we really going to bet on Manchester United maybe getting a double gameweek when it's not even guaranteed? I don't know. The second problem is that gameweek 33 looks so much better for a bench boost or a free hit. Because it's going to be the largest double gameweek of the season, we need to use our chips that really benefit having a large amount of double game weeks. With the triple captain chip, you only need one team. I mean, it's technically not possible. You have to have two teams, but you only need one team to have a double game week and suddenly you've got a scenario where actually is possible for one only one team to have a double game. That's a whole other tangent. Um, it is technically possible, but anyway, um, you only need one team to have a double game week in order to use the triple captainship because the chip is focused on just one player. Whereas your free hit and your bench boost, a large amount of double game weeks, that is where you see the real benefit of those chips. So gameweek 33 for me is going to be a bench boost week with gameweek 34 is going to be my free hit week. I'm confident about this strategy, really confident, and we will be doing another chip strategy video very soon where we'll be talking a little bit more, narrowing things down a little bit more and exploring maybe some alternatives. But for me, I can't see a world in which I don't use either the bench boost or free hit in gameweek 33. They're just so much more going to be so much more effective in the biggest double game week of the season which should see around eight teams double. So triple captain for gameweek 33 is just ruled out for me. It's not happening. I'm sorry. It's just it's not happening. So we need to look at any possible double gameweeks outside of gameweek 33. Is there anything else that's possible? And there is. There is indeed. So, one thing about the fact that uh the Man City versus Crystal Palace game has been moved out of gameweek 31 and it's not been rescheduled into gameweek 26 just because of cup clashes or or you know clashes with uh Crystal Palace playing in the Europa Conference League. Um you know they they're not available to play in the midweek of 26 27. So, the most likely uh places where this Crystal Palace game against Man City will be kind of placed is either gameweek 33 or gameweek 36. It's going to be one of those two. So, we are going to see most likely, you know, like 99% we're going to see at least one Manchester City double game week this season. One of which will be uh somewhere with, you know, Crystal Palace going in somewhere whether that's 33 or 36. So, we could see Arsen uh we could see Man City against Arsenal and Crystal Palace in 33. We kind of already ruled that out. Or most likely gameweek 36 where we'd see Burn Brenford uh at home and Crystal Palace at home potentially there as well. Could also be gameweek 35. That's a whole other thing. But one of gameweek 35 or 36 will be that second double gameweek for Man City because we also have the FA Cup scenario. So if one of Manchester City or Burnley reached the FA Cup semi-final and I'd say that's much more likely than Brenford reach Brenford in isolation reaching the FA Cup semi-finals then that is going to create that second double gameweek. That is going to mean that not only will we need fixtures rescheduling into gameweek 33 but we'll also need that fixture as we mentioned rescheduled into 35 or 36. So, it's basically going to be either Crystal Palace or Burnley are going to be the kind of additional fixture for Man City in most likely gameweek 36, possibly gameweek 35. So, if we're looking at kind of triple captain opportunities there, you're looking at Harland really against uh if if it's gameweek 36, it's going to be against Brenford at home and one of Burnley or Crystal Palace or maybe and less likely gameweek 35 Everton away and again one of Crystal Palace or Burnley. We don't know which one it's going to be. It kind of depends what happens. I think it's more likely it will be Burnley put in there to be honest. So, that is what a Man City and that's what a Harland uh double game week could look like. So, we got Arsenal, we got Gabrielle against Brenford and Wolves. Or we've got the possibility of uh Harland against one of Everton or Brenford and then one of Burnley or Crystal Palace. That maybe looks a bit better with Harland. Do you guys agree? I don't know, maybe you will, maybe you won't, but maybe that looks a little bit better, the Harland option. Um because those are nice fixtures, particularly if Burnley gets put in there. That's really nice indeed. But there are three problems with the Harland triple captain in that kind of gameweek 36/game35 kind of area. The first problem is we don't actually know it will happen. Of course it is likely that Man City or Burnley do reach the FA Cup semi-final, more likely Man City, sorry Burnley fans. But that is pretty likely, but it's not guaranteed. And if it doesn't happen, well then there's no double game week in 35 or 36 for Man City. It just doesn't happen. then you're pretty much going to have to commit to using a triple captain on a single game week unless some of the kind of outlier kind of chances of some more double game weeks maybe in 36 or 37 do come true because there are still some other possibilities. There are still some other possibilities and we'll talk about them and we'll explore them later on when we do the next chip strategy video. Um there are some other opportunities but if we're looking at Harland specifically is this game 36 you want really or maybe game 35 that's what you want from him. So, it's not guaranteed to happen, but it's likely to happen. Next problem. Okay. What if Harland gets injured? If Harland gets injured, would you be as comfortable doing a triple captain on a Marmoo or a uh Bill Foden or a Ryan Chery? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. So, maybe Semeno to be fair. Maybe Semeno. But would you be as comfortable if you know Harland got an injury at some point between now and in literally months time? We're talking like two and a half, three months. This is we're talking like May before the next d this uh this double next triple captain opportunity is going to be like April May kind of time. So we're talking months in advance. So would you be comfortable if Harland got injured captaining a different Man City player? Maybe, maybe not. And the third problem is what about rotation? So say Man City are in the FA Cup kind of semifinals. They're in they're going far in the Champions League as well. They've got all of these fixtures in all of these competitions that they're competing for. What if Harland needs a rest against a team like Burnley in gameweek 36? Because gameweek 37 will be just a couple of days after. So, will it be prime time to rest someone like Harland in what is maybe on paper an easier fixture where Marmush could do a pretty good job there if he was required to? Maybe. So we could see that Harland is maybe rotation risk later in this in the season, particularly if Manchester United are still competing in other competitions and particularly even more if maybe Man City are out of the title race because there is a scenario in which Man City are out of the title race by gameweek 36 or at least the second game of gameweek 36 and as such just completely prioritize other competitions and you know in that case Harland really high chance of of being arrested. So, lots of variables there with the Harland triple captain potential. Lots of variables indeed. And I think it really comes down to your appetite. So, just to just to reframe it in a nice and simple way, you are looking at either Gabrielle right now, you know, he's fit, he's available, he is likely to start both games against Brenford and Wolves. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. Not I don't want to say it looks perfect, but it looks pretty good. The other alternative realistically kind of that looks kind of, you know, convincing right now as a realistic possibility is Harland against probably Brenford in gamewick 36 and one of Burnley or Crystal Palace, more likely Burnley in my opinion. The Man City one, the Harland one, it looks better, but it comes with significant risks. When you put all of the risk factors together, it comes with significant risks. So, you kind of need to make a decision. Do you want to stick or do you want to twist? Do you want to go for what you know is in front of you? Do you want to take uh the bird in the hand if you like or do you fancy a go at the two in the bush? And uh certainly Harland Gaming 36 is two in the bush. Uh so yeah uh we'll see. We'll see what happens uh with all of that. I'm not really here to tell you which option you should be taking. I don't think and I think it you just kind of have to make a decision. Do I want to play it safe? Do I want to take a risk? I'd rather you guys have the information um available to you and know kind of a realistic outlay of what the options are um so you can make a realistic, you know, a comfortable decision for yourself. But for me, I just feel I would rather take the bird in the hand. Um I'm an Arsenal fan. I would love to support an Arsenal triple captain. I've not really been able to do that in recent years playing FPL. I really like the look of this one. And I think with Gabrielle there are there is some real potential to get a mega score here. I don't know how likely it is to happen but let's kind of figure it out. So I'm thinking Gabrielle triple captain. I'm like 80% triple captain Gabrielle for this gameweek for the kind of reasons we've already outlaid. What am I expecting from here? Well realistically let's go through. So clean sheet odds. We've got a projected clean sheets of 0.89. So let's say one clean sheet and maybe the other game Arsenal concede one goal. I think that's a pretty arsenal thing to do. So immediately you've got four points for playing. You've got one clean sheet. That's takes us to eight points. Then we look at Defcon next. And how likely is that to happen? Well, let's go back to Tom Hadley's uh graphic here that he posted a couple of weeks ago about the teams that give away Defcon points the most. Brenford give away defcon points to center backs 50% of the time. And we see Wolves give away Defcon points to center backs around 30% of the time. and Gabrielle in general gets Defcon points in around one in three games as well. So I think it is I think it is reasonable to expect uh defensive contribution points in one of the two games. So one clean sheet, one hit of the defcon, that takes us to 10 points without really doing very much. You add bonus points to that, maybe one bonus point, 11 points. That's a pretty basic scenario. uh a very realistic, you know, low expectations kind of scenario where he gets 11 points for a triple captain, 33 points. I think I'd be okay with it. I think I would be okay with that. But it could be so much more because what if we get extra bonus points? What if we get Defcon in both games? What if we get clean sheets in both games? What if we get, heaven forbid, a goal in one of the games? It is so so possible for Gabrielle. He's due a bullet header, right guys? And he has been kind of popping them in, you know, pretty regularly. If we go through his kind of expected numbers throughout the season, we expect an attacking return once every I don't know like five or six games, which what gives us I don't know over a double game week maybe a I don't know like maybe like a 60% chance maybe. Is that too much? No, like a 30% chance maybe of an attacking return. I don't know. It gives us like a 30% chance of an attacking return. 30 to 40% chance which I think isn't too bad. So I think 10 11 points as a base and then maybe a 30% chance let's be conservative of an attacking return on top of that which would push up the bonus points as well. I don't know guys there is a lot of potential here and you know if everything goes exactly to plan there is no reason why Gabrielle can't come away from this gameweek with like a 20 plus pointer this week. It's so possible. you know, if he gets the the clean sheet defcon um and goal combo, that's 17 points if he just does that in one of the two games. If he can do anything in the second game as well, we're looking at 20 points plus. And and that is just a monster monster score that is going to be hard to match even for Harland later on in the season. It's not going to be an easy feat to match. So, yeah, that's where I'm at right now, guys. I I think triple captain Gabrielle 26 is potentially the one because, you know, we know the scenario right now. We know the potential and uh it just seems like the sensible thing to do. Maybe too sensible for some people, but I'm not got a problem with it. So, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Triple captain, vice captain, by the way, is on Declan Rice. Um, in case anyone cares, but I mean, I'm not I'm not expecting or I'm I'm really hoping that that is not needed uh this week. Let's put it that way. Let's check out some of my transfer moves. Uh moving forward, we're are we are on of course on the uh fantasy football hub my team tool. If you want to check this out, use the link in the description and you can get a nice free trial to get full access to all of the hub tools. So yeah, we've spoken about gameweek 26 already. I'm still got pretty much the same plan of moving uh like I said Obi to Thiago and then in gameweek 28 maybe. Uh it will be one or the other. I don't know who I'll do first, but probably this way round and it'll be vert in for gaming 28 in this example. Um, which I know it keeps telling me that I'll be minus four in the bank, but it's just not true. I I can definitely afford this. In fact, I have.1 million to spare uh when making these transfers as well. So, that is what my my team will look like kind of gameweek 28. From there, I'll probably be looking to downgrade Enzo. I mean, I'll definitely play verse over Enzo, by the way. Um, but uh I'll be looking to, you know, take away Enzo out of the team uh at some point after that. Might not be in game at 28. Um, maybe game it 29. Maybe do something like Enzo to Wilson because I think Wilson's good fixtures start from there. West Ham uh through to Burnley in 31. So something like that. And then we can throw Wilson on the team. Maybe we don't have to play Anderson against Man City in that scenario. And then uh etc etc. Gameweek 30 will start to look better. We mentioned gameweek 31 maybe doing something like uh Richards to um Anderson as well. But again, we're going to have spare transfers in case anything goes wrong. This is kind arguably a bit of a luxury move and it would kind of leave our team looking something. We play Collins, assuming Collins is still playing, by the way, guys, because that could be an issue I need to deal with. But assuming Collins is playing, it leaves us with something a little bit like this. So, uh we'll have a full 11. um a full 11 for gaming 31 and a player on the bench and you know transfers to spare on top of that as well. And yes, I can afford it even though the screen is telling you I can't I definitely can. I've checked this out already. So yeah, something like that for gameweek 31 think could be pretty nice indeed. Um I'm I'm well planned, well prepared I think for gameweek 31 without having to use a free hit ship or anything like that. But anyway guys, that's going to be it for today. Please do drop a like. Please do subscribe as well. And let me know your thoughts on the triple captain situation this week as well. If you have any other questions surrounding it, I'll be more than happy to try and help you guys out with regards to chips and and strategy and doubles and blanks and all that stuff, guys, cuz I usually think I I I know what I'm talking about when it comes to this kind of thing. It's like maybe one of my specialties, but who knows, guys. Thanks for watching. Check out Keeper Void if you haven't done already, and I will see you tomorrow for 100 experts. See you later, mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "Gameweek 26 is here already and guys, it is the first double game rig of the season. So, I'm sure a few of you guys will be looking to make some transfers. Well, let's see who we should buy in this week's buyer void. This video is split into two parts. The first of which we'll be looking at those players you may already have in your team and which ones you should keep and which ones you should sell. Then, we'll be looking at players you might not have and which players you should buy and which players you should avoid. plays will be tier listed with the best plays at the top and the worst ones at the bottom. Welcome to FBM. My name is Dan. Yes, guys. A Tuesday deadline means an early buy, sell, keep, avoid episode today, guys. Unfortunately, we are recording this video before the Sunday games, but we've had eight out of 10 gameweek 25 games done now. So, I think we can make some pretty good assumptions. And to be honest, we're mostly looking at Arsenal anyway, aren't we, right now? But let's go through things anyway. So, we got to start off with those forwards you might already have in your team. And I think Harland, even though he hasn't played yet, assuming he is even starting on Sunday, some of you guys will know more than me right now about Harland, but I think over the long term, we are going to see him start regularly. The next game after the Liverpool game is going to be against Fulham at home, and I think that is a decent fixture. Have Newcastle at home, Newcastle team that still conceding plenty of goals there as well, followed by Leads and an out of form Nottingham Forest at home. So, there are still some really good fixtures for Harland coming up. So assuming he is starting and I don't see why he wouldn't be when we come to these fixtures, I think there is still going to be plenty of opportunities and I think by removing Harland from your team, you are taking such an enormous risk that's probably just not worthwhile. So provided you don't need the money and for most people they're not going to need the money. Harland is just going to be a keep. His underlying data is still very strong. He's still the penalty taker at Manchester City and the fixtures are good enough for him as well. So no strong reason to sell in my opinion. Ektika is also going to be a keep here. I I think the Sunderland away game is maybe a little bit tricky. Um but I think Forest is maybe turning into a slightly easier fixture on recent form and after that we got likes of West Ham and Wolves there as well. So I like the look of Eatique really for this run of fixtures. He's clearly in redhot form at the moment. No pun intended and I think he is going to continue to deliver. He's got some of the best underlying numbers in the entire league per I guess 90 minutes. But the problem has been whether he's going to be playing or not. Recently, we've seen him play three games. One of them was a sub appearance. 1.83 xG and 0.61 xa during that time is really good numbers for the limited minutes he's had play. So, as long as he keeps playing, which I think he should do now, he is getting back to his full fitness. Each is still long-term absent. I think Ekit is going to be great. Thiago is the other player I would definitely be looking to keep. Now, um if you've sold him recently, maybe you missed out on his five-pointer in game meet 25. not the worst thing in the world, but if you did keep him, you got that. And even though you're probably going to be looking to bench him against Arsenal. Hopefully, you can cover him for this week. I don't think it would be the end of the world if you had to play him against uh Arsenal in 26, but ideally you would bench him. But I think the thing is here, his fixtures from gameweek 27 or more particularly from gameweek 28 are just so good. And I think a lot of people will be looking to buy Thiago after this gameweek. So if you already have him, you can essentially save yourself a transfer just by holding on to him one week against Arsenal. Hopefully bench him and after that I think the points will definitely come and I think next week's by seller void video. We're going to be looking to put Thiago in the buy section very very heavily. In fact, maybe even the top of the buy section for forwards into our monitors. I think Watkins even though he is a bit expensive, his numbers are okay. He's back and available of course as we know and the fixtures are pretty decent over the next four. But even that Chelsea at home game, I don't mind for Watkins too much. Chelsea still conceding plenty of chances we as we see week on week. Um not sure if Watkins is going to be the penalty taker or not. I think there's a lot of people speculating around who will be the next penalty taker for Aston Villa. So yeah, no promises there, but certainly you know his numbers are okay. The fixtures are good. His price is a little high, which is why he's not necessarily a keep, but a very high monitor. After that, we have got the Bournemouth boys. Creepy Junior unlucky not to score in gameweek 25. Um his ball striking is just absolutely incredible. And in terms of value for money, he is definitely a pick that is uh definitely proving some value there. So if you are, you know, you are Krooppy owner, you're not really looking at any other forwards right now. I think he's absolutely fine to keep. And to be fair, he's fine to play in each of the next four game weeks as So if you you're a Thiago and Krooppy Junior owner for example, you can bench Thiago in a game like 26 and you can play Krooppy instead. Evan Nilson's a really tough one. I think he was another player really unlucky in gameweek 25. Martinez had a really good game um for Aston Villa against Bournemouth in 25 and Evan Nilson had some real opportunities not just to score but also to assist. His underlying numbers are still very strong as you can see and the fixtures are decent. Um, however, obviously there has been a couple of blanks here and Evan Nlson being such a differential player may be a risky player to hold, but generally speaking, unless you have, you know, another forward who you're really keen on, all of these players in the monitor section, I would probably just look to keep Calbertt Lewen. Obviously, the fixtures in the next three are not ideal. Even Sunderland at 29, you may have a a different reading on that fixture and actually think that's a tough fixture as well, but his numbers are okay. He's cheap. is on penalties. There are some stills some things to like about Calbertt Lewin. I think the problem is a lot of these forwards um that we have in our teams right now are kind of average. So, you know, you have to kind of look at it. Is there another forward who you're really keen to get? If so, maybe some of these players could be sacrificed. But again, I wouldn't be rushing Calvin Leuen out the door unless you kind of needed to, unless you really really felt strongly about it. And in the cell category, I'm going to put Bowen here. Um the fixtures coming up are tougher. Um, Man United have been a strong defense recently as have uh Liverpool. Even Bournemouth are improving defensively as well. But here's the problem with Bowen. He has scored two goals in the last six game weeks, which looks great on paper, but one of them was a penalty and the other one was a cross that somehow found the back of the net. Um, so I would say that maybe Bowen has been a little fortunate in his returns. Of course, you were going to keep him against Burnley for the upside in that game, but now that that Burnley fixture is out the way, I think I would be much more comfortable selling Bowen because really his underlying numbers compared to a lot of the other forwards are pretty low. He's kind of the lowest on this list out of him and all of the players above him, as you can see on this list, just 1.5 xG. Considering he's played six games, one of those, well, most of that XG was the penalty that he took. It's kind of very difficult to kind of justify keeping him at 7.7 million. Well, Tomato with his continued rotation risk is going to continue to be a cell and Mateta some kind of long-term injury that he's got right now may require surgery. We'll find that out in the next couple of days. But it looks like he is going to be a player who is in the best case scenario like plays some games but is managed his minutes managed. Of course, Crystal Palace have signed a new striker who we will talk about today. So, I think Mateta is going to be a pretty straightforward sell because uh yeah, it looks like he is could be out really for the long term here into the midfield. Um, Declan Rice, did he blank in gameweek 25? It's up to you what you think a blank is. He did get defensive contributions and the clean sheet. So, a five-pointer for Rice. I don't know. It's kind of this the equivalent of a player getting an assist and no bonus point and no clean sheet, isn't it? So, it's not the end of the world. Uh, wasn't the worst score in the world. And I think we have seen recently that that Rice's creative numbers are really strong. 16 key passes, 1.67 expected assists. This is some of the highest numbers you'll see um from uh from a creative point of view um over the last few game weeks, over the last six really. So, I think Rice is still a really good pick. I definitely would not be looking to sell him or swap him for a different Arsenal player ahead of the double game week. So, he's going to be a really really straightforward keep for me even though some people are selling because they are a little bit uh maybe concerned about some of the blanks recently. But the data is there, the defcons are there, the double game week's there. No reason to sell. Um, but although I would maybe say gameweek 27, we could maybe reconsider that a little bit because maybe Rice has been playing a little bit deeper than usual recently, but that's just going to get you more Defcon. So, it's not, you know, there just different ways of looking at it. Still on those set pieces, so still going to have opportunities in that way. Rogers definitely going to be a keep. I know a lot of people have been worried about Rogers recently in gameweek 25 or ahead of gameweek 25. So many people were selling him. He was a Rogers was a keep last week. He's going to be a keep again this week. I think people maybe lost a bit of patience on Rogers and some people punished last game week and if you're still thinking about selling Rogers I think you could be punished even more because Aston Villa their fixtures are reasonably strong now in the next four gamew weeks really all the way up until gameweek 31 where they face West Ham in 31 where some people may even be thinking about captaining Rogers when kind of we see Arsenal and Man City with the blank gameweek in 31. Rogers could be your your captain actually. So, yeah, really a a hold all the way until gameweek 31. If you're a wild carding in 32, he's going to take you all the way up there um with plenty of returns, I'm sure, in this period. Enzo with a blank in gameweek 25, a disappointing one at that because he did perform really well in that game, at least from a u an analytical point of view, had some good opportunities to score. One in particular, created a huge chance for Netto towards the end of the game, which Netto completely whiffed. Um so, that was a bit of a shame. It's just a case of, you know, Enzo blanking for one week and I think maybe people lose patience, but the numbers are still good. Very good. In fact, you can kind of see this 2.65 xG, 1.29 XA. Really, really strong numbers here. Four big chances. Of course, there has been a penalty in there as well. And the next two fixtures, Leadeds and Burnley at home. Everything is looking pretty positive for Enzo. So, not a player I would really be looking to sell, although I wouldn't necessarily buy him either because if you are buying him, he is a pretty short-term pick. We have also seen from Cole Palmer that Cole Palmer is still not fully fit and he is still, you know, having to have his minutes managed somewhat, which means there will always be, you know, a period of the game where Enzo is the penalty taker because when Palmer isn't on the pitch, Enzo is the penalty taker and there are going to be moments when Palmer is off the pitch. So, there we go. We'll move on to Wilson in Monitor. The next two fixtures are pretty rough for him, but he's another player similar to Rogers where he's a really nice player to take all the way up to a gameweek 32 wild card. So, if you are planning on the wild card in gameweek 32, then he's definitely going to be a keep for you because we've got Burnley in gameweek 31. So, Wilson is going to be actually one of the best picks in gameweek 31 in a week where there's a lot going to be a lot of players missing. So, that's really nice. the next two game weeks. I'm hoping that owners can maybe bench him against Man City away, Sunderland away, may maybe Spurs at home. Not sure on that fixture. You never really know what you're going to get with Spurs, but I think Wilson is definitely playable at the very least against uh Spurs and arguably against Sunderland as well, but that has been a tricky away fixture for teams in the Premier League this season. Uh plenty of shots from Wilson. XG numbers pretty good. A little bit of an overperformance there in terms of goals, but an underperformance in terms of his creativity. no assists from 1.11 expected assists there. So that is uh maybe somewhere he can improve. But overall, as long as you can bench Wilson, I would keep him. If you can't, you know, that maybe does drop him down a little bit. So is an interesting one. I think we are going to see some rotation at some point, but I don't really know when it's going to be. The next few fixtures are good as we know for Man City. They do have some strong fixtures, but those with one eye on gameweek 31 will be thinking, you know, Semeno blank gameweek 31. Do I really want to keep him in the long term? Maybe not. If you're looking for a new midfielder, and I think to be fair, the the standard of midfielder, the kind of your expectations of what you should get from a midfielder should be very high right now because there are so many great midfield options. So, I think that does drop Semeno down into monitor. But a very low priority sell like I would only sell him again if if there's someone you really really like the look of. Kuna, I think, is where we start to get creep in a few more concerns. So has the concern of the blank gameweek coming up but aside from that looks good. Kuna the fixtures are good. He is getting FPL points but he is vastly overperforming here. Three goals and one assist from what's that 0.9 expected goal involvements or returns from 0.9 expected goal involvements. That is a big overperformance. Obviously, he scored a few worldy wonder goals recently, but one concern is he is getting substituted off a little bit early in games and he seems to be the first sub in every single game getting subbed off for Shesho and given that it seems to be working this kind of strategy from Michael Carrick and Manchester United. I do think that's going to continue. So, what is your expectation here? Are you expecting Kuna to continue to score like wonder goals in the kind of 60 70 minutes that he plays each game week? Maybe, maybe you are. Maybe that can happen and maybe he can improve his numbers too. That can happen too. The fixtures are certainly good enough for to to allow that to happen. But if we have very high standards of what we're expecting from midfielders right now, does Kuna quite cut the mustard? I don't know. That's going to be up to you. He is definitely a player we need to be keeping an eye on throughout this uh period whilst his minutes are reduced and while he's not getting those high xG chances and kind of high volume of chances either. And Jai is a really really uh disappointing one really. I had much higher hopes from him. Um I think we are maybe edging towards Anjai being a cell. Everton in attack maybe not completely clicking right now. Um obviously you know they scored a couple of goals against Fulham. Um but for a lot of that game they they they didn't look too good to be honest. Uh certainly in the first periods of the game they did not look great. And Jay is not really getting the opportunities that we'd hoped from him. He's had three game weeks now back since AFCON and he's barely mustered up any shots. three shots, two key passes. I'm just not sure this is good enough when we are we do have such a high standard of midfielder. So in that case, I feel enjoy is wandering towards the cell section at this point. And then we've got some players which who just are cells. So Foden is going to be a cell. Continued rotation risk and very expensive. Gordon, I think it's going to be very difficult to get any kind of real information about his injury status because Eddie How is a liar in his press conferences. And Bayio Saka looks like he is going to be out for at least the first game of the double game week and probably the second as well. And given that we do need to make sure we do have our three Arsenal players in place for the double game week. Saka is just going to be a cell. Let's check out some defenders guys. Chaloba first of all if you have him I think you got to keep him. Two game weeks really really nice couple of weeks for him here. I wouldn't necessarily buy Chalaba but for the next two you keep him. He has been one of the best defensive contribution defenders over this six gameweek period and I think that's probably going to continue into the next fixtures as well. So even if Chelsea do lose their clean sheets and they will lose the occasional clean sheet. We know that Chelsea are still conceding so many chances um you're still going to have defcon to back you up and you know leads at home burning at home even if you are a you know one of the weaker defenses in the league you're still going to have a chance in some of the more favorable fixtures whilst playing at home. So for the next two weeks, Chaloba, I think he is going to be an absolutely great keep from 28 onwards though, probably going to be a great sell. So Mark Gay is going to be the next player here. If you bought him at a cheap price, I would just continue to own him through this period of games. You are probably going to have to sell him by gameweek 31 because of that blank gameweek. But for the time being, I think he is going to be absolutely fine. Um, actually has had some opportunities to score uh well goals and assists recently, but hasn't quite come off. Defcon's a complete myth with him though. Not looking likely at all. Mukle, a player I would look to keep, would bench him for gameweek 26, but particularly again if you got him at a low price, I'll be looking to keep him and probably play him in that Fulham game. Maybe that leads game in 29 as well. Definitely going to be a really nice rotation option over the next period of games. Even if uh Liverpool in 26 isn't ideal. So no patience lost on Mukle quite yet. Collins is one to monitor. Now, if Collins had played in gameweek 25, if he had started, I would definitely put him in the keep section, but he's actually dropped into monitor. Now, you know, Arsenal next, I think you're probably going to, if he's playing, you're probably going to just bench him for this game week and then play him for some great fixtures that are coming up very soon for Brenford. But there is just this this uh kind of concern around is he like a first choice player for Brenford anymore. I think the answer is probably yes. He missed out gameweek 24 with a knock. Gameweek 25, I think, because the the center back pairing of Aya and Vandenberg did so well in gameweek 25 uh in 24, it was kind of kept on in gameweek 25. So, same two center backs. But with two goals conceded against Newcastle, I wonder if maybe we could see probably Vandenberg drop out and Collins come back in. Now, I think the good thing about Collins is the fact that you are going to probably bench him in 26 anyway. hopefully plan to bench him in 26 regardless. And if so, you're going to get one more week of information about whether he is going to continue to be or whether he's going to be the starting center back. I think he probably should be. There's been high praise around Collins from Andrews and I do think that he is probably first to us and he's, you know, he's the captain of the team as well. So, it's a really really interesting one. Um, difficult to get a read on it to be honest, guys. He's still an amazing defcon defender. when he plays, I think there's going to be great opportunities for clean sheets. If I knew he was nailed, I would love to have him for for the run after the Arsenal game. So, one to keep an eye on throughout the week, guys. Hopefully, we can get a better read on that very soon. Malik Chow. Um, yeah, maybe you are starting to think about selling Chiao right now. Um, even though I don't mind the Spurs fixture and I don't mind the Everton fixture in 28 either. It's 27 Man City, 29, Man United. Don't particularly love them. And it's just Newcastle just not keeping clean sheets right now. They're conceding way too many goals. 12 goals conceded in six game weeks. This is not good enough. Even though I mean look at these underlying numbers, man. 6.6 non-penalty expected goals against for Newcastle in this six gameweek period. And yet they've conceded 12. So unless they can start to regress to their mean or progress to their mean, I guess in terms of that that are those expected numbers versus the actual numbers, I'm worried about Newcastle defenders generally. And I'm worried that there's the fixes aren't good enough to justify keeping them. Maybe one to monitor. I think there are higher priority sales. Tarovski, for example, Everton are just not looking good defensively right now. The defensive contributions for Tarovski are seemingly, you know, lowering. They're going to getting gradually lower. And the next three fixtures, I don't really know if there's going to be any clean sheets in this run of fixtures. Particularly that Everson are just conceding so many chances. And maybe we don't even have Defcon to kind of back us up with Tarovski. I would be maybe more um more I don't know generous with Tarovski if he wasn't 5.8 million, but he is so expensive and I don't know if he's justifying it right now. Vanerven is going to be another monitor. Just pretty average fixtures generally here for Vanerven. So, uh yeah, maybe who could replace him, but at least he's a body. Rhys James probably going to be a cell given his he's his has an injury issue right now and the next fixture against Leeds is in just a couple of days time. Not sure if he's going to recover in time for that. Although I do think he will probably play against Burnley in 27 if he is uh back and available. But again, because the fixes after Burnley are so poor for Chelsea, you may as well sell him now, particularly at 5.7 million. Du continues to be a sell. Um, he is still out for what, probably 8 and 1/2 game weeks now. Or sorry, 8 and a half weeks. He's going to be out now since it was like 10 game weeks when he was originally injured. Or sorry, 10 weeks when he was originally injured. It's been a week and a half since his injury. Yeah, he's out for another eight and a half weeks. There you go. Romero three game, no, four game suspension, isn't it? Four game suspension for his second red card of the season. Terrible stuff, but yeah, definitely going to be a cell there if you do have him in your squad. By the way, guys, don't forget to like the video uh today and do subscribe if you want to follow along with these transfer tips every single game week. We've got some tight deadlines, but plenty of videos to come this week. Okay, let's go to forwards to buy. And again, I'm going to say a similar thing to uh kind of what I said last game week. I not really looking at many forward transfers right now, but some people will be in a situation where they kind of have to buy a forward or are desperate to buy a new forward. If so, Ekit I think looks good for the kind of medium term. So I think he is a player you can pick up now and just be confident with going forward all the way up until you know the gameweek 32 wild card or potentially even beyond that as well if even if you're not wild carding in gameweek 32. So he looks really strong at the moment. Great form, great underlying numbers. Fixtures I think are good enough particularly after gameweek 26. So a nice long-term option there. Jah Pedro not really so much of a long-term option. Next two gameweeks look great for him like genuinely really really good but after that Chelsea do have horrible fixtures. So, if you are looking for something ultra short-term, then maybe Joel Pedro is your guy. Maybe some rotation risk there. And it should be said, I know a lot of people look at his gameweek 25 score and think, \"Wow, he must have had an amazing game.\" He absolutely didn't. Um, he took like one shot, made no key passes whatsoever, super low xG, super low XA, came away with two assists because he won two penalties. Um, so he got a lot of points for doing very little. And as you can see on screen, guys, the underlying numbers aren't really there. To take seven shots in six game weeks is not ideal, particularly with two key passes. Seven shots. These are really low numbers, but the fixes are good. We have seen him be fairly clinical in recent uh gameweeks, which you might consider to be good form. Mane is the other player I'm going to put in the buy category here just because he has a double gameweek basically. But remember guys, if you buy Mane or indeed any Wolves player this week, you are probably well probably gonna have to transfer them out in gaming 31 when they do have a blank. So ultimately, if you're buying a Wolves player, you are spending two transfers on a Wolves player. One to bring them in this week and another to take them out next week. So you kind of have to factor that in if you are going for them. That said, Mar still looking good, taking set pieces, corners, free kicks, which is nice. Did hit the woodwork as well in game weeks 25. So maybe a little unfortunate not to get returns. And look, the numbers are good here in terms of the shot volume. These are good. You know, key passes, these are not bad, though. I don't mind Mané at all for that value for money. Um, let's see what he can do in game 26. Now, the Forest are looking a little worse as we saw against Leads where they had a really poor performance. I'm kind of a bit feeling a bit more bullish about Mané because we know a two-pointer is probably what's going to happen against Arsenal in the second of the double game. Right, Jockarez? Where do we rate him? um he's going to be a high monitor and I think really that the risk you take with Joarez is missing out on the other Arsenal guys. You're going to probably want to have double defense as a minimum from Arsenal across this double game. You're going to be picking one more guy. Is it going to be Declan Rice? Is it going to be a third Arsenal defender/goalkeeper? Is it going to be someone else or is it going to be Yarez? If you want to take a risk with Yarez, fair enough. There is some rotation risk there as we have seen benched again in game week 25. He did come off the bench and score a couple of goals and his form is improving with Saka out. We expect him to be the penalty taker as well. So there gen genuinely is some things to like about Yarez at the moment but it is risky. He's only taken again just like Joel Petro seven shots two key passes during this period. He's 8.7 million. At that kind of price you're probably going to be bringing him in in 26 and then selling him again in 27 because the value for money is not quite there. I do wonder if there maybe is some kind of play where you bring in Yokarez for one week and then move him to Echit next week or something like that could potentially work, but ultimately there are some risk factors with Jockz. If you're happy to take that on, I don't think it's the worst move in the world. I really really don't. And that's maybe I maybe wouldn't have said that a couple of weeks ago, but now I'm kind of open to the idea of a risky Jockarez differential. I think outside of, you know, your main guys, the defenders, your your Rya, your Declan Rice, outside of those guys, I think Yarez is my next favorite Arsenal pick. Certainly more so than any other of the non Rice midfielders. Um, to be honest, so yeah, put him high monitor, but the risk is sacrificing your other, you know, one of your other Arsenal players, I guess. Creeper Jr. could buy potentially if you would want to, if you're looking for something cheap, fixtures are reasonably good. Um, Strand Larsson is interesting as a differential if you fancy him to start some games. I think the fixtures are certainly good enough for Crystal Palace, particularly in the next two where he could get some returns here. We can't really speak much about his data. I'm interested to see how he plays uh today as I record this video to see if there is any promise there if he is even starting that is. Um, so it's going to be a really interesting one. Strand Larson and one to monitor at the very least. If you are going to go for him though, it probably needs to be this gameweek because Burnley at home, that's the money fixture. Havitz not as keen on this one compared to someone like Yokarez. I think Havz is still has some rotation risk particularly as he's just come back from injury. I think the first game in the double game week, I wouldn't be surprised to see Havz benched. Even though, you know, he's played pretty well in his time since returning from injury, not just in the Premier League, but in other competitions as well. But I think the risk there is just too high for me particularly as he might not even be playing as a striker. If Joz is in good form playing as the striker, is he going to be playing in midfield or is it going to be someone else? Erdigard or um or potentially I'm not exactly sure because obviously Erdigard has some injury issues too. So too much mystery, too much confusion, and the fact that he's a forward who probably won't play as a forward puts me off a little bit as well. Avoid Calbertt Lewen. Fixtures just are not good enough to buy him right now. Same with Bowen. And as always guys, we are going to put all Brenford players in the avoid section this week. That includes Dango. I know you guys will be looking at Dango this week. Um, I will definitely be talking about Brenford guys from gameweek 27 as potential buys, but you just don't buy players against Arsenal. It's like the cardinal sin of FPL. If a players are about to play Arsenal, you don't buy them. Doesn't mean you sell them, but you definitely don't buy them. Onto our midfielders. And guys, I'm actually genuinely going to put Bruno Fernandez ahead of Rice in the double gameweek. Even though yes, we have um technically we do have Rice with a double gameweek and Bruno uh with the non-double game week. I guess still, man, I it's just it's just Bruno is just so on it right now. He looks so good right now. He looks like such a good pick right now that he's so difficult to justify going without him. So much so that I think that Bruno in a single game week probably outscores Rice on a double gameweek. Maybe that's controversial, maybe it's not, but that's kind of how I feel about Bruno right now. Um maybe could have got even more in gameweek 25 to be honest. I mean, Shesho missed an enormous chance in the last second of the game, which would have been a Bruno assist. Um yeah, it's just looking too good with Bruno right now. And he's such a good captain every week as well. probably not in gameweek 26 because of the double game week and we will talk about um double gameweek captains and indeed triple captains in this week's video. So make sure you stay tuned for that one. Um but ultimately yeah Bruno is just essential right now. Can't say any more than that. Declan Rice is um also going to be a very obvious buy this week. You know if you're looking for a new midfielder you need a third Arsenal player. Rice is just so obvious. Good for Defcon. Still still on all those set pieces which is always going to be, you know, several routes to points as always. Taking long shots as well. Took a good long shot in game at 25. Could have been a goal. Wasn't on this occasion. And Florian Vertz is another player I like the look of. I'm not fully convinced by this Sunderland away fixture, but in general over the next kind of period of games, I really do like the idea of Berts. I did put him pretty low on the on last week's episode of of buy keeper void. I do kind of regret that. I am recording this video before the Man City game, but I do think that maybe Vertz could do well in that Man City game. I guess again, you guys might know by the time you've watched this how well Vertz does in that game. But regardless, as long as he doesn't get injured, he has got to be a player that we are keeping an eye on. And I I I probably did underrate him last game. Yeah, I guess that's just because our standard of midfielder is just so high right now. So yeah, definitely on the cards and I think the fact that Forest is looking like a slightly better fixture as well now I think has definitely improved the these uh Liverpool players in terms of our rankings. Palmer. Wow. Okay, we need to talk about him. 20 points in game mix 25. People will be clamoring over him understandably so. But let's just kind of maybe calm down a little bit because although he is a good buy because his ceiling is very high, there are some very obvious downsides to him as well. First of all, game week 25 where he did get his big return, it was two penalties. Like like any penalty taking player who has two penalties awarded to them in one game is going to look good in that one game. I mean people thinking about selling Eagle Thiago if he happen to get two penalties in one game, no one would be talking about it, would they? So it does maybe warp our perception a little bit on players. Now penalty takers are amazing to own. Of course they are. But, you know, I think it maybe looks like the gameweek 20 the gameweek uh score of 20 points was was obviously amazing, but it looks maybe a bit better than the performance was because it was two penalties if that makes sense. So, realistically, still very good, but maybe not as good as it looks, if that makes sense. We've also seen that Palmer is not fully fit. He's kind of come out in an interview and said, \"Yeah, I'm I'm just not fully fit right now essentially.\" And beyond gameweek 27, the fixtures are really rough for Chelsea. So, if you're looking for a high upside short-term differential, I guess, then yeah, Palmer could be your guy, but it is not without its risks and he is almost certainly a transfer back out from gameweek 28 onwards. Rogers is also going to be in this conversation. You could arguably put Rogers ahead of Palmer because Rogers is such a nice kind of medium-term hold all the way up until gameweek 31. Definitely would still be considering him, although his underlying data is maybe maybe leaves a little bit to be desired. At least he's taking plenty of shots. Sar is an really interesting pick. I'm curious to watch him today to see how he does. But Burnley and Wolves in the next two fixtures. If he's continuing to be the penalty taker, then we've got to like the look of this, haven't we? Getting plenty of chances to score big chances as well during his limited time since returning from AFCON. I think if you're looking for a cheap midfielder, he's probably where I'd be looking to go at this exact moment. Semeno is also going to be a monitor. There are is obviously some advantages of these nice fixtures coming up, but could there be rotation risk? Are you kind of walking yourself into a transfer out in gameweek 31? Yes, you probably are. But you could say the same thing about Ismile, who's also going to be blanking in gameweek 31 as well. I regret to inform you that Bruno G is going to be in the avoid section. I just it's so difficult to justify him as an FBL pick, although he is the penalty taker now apparently, especially in Gordon's absence. So, there's that. Um, but really outside of that, I think the fixtures are not really quite good enough. They're kind of average at best. I think Man City away and Manchester United at home are difficult fixtures and Spurs and Everton, I don't know, maybe somewhere in the middle probably slightly good fixtures, but maybe not amazing. So overall, um, yeah, when there are so many other midfielders performing right now who look genuinely good, whether that's just through penalties or, you know, from their overall play, I just don't really see how Bruno fits in when, you know, our standard is so high. The fixtures are not amazing here. the their the underlying data I don't think is is is incredible necessarily. And are you relying on penalties with him a little bit? I don't know. It's really difficult, guys. I'm going to have to put him in a void just cuz just by by virtue of there being better picks out there right now. But uh if you disagree, fair enough. Somerville, I think the fixtures are not again not good enough for West Ham going into these upcoming game weeks. So even though Somerville has been doing amazingly in such good form right now, just don't think this is the moment to buy him with Manchester United and Liverpool in the next three, Dardo would also look to avoid may have picked up an injury in gameweek 26 which um could limit his minutes uh sorry picked up an injury in gameweek 25 which could limit his minutes in gameweek 26. I think he's was already such a high-risk player, high-risisk pick. Don't think I'd go there. And defenders, pretty much Arsenal defenders. any of these guys, Gabrielle and Timber are your priority ones. But if you want to go for Celiba, I think that is also okay if you're maybe looking to go for a triple up or you can't quite afford uh some of the other guys. Um but Gabrielle, you know, I probably take a minus four to get Gabrielle in the team to be honest. Like he is so so crucial for this game week to be totally honest with you guys. Outside of that, Califuri, Hin Capier, other guys I think maybe a little too risky for me. So, it's really just these three Arsenal defenders I would be looking at. So, not so much Calif Fury to be honest. You're going to have to be a real risk taker to go there and just not comfortable recommending that in a video like today. James Hill, the new cheat code of FPL. Great fixtures coming up 3.9 million and has actually been one of the best defconers of recent gameweeks as well. 70 defensive contribution points. only one player and that's a strike at uh or stra at Leads uh is the only player to get more defcons than Hill in the last six game weeks which is crazy crazy stuff. So second best in that regard um and the fixtures are good and he's cheap. Yeah, I think Bournemouth are improving defensively as well. Their numbers are trending um towards a in a positive direction. I think this is a good pick even better than Sessi potentially. I don't know if you are factoring in value for money, I think Hill is a better pick than Senessi, but both good because the fixtures are just good for Bournemouth, particularly from a defensive point of view. Um, I think Crystal Palace fixtures are are good from a defensive point of view as well, particularly in the next two. And I would be hoping for some clean sheets here, despite Crystal Palace's poor uh recent form. Rich is the defcon guy, but if you're willing to spend a little bit more money, 5.8 million mono is going to be uh definitely an interesting option to go for as well. But I think Riches at 4.4 4 million because he is so uh cheap because he is safe getting regular defensive contributions. He's maybe the more sensible of the two picks. Dalow is also going to be in the monitor section. You could go for him potentially. The fixes are pretty decent here for him. Um but defensive contributions just don't really happen for him. Pretty rare. Um maybe do have some attacking threat there. Um but yeah, he's kind of an interesting one. Not really my kind of defender, but I I kind of I I see the vision in him. I see the vision. Would definitely look to avoid Kuka. know defcon 6 million so really expensive and really I don't even know if leads at home is a great fixture for a defender leads score goals man they really really do um Burnley after that is is you know very good for Kuka but after that fixture is terrible so I think if you're looking to buy Chelsea defenders you've probably left it a little bit too late at this point you should have done it before and actually from here on there are players that are you know just as good over the next two game weeks and beyond that much much better Mark Gayhee if you haven't already got him don't think I'd be looking to buy him now necessarily and Mukle not the greatest week to buy him ahead of that Liverpool fixture. And let's wrap up with some goalkeepers guys. Um yeah, obviously you're going to keep Rya ahead of the double game week in 26. Got a bonus point in gameweek 25 which was really nice. Couple of saves there for him as well. Um if you got Sanchez would also be looking to keep him for the next two game weeks and then we can kind of reassess at that point. If you're looking to sell a goalkeeper, maybe Pigford is the only goalkeeper I maybe be looking to sell just because Everton just seem to be, you know, getting worse defensively, which is a little worrying there. Um, but, you know, even that, I mean, I'm never convinced by any goalkeeper transfers to be honest, unless it's a player like Cells who is kind of injured right now or a player who is like not playing regularly. If you're looking to buy a new goalkeeper, Rya is a really obvious one. I still believe Rya is, you know, the best goalkeeper pick in the game. um which is kind of backed up by um all of the clean sheets and it's the double game week right now is just a good time to jump on if you haven't if you're looking for a new goalkeeper right now you haven't got your triple Arsenal sorted maybe the way to get your triple Arsenal it's just just go very simple go for David Rya um we got Jose Sa maybe as a potential alternative here as well again I'm not too super convinced by this one but I think you could definitely potentially go for Jose S because of the uh just the fact that um you know going to get a double game week. I think some of the fixtures are okay. I think he is playable in some fixtures. Maybe could work as as a rotation goalkeeper at 4.2 million. Maybe you could hide him on your bench in gameweek 31. Um because he's obviously a goalkeeper. If your other goalkeeper does have a fixture in gameweek 31, like even if it's Dravka, then you know maybe that could work that way as well. Um Wolves are improving defensively. I know they conceded, you know, a whole bunch of goals against Chelsea, but you know, penalties are going to make score lines look a lot worse. And then for avoid, don't think I would be buying Sanchez at this point and Pigford I definitely wouldn't be buying at this point in the season. But that's pretty much all the players we've got today. We covered so much. But as always guys, there's always more players that we miss because we can't talk about every player in the Premier League. So if there's any player I didn't mention in today's video, let me know in the comments section and we'll give them a rating, a buy, sell, keep, or avoid. And I'll try and give some justification in some of the comments as well. So let me know in the replies guys. Drop a like guys. Do subscribe. We are got to be locking in because the new deadline is upon us so so soon. So plenty of videos to come this week guys. Looking forward to sharing them with you and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "Hello and welcome to another video and podcast from Fantasy Football Scout. My name is Joe and as ever I'm joined by Neil Fanty Football Scouts editor to discuss the latest team news and injury developments ahead of the deadline. It's gameweek 27 coming up u on Saturday uh morning afternoon I think it is and but it's Friday now. Neil, welcome. How are you? >> I'm not so bad. Yeah. Yeah. Recovering from the double game with 26 disappointment. >> Oh yes. >> Um otherwise otherwise pretty fine. >> Yeah. I I thought I was heading for my worst um gameweek of the season. Um but luckily it was only my second worst. So uh not every cloud. Um welcome to those joining us in the live chat. Tiger JMO FPL Bar um Dennis uh let's talk vinyl. Uh me Rodri J77 Lag Neil um FPL Rubber Ducky and many many more. Thanks so much for joining us early on in the live chat wherever you're uh joining us from. Uh let's get stuck in straight away. Aston Villa against Leads. What's the latest from Aston Villa? >> One of the last ones we had this afternoon was was Emmery. Uh he's confirmed pretty much what we thought that Mik Cash would be back for this one. That was always the target and he's training the last two days and feeling good. Uh and everyone else who was unavailable is still so so Kamara Tieleman's McInn and Allison all still out. Harvey Elliot has been added to our list as well. Marco Bezel uh whose name Emry loves to say he got sent off last weekend and will be suspended. We're not entirely sure how long that is for because uh it's not clear whether it was an obvious goal scoring opportunity which it was. >> Yeah. >> Or whether it was serious foul play which it also was. >> Okay. >> We'll try and get clarification on that. But he he will he wouldn't have played anyway. It would be Martin in goal. >> Yeah. >> But he's suspended for this one at the very least. Uh and everyone else more or less is available. >> Okay. Right. And what's the latest from leads? >> Yeah, very positive from Daniel Farer yesterday. Uh they've only got one absentee that is Noah Okafur. He came on for the hamstring injury last weekend and he'll be out between two to four weeks, but everyone else is available. That includes Anton Stack, who's back. Uh so is Pascal Shout and so is Daniel James. >> Okay. Right. Before we go on, just reminder, do press that like button. does help us out and do give us a fivestar review if you're enjoying the content wherever you're receiving this podcast if you're listening to it as well. Um, also do remember to subscribe to fantasyfootscout.co.uk uh to uh get access to our latest uh tools and gadgets in our members area there and obviously subscribe to where you're receiving um podcasts and also uh uh f our fantasy football scout channel on YouTube as well. Um everyone on the live chat uh is telling us where they're from, which is great. Um, people are joining us from Thailand. Very exciting. I had a great time when I visited there for a couple of months. And also they're joining us from Surrey, which I've also had good times in when I visited. Uh, and Wales as well, which is always wonderful as well. Thanks so much for joining us uh from wherever you're from. Uh, Brenford against Brighton. Um, okay. Yeah, this is the start of a really good run of fixtures for Brenford. So, lots of interest in there um uh assets especially because uh Brighton and my team are in an absolute woeful runner form at the moment. So, Brenford uh what is the latest there? >> Pretty positive from Brenford's point of view. Kevin Shard is back from a three match ban. Reese Nelson's available as well after he couldn't face Arsenal. Um Dilva, Carvalo, and Malambo, they're just the long-term ones. And aside from that, we think everyone's fit. Um Andrew said this afternoon that everyone's come through the Mlesfield game well and then the players that missed it which included ego Thiago and Jordan Henderson they will come back into the squad. So it just sounds like some manage minute management for Thiago which has been the case in the cup games this season. Both him and Henderson have been very carefully managed in the Carabal Cup and now the FA Cup. So it sounds like he's fine. >> Okay. So what is um what do we think is going to be in the predicted lineup up front as well particularly with Sharda coming back Lewis Potter in con form as well um and obviously Dango Utara will be of interest to people as well. So we think Chargo um will be starting up front obviously but who will be joining him? Yeah, that's the thing. I haven't haven't finalized me predict lineup yet, but currently it has has not got shard in because um Andrews has rewarded form. Okay. Lot this season. We've seen it with um when Dango came back from Africa Open Nations, he had to sit on the bench for a few game weeks >> because Damsgard and Yensen were in such good form. Dam's guard I think was playing on the right or left and then or Yansen on some weeks and we've seen it with Nathan Collins at center half who was urs wild ever present then got a knock in training like to his face sat on the bench and then Vandenberg came in who himself had been benched Vandenber and have got the shirts now and Collins has been benched three game weeks in a row so I do not think it's a given >> at all that Shard comes straight back in and as you said there because Lewis Potter scored >> in gameweek 26 takes um well effectively deputizing for Shard. So um it's not a certainly at all. So I think if you're going for Sharda or Dango, you go with Dango U this week because he got the shirt. He's y >> cheaper as well. >> Yeah. >> And as you pointed out, I think on a on a video earlier this week, he's got some decent stats. >> Yeah, I've already got Thiago in my side anyway, but I think I'm going to hold off a week while I see. But I think Dango is definitely on my radar, so we'll see. Um and as for Brighton, what's the latest there? Will he go for tried and tested good players or will he get some teenagers from Worththing out again? >> Yeah. >> Yeah. He's um he's in danger of losing the plas. That's why he's in danger. >> Yes. Yeah. Very much so. Yeah. Yeah. Not so much a teenager, but a longer style whitew. Yeah. He's had his own lengthy off about year is it? I can't remember how long it's actually been, but it's it's been very long time. >> Obviously, you're going to he's going to be on the bench first if he makes a squad, but he could be involved. He's returned to training. >> Um otherwise, no fresh concerns. >> Yasari is still out, but should return to training next week and then Webster and and Simo obviously longer. >> Okay. Righty. I wonder hopefully he'll bring a spare assist or goal. I think he's owed a few a couple from last was it well the last time he played um few years ago that wasn't it? >> Yeah. Uh Chelsea against Burnley. Uh this is this marks sort of the end of Chelsea's good run. So whilst I think with this one people are probably not going to invest wide widely in Chelsea, but they're going to stick with what they've got. But you never know they might do as well. But this is the LA the fixtures do drop off a cliff somewhat um after this Burnley game. Yeah, this is this is as good as it gets. Home to Burnley. It's got a a lucrative one on the uh on the fixture difficulty rating. I haven't seen that before. It's in a in a dark >> changed this week. >> Yeah, it's in a dark green which is like a kind of um it looks pretty disgusting actually. The color to to to merit the number the number one it's symbolizing. Uh Chelsea uh what's the latest? >> Both of these press conferences were yesterday so there's a danger of something happening in between. >> Mhm. But Rosena um was not much help on Cookerella. Reports suggest he's out for three to four weeks and Rosinia predictably wouldn't confirm that, but he did say that he was going to be out for this one. >> Okay. >> Um he did also say though that Palmer and James were fine. We didn't we didn't think otherwise, but um >> it's a weekly question now on his press conferences that uh you know if he's going to manage them. The thing is with this game there's a week's break on either side, so I don't think there's any danger of that. Both are fine. Gittens, Isugu, Cowwell, Modri are still out. Lavia is back in training, but he is playing for the under 21s this afternoon, so obviously he won't be involved. Uh, no update on Jorgensson, who's been described as close for, I think about three weeks now. Uh, and I think that's pretty much it. >> Okay. Right. And as for Burnley, >> yeah, Armando Broer won't be able to face his former club because he's joined the injury list with a an issue with unspecified. Twan is a couple of weeks away as well, same as Broa. And then the long-term ones are still out. Treso, Cullen, Bayer, Roberts, Amuni. Amuni and Treso are back on the grass. >> Okay. All right. Yeah. Let's move on to West Ham against Bournemouth, the home side. What's the latest from West Ham? >> I had another press conference from yesterday was was Nuno. Mhm. >> Just one named injury concern, Pablo Felipe. Again, much like Karella, um that the manager would not confirm a timeline, but it has been reported four to six weeks for him with the cough issue. Freddy Pots begins a three match ban. He was sent off in the FA Cup last weekend, but they do get Tibbo back from his own three game suspension. Uh Nuna says otherwise. Everyone else is is okay. We assume that doesn't include Fabianski, who's been out since November. >> Okay. Right. Yeah. And for Bournemouth as well, they could have a player or two back. Well, maybe one, at least one player. >> They could. Yeah. Marcus Diveria, who was very briefly, I think a bit of an FPL bandwagon. Uh, he has trained this week. He's been out for a month, so I'm not sure if he's going to be fit enough for this one, but if not this one, then the next one. >> Okay. >> 28. >> Um, apart from I think it's As you were private, so Ganond still out. >> Okay. And uh there was quite a lengthy bit of um uh answering from Eola on Ellie Krooppy. Um I'll refer people to the team's article website. It was basically just about how he's >> adding other things to his game bar goals >> like the offer ball stuff. So I'll refer people to the article on the website scout. >> So who do we think will start? I mean with it doesn't look like Tav will get this one but will be back long term. But so we think it'll be uh I mean Ryan Ryan um Aanson and >> Yeah. Yeah. Ryan, Adley in group. Uh yeah. I mean it's possible K is benched again because he was in in gameweek 26 I think was it the short turnaround? >> I think that was more minute management. Um but they have got Alex Toth now. They've got um Scott Christy Kall options in midfield. Adams is back as well. Tyler Adams. >> Okay. A lot of these are central midfielders, but some of them can play further forward. So, it's looking less sure than it was, but I think he may come back in. >> Okay. Uh, big news next from Man City. So, lots of us saw the the injury the yellow injury flag uh for Harland, but will he play this one? >> We didn't get a verbal confirmation, >> but we got a nod of the head, >> which is as Eric Idol Yeah. As Eric Idol says, isn't >> Yeah. Not as good as a wink to a blame to a blame pep. >> He got a got a nudge nudge and a wink wink. >> Exactly. Yes. >> Back. Yeah. Okay. Well done. >> He didn't he said he said no more about Parl, but he he did he did nod. He did nod when he was fit. >> That joke I just I was just going to say I mean that was that's before I was born and I'm ancient. >> Yeah. And me. Yeah. Yeah. >> So that so that's like about a 50-y old reference there. Anyway, we're down with the kids. >> Some Yeah. I've interrupted some bosses at scouts say we're not appealing enough to the teenagers but I think that just proves the theory. Yeah. >> Yeah. So Harland's fine. Cinho is okay as well. He's back after a spell out. >> Too soon for Du. He should be I think around about next week I think >> but not for this one. Gavardial and Kobach are out as well. Okay. >> Don't think we got an update on Max Elaine uh who came off last weekend. It was a very very brief press conference only eight minutes in length. Uh, lots of praise for so many of you. Um, and then there's a broadcast section to come tonight, so there might be some more stuff then. >> I think I'm going to keep the armband on Harlem, Ben. Uh, Harland against your side, Newcastle. Um, but Thiago for Bentford's a good shout as well. Um, and obviously if you got Cole Palmer, he could be a good one as well to Burnley. Um, yeah, Newcastle. Yeah. Um, am I justified in putting the armband on Harland? What's what's the state of Newcastle? Yeah, better than it was because Spotman is in and around it. He could return this weekend. It's just too soon for Lewis Miley and Yuan Whissa. Miley is still one or two weeks away with a dead leg/ muscle issue. Yuan Whissa should be back possibly for Carabag next week which is just a knock with him. >> Fabian Shiver, Bruno and Craft still longer term. Livermento will be the soonest of those lot back in March. Bruno's out until uh until April and Julian and he came back in the squad in midweek. He's fine >> and I think that's it. >> Okay. Right. Um Crystal Palace against Wolves. I mean talking about my manager, my team's manager um on borrowed time, but um yeah, could be for the manager of Crystal Palace as well. Um they're not in a good run of form and I hear that there may be some talks going on about that issue at the moment. So, um, what's the latest for Crystal Palace in terms of players and also anything about potential managerial departure? >> Yeah, well, obviously we know Glasgner's leaving at the end of the season at the latest. Um, but that could be brought forward. He was he was booed and barricked by his own supporters last night. I think it's one win 15 for Palace >> in all competitions. And reportedly, according to Fabricio Romano, there's there's talks between the board and Glasnner to terminate his appointment a lot earlier than initially planned. Glazer did face the media this morning. >> Um after those reports uh came out and he said he didn't really put the rumors to bed. He said um he said we'll see. Let's see what the future brings. You never know when >> asked if he'll still be the manager at the end of the season. >> He said he still felt like he had the drive to to continue. Um but it might be taken out of his hands by by the palace board. We'll see. >> Okay. >> As for the players, um Laqua, this is a bit of a blow if you got Max Laqua. >> Uh he suffered an adductor injury on Thursday night in the Conference League. No further update this this morning really from Glasnet, but he did say that yesterday it looked like he'll miss out. >> Um it it doesn't look good. Further assessment will follow today and tomorrow, but um I think uh that doesn't bode well. And in fact later on in the press he says we're going to have to change the back three again. So that seems like he's out. >> Okay. >> Um Chhatty Riyad came off with cramp button said everyone else looked fine from last night's game. No one's going to be back though. So Meta is out for another two three weeks. LMAS out for three weeks and Keck is out for a few more weeks as well. Dori is back in training but he's been out for a year. So I think it's going to be a while before he's playing and that's it I think. >> Okay. So, who would be at back then? Obviously, I'm trying to remember who's left now. Um, Richard, >> who else? >> Canvo um will possibly come in. Um, Riyad if he's if he's >> fit enough to start twice in 72 hours. That'll be the back three. If not, Glasna mentioned Mitchell as an option as a as a center half. So, >> okay. >> Potentially Canvo, Richard's Mitchell or Riad if he's fit. Yeah. And then if Mitchell is needed at center half, then Bora Saucer at left wing back. >> Okay. Ratio. Um, and what's the latest from Wolves? >> Yeah, quick turnaround from uh Wednesday. Um, and Gomez, one of the many Gomez, Angel Gomez, >> he's going to make a swift return. Uh, despite coming off of a back issue on Wednesday, he's trained, so he's fine. Okay, >> another Gomez, Totty Gomez, he might be back as well. He's been out for two months, I think. Uh, he's trained, so could be back in the group. I think that just leaves Huang in terms of the senior absentees. He's out, but we'll return to training next week. >> Okay. Right. Oh, sorry. >> I've got news on a third Gomez. I've forgotten on Wednesday, but he had a hip issue and remained unused. I'll be hon It's good job Wolves are a bit rubbish this season because I would have a nightmare trying to get any of their players in. Like every week I'll be think, oh, I'll get this play. Oh, I got the wrong one. Um there was a >> that must have happened this season with all the >> Gourmes. Yeah, definitely. And the Buenos as well. >> The Buenos. >> Okay. Uh Nottingham Forest and Liverpool. I haven't seen anything from Nottingham Forest. So, is there anything? >> No, I haven't either. That was the one near missing from uh the um press conferences this morning. I think because he was up and out of his chair last night after the after the presser. I think he was doing um a separate written section for the sorry for the written press, >> but that hasn't come out yet that far aware. Um what we did know, Milo came back last night and was part of that squad that won 3-0. Uh and I think it's just the longerterm ones who are out. So it wasn't anything obvious from last night. >> Um Matt SS, Savona, Wood, John, >> and By the five were red flag. I didn't don't think there's anything new. >> Is was there any information from uh last night in terms of potential lineups or lineup changes or formation changes, strategy, that kind of thing? >> Yeah, it was all very dishian. It looked exactly the same as what he he done before. So, it was a 42-31 with all the usual suspects there who you'd think would be there. So, like the back four, Anderson and Sangaria midfield, Gibbs White behind the striker, it was ego last night. Uh and then Hutchinson and Hutson are joining the Frank. So it looked very similar to what went before but they won 3-0. >> Right. Yeah. Okay. Um Liverpool, what's the latest sir? >> Yep. Slot was up yesterday actually unusually for him and he confirmed that it's too soon for Fong. He should be back next week. So he's nearing a return. Isak is on the grass but we're looking at the other side of the March international break for him. So Ekit is safe for him till April. >> Good night. Endo has joined the injury list and he's going to be out for a long time. Bradley Leone uh there also sidelineed I think for the rest of the season. Joe Gomez is back. I mean he's been on the bench for the last couple of games after a minor issue and slot said he could start and Shabbos he was absent in gameweek 26 through suspension but he came back in the FA Cup last weekend. >> Okay. Right. So obviously if Gomez comes back uh at right back then be a good option midfield. Uh less of a good option if he's at right back though. Um, okay. Sunderland against Fulham. Once again, Sunderland. I've not seen anything from there. So, is there any Sunderland information? >> There is quite a bit of it actually. Quite some interesting stuff for FPL managers who've got the budget defenders. There's three updates on the budget defender. >> Okay. Far away. >> Um, start with the bad news. If you got Ronaldo, he's going to be out for the next three to four weeks with a knee injury. >> Okay. >> Uh, but the other ones are looking better. Alder who I've got um he has been struggling with a niggling foot issue for a while and he was rested in the FA Cup last weekend. >> Yeah. >> But he is okay according to Libra this afternoon. >> Good. He's in my team. >> And uh Muki Elli. Yeah, Muki Elli. I didn't I wasn't aware of this. Um >> he has had a hand injury uh of late and apparently he's not been on long throws, but it's that's the only thing that's stopping him from taking long throws rather than rendering him out. >> Okay. So he's been playing wi with it. So it's nothing new. Okay. >> And Li said this afternoon that he hopes he'll regain the ability to chuck the balls into the box soon. Um further good news for Sunderland. Grant and Jack is back. >> That's a big boost for them. >> Yeah. Fantast. >> Yeah. Well, yeah, very much so. Yeah. And he's a bit of a def machine himself. So he's back in the in the midfield mix. Treyor should be back next weekend. Uh he's not quite ready. >> Okay. Right. Okay. Yeah, that is big news there. you when you said that about the budget m defenders were saying please say elder is fine >> okay Fulham uh what's the latest there >> I've not seen I've not seen um Silva's press conference uh in person yet but I have read the headlines from it and Luc and Kane are back in training so I think one of them could be involved I think Silva was hinting at >> Chuck Reesei is out however >> okay two more to go uh Tottenham North London derby Tottenham against Arsenal Um what's the latest from Tottenham? A new boss there as well. Any hints of changes as well? >> I don't think he's going to have much choice but to to keep it relatively the same. Uh because he's still got I think we make it 11 players injured and then one suspended. That player who suspended is Romero. He's serving a four match ban. Won't be battle gameweek 30. >> Um so yeah, the long-term ones and the short-term ones. Ego Tudtor said they're not expecting anyone back. So order bear doggy danso bergval davies spent ker kudus madison kuruski porro and rashison all out parro and rashson I think are the closest I think rashson was even on the grass this week >> but apparently none of them are expected back was uh also a doubt I think briefly but um it was only illness by the sounds of it a minor throat issue >> but he's trained on Friday so expect him to be fine so they were training with 13 players according to the the new manager Okay. Yeah. I mean, I didn't quite realize how quite how bad it was actually with the um uh injuries list there. So, yeah, very unfortunate. Uh Arsenal, what's the latest there? >> Yeah, Art said he's got no fresh concerns from midweek. So, that suggests that Saka's all right. He he got a a wall up to the foot and then came off. >> He seemed all right when he came off. He was he sort of laughing and jerking with a physio. >> Uh and our confirmed Trosard was the other doubt. Uh he's fine. He was like he took his shoulder to the face >> and came off in stoppage time, but he's he's fine. And there's a big possibility, those were Arteta's words, that Odigard and Havitz returned for this one as well. >> Um so I think that just leaves um Mikuel Mourinho on the sidelines because I think even even um Max Dman's back in as well. >> Wow. Okay. Rightyo very contrasting fortunes there on injuries. Uh last game Everton against Manchester United the Monday night game. Um yeah what's latest from Everton? >> Pretty quiet on the injury front at Everton as well. Uh they've got just one absentee in terms of injuries. That's Jack Greish. They do have one other player red flag though and that's through suspension. Jo Bryan was sent off last weekend or last scheme week. So he'll serve a one match back. >> Okay. Righty. U Manchester United. Um yeah. any any updates there about anything? >> Yeah, nothing nothing uh exciting really. Um Mount and Delic are the two closest to a comeback. Mount being the nearest. >> Mhm. >> But nothing really concrete from Karaki just said he was getting closer. You don't want to force anything but he's he's the nearest to a return. Delic a little bit behind him and then Patrick Dogy was out longer term. He's he's probably another two months I think for him. Yeah. Harry McGuire, he's been training since game 26. So, um the knock he picked up doesn't seem to amount into much. >> Okay. Right. I'll try and round up most of the key things there. So, available we got stack strike uh and James as well could be back leads. Uh Harland uh is is fine. We've had a nod uh that he's fine there. Sinho is available. Botman available. Uh Sully March is available. Uh one of the Gomezes and Angel Gomez. Um, Lucich and Carney, they're available. Sheamus Coleman, that's rolling back the years. Uh, I remember when he scored when my um, youngest son was born, which is a long time ago. He's well teenager now. Um, and Matty Cash back. Questionable though. Ta is technically back, but probably give me 28 for him. Slanky should be in the available one. He's had illness, but you know, there's always, you know, maybe the snipples keep him out, but he's pretty much available there. Um, Havitz and Ode are big possibilities. That's in quote marks. Major doubts. Vissa's unlikely to feature with a knock. Same with Mai with a leg problem. Definitely out. Bruya is out for Burnley injured. Kucarella's got hamstring problems. Okafer's out with a hamstring. Frimong going to be game 28. We think he's back. Each just an update there. He's not going to be back until April. So, Ekit is safe. Lrao has got an abductor is going to keep him out. We don't know how long. For Lurma is three weeks away. Mateta's two to three weeks away. Ayara should be back next week for Brighton. Chuka ways he was going to miss out this week. Greish, little update there. His season's over. O'Brien is suspended for Everton. Marco Bizo, Marco Bizo, he's suspended as well. So, um I think we've got most things there. >> Are you sure, Julia? >> Right. Excellent. Um thanks much for joining me. Um thanks so much everyone joined us in the live chat. Thanks everyone for watching and listening. Good luck with your game week. We'll see you again next week. Take care. See you soon. Bye for now."

      "transcript": "Hi everyone. Welcome to Final Fours ahead of gameweek 27. Hopefully everyone watching is well. And guess who's back this week? Oh my god, look who's back. Braz, what's going on? >> What do you mean guess who's back? Where did I go? >> Well, rumor has it you was jet setting around the world whenever it's international break. >> I was here for Gimig 26. I'm here for Gimig 27. If you want to have mid pods like talking about I don't know what then what you like I >> we had >> we had a lovely show PR I was about to say we had a lovely show I don't know if you heard the intro >> I heard the intro >> it's good fun >> I heard the intro and uh also you guys were poding during the first game of the the famous double game or was it the second game and uh I also remember the pain when the clean sheet got wiped so yes I did check it out. >> Good, good, man. That's what I like to say. And Sam was a lovely guest. Hopefully, we'll have her back on whenever you're sitting again, PR, which won't be, you know, >> whenever we have a podcast, which is not actually a final thought. >> Okay, I get what you're trying to say, but uh you've touched on it. Double game week 26. I know normally in the show we only focus on looking forward, but we have to because it was a first double big double game week. Um what do what do you think, Pratt? How did that go? was success failure failure man it was a look it's all relative right um so I would say if you were on triple defense and triple captain that's a failure right because not only did they lose their clean sheet twice timber and rya didn't didn't do anything if you were on Gabrielle captain but double defense and rice then actually it was quite all right right I mean that that went as well as it well it could have gone better. But then if because you didn't use your triple captain, Rice got the points instead of the defenders. So that worked out. I was in the middle. I used my triple captaincy, but I had Rice instead of Timber, for example. And so I felt like it was okay. Now had Gabriel like it's always sometimes also if you look at seven points, you say, \"Oh, that was a failure.\" But if you contextualize seven points where Gabriel could have got a red card, he could he conceded in both games but ends up with a with an assist in defcon. So he gets two returns. So you're like, you know what, it's not the end of the world. Like if let's say Holland gets a double game week, right? And he goes mad. He he scores in both games, scores 20 points. You lost 13 points. It's not season ending, right? Like 13 points is what Stan Larson scored this It's not it's not a big deal, you know. It's it's so >> Look at that little flex. That little flex there. I love it. >> So So what what I'm trying to say is it's not a disaster. Like there have been double game weeks where your player gets injured in the first game or doesn't play the second game, doesn't start the second game, and you end up with seven to 10 points and you say, \"Yeah, whatever.\" Of course, it would have been nice to get a clean sheet. Would have been nice to hit 10 10 to 12 points, but again, I'm not going to complain with seven. If if Gabriel had ended up getting a red card, zero in the first game, no assist, and one point in the second game, and you're thinking, \"Oh man, this is less than four points.\" That's a disaster. So, it wasn't a disaster. We've used the chip and we move on. >> So, by the sounds of it, you don't regret it. It is what it is, basically, prize. These things can happen. And I can testify. I used my triple captain. I think I've said it loads of times on Harland when he got six. Was it two points? So, there you go. So, I agree with you. It could be it could definitely be worse. I don't think it's that bad. But more importantly, what what is um we should touch on them actually before we even get into our teams. What is happening with Arsenal? Is this um cuz both games we we fought at least one clean sheet press. There's been none and they've actually not won those games either conceding which impacted their the the title potentially. What do you think is happening of Arsenal? Well, look, I can give you a very creative story about how in transition they're getting, you know, caught out or on the right hand side something is happening or I can tell you that the odds of them conceding in both games are 29%. I mentioned this and you know what 29% events happen. They're not zero. So, a 29% event happened is what I would say about it. Now, you can add layers to this that are they bottling it? Are they doing all of this? Of course, there's some nerves kicking into it. Like, would they have if this was a one-off game, would they have tried to sort of close the shop in the 94th minute and all the players getting head injuries? No, I don't think so. Arsenal would have gone for the jugular. They were the much better team, but there is some nervousness kicking in. They're top of the league, but the lead is slipping. And they concede. It's unfortunate. I think they conceded 0.36 xG in the whole game. They concede two goals. Sometimes bad luck happens as well. So I I have my sympathies with people on multiple Arsenal defenders in FPL, but also Arsenal fans, right? I mean, it is one of those games where Arsenal should have won. >> Totally agree with you. Um before we even go into our teams, um I'm going to give you the opportunity cuz I saw the little flex he done with Strand Lson. >> Oh, it was a good example, man. >> Yeah, it was example. Yeah, I bet it was. And it hurts me because I'm I'm going to tell you about the story where I nearly went Strand Lson as well, but uh we'll get back to that later on. So you'd rather have got Strand Larson and triple captain than done neither. Correct. >> Yes. >> So that's the example where triple captaincy is not the end of the world guys. Like don't sulk if it happens. >> Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree. I don't think it's me as I think as I've experienced a bad triple captain already this season as we get two sets. I don't think it's that bad. That's the tr truth of it. >> So uh I was giving you an opportunity to stunt. You've had a very nice good game week and we've not had many this season price. You've had a very good week. I I'm not going to be one of those people that gloat when they have a great game week when most of the weeks I've been complaining. I'm not going to do that. I'm not I look I've break I've broken into the top million. That's all I'll say. So, it's still an embarrassing rank and there's no denying it. But yeah, it was good to get points from Van Djk who has not done much all season. Um good to get points from Stan Larson and who else did well? Hill. James Hill. So, that that was really it. And then obviously I talked about Rice versus getting a third Arsenal defender. So things worked out this week. But in no way am I saying am I victory lapping or anything? It was just a good week. Lots lots of ground to make up if I have to hit my goal of top 100k. >> Have Have you not readjusted that goal and for top 10k? No in you ps if anyone can. >> No. >> If you have a game like this every week if you have a game week like this for the remainder of the season >> everyone you you strike the jackpot. No. Do you know my gameweek overall gameweek rank even though I got what 94 points or something wasn't that high because I don't have Xiao Pedro I don't have Simeno like the kind guys who keep doing points >> so like it was good but it was not amazing so firstly probabilistically speaking it's not going to happen that every game week goes like this I'll probably have two more game weeks like this and that's enough if you want to hit a top 100k and not get very unlucky I'm not saying it's possible but it's still a stretch target which I want to achieve. 3 weeks ago I was 2 million. So if there's anybody else who has a bad season who wants to take some inspiration, sure. I mean I've gone from 2 million to 800K. 800K is embarrassingly low. I've never been 800k in my life uh by gameweek 25 or wherever we are. But listen, this is not gluting up. Giving inspiration more. Come on. >> Yeah. Yeah. Praise. And you're stunting a little bit. Just a little bit. But what? >> But to be fair, but no, you are actually >> such humility. Yeah. No, >> you you are right to be fair, press, you are right. >> I can't set you up like that and then then actually take it away. No, you're totally right. And hope hopefully you actually >> the remainder of the season goes well for you. I really hope so. And you spoke about inspiration. I I hope I can take some from it. I I could do with a couple of those weeks. I think I've had one this season. I I hope for a couple more. So, not bad. Well done, Pra. I had to mention it. I know we always look forward. You're not keen on worrying about what's already happened. Now we can >> but but tell me something about yourself. Uh you didn't triple captain and you had some regrets. So should we talk about those looking at your team or before? >> Um all right. No I can talk to you uh before the regret one. I'll tell you what what exactly what happened press. So I do a deadline stream and uh just before I was I was thinking I'm going to roll even though I wasn't that comfortable with my team if I'm totally honest with you. I was going to roll that was in my head but then someone came on and gave me and it was a good idea and you know what when you calculate how good it would have been. So the idea I had two transfers was it two? No I would have to take a minus four but I could have bought Kane for heel and Mark Gooey for Strand Lson. Do you know how juicy that would have been? >> I do that. >> You do know cuz you have both of them. It would have been it would have been gorgeous and it it made sense and I'm not quite sure and I think it just sums up this season that maybe when a move is that good I still doubt it. I I really don't know. I thought it was a sensible to to come into this game week with two transfers PZ but it it backfired. Not bad. My gameweek wasn't like very like hideous but it wasn't great either. That would have been how much more points is that? 20 points >> you know. >> That would have been 13 and 9 22 and your guy scored what? Uh, not much, right? >> Not much at all. Yeah. Yeah. Not much at all. >> But look, look, look, look. What I'll say is there's a lot of luck involved with this. So, you can't be as hindsighty, right? I mean, Hill getting an assist, like come on. Which defender gets an assist that frequently? Strand Larson, like Crystal Palace was so poor. I'm going to talk about Crystal Palace in more detail when I come to my team. But tonight, they played and they were really poor. I I've been on Crystal Palace forums for the last two hours after the game. People are like, \"Sack, Glasgner. uh you know we're going to lose to Wolves. Now of course fans can overreact but it's not a happy place. >> So of course the punt worked but other people punted on Sar Munos. It didn't work right. So it's not like it was a banker you it was going to be one of those things. It's just one of those things. Ran Lassson gets two shots he gets two goals. So don't beat yourself too much about it. Saving a transfer versus a hit is never objectively wrong. >> Yeah. No, and I was thinking I was thinking especially as it came late to be fair and it's one one of the permutations I had like two potential moves that I normally just I blame it not having a final thought for before the deadline cuz you would have probably put it into my head like oh no maybe that move is the one which you done so I might have done it but anyway it came in late and I thought let me roll but when I did see him >> score I talked to you about Stan Larson in the final thoughts. >> Yeah yeah yeah I did see you know yeah you did but do you know how much textes I got? You know how it works? Do you know everyone messaged me because I was saying about Shrine last night I was going to do it and then he banged in two goals. My phone was exploding. I had to go put it in the in the washing machine. But uh honestly anyway it's gone now. So it's all good. But um yeah >> there was a bit of regret there per I will be honest to be a little bit >> but let me um let me run you through my team. Let me show you my team. So this is what >> 2.8 million in the bank. That's why I had flexibility and I had two free transfers. Okay, I've got two free chances now. Sorry. So, Rya in goal versus Tottenham away, which all of a sudden it's becoming a very interesting game. New manager of Tottenham, which we might touch on later. >> Mukui versus Fulham at home. Gabrielle O'Reilly versus Newcastle at home. >> Rise, >> right? It went for you. You started him, right? >> I started press. Yeah, that's what You know what? Can I be honest? That kind of saved me. It really did. >> It really Yeah. So that's what I'm saying. I try my best not to just always look at the negative. That was a big positive. So I agree with you ma'am. >> Rice, Enzo, Bruno Fernandez, Rogers and Wilson. Up top, Harlon, Ekatik on the bench, the Bravka, Keane, Raldon, and Mark Guey. Okay. Now, there's a couple of ideas I've got here actually, maybe three, and I'm going to run them by you first actually to get your opinion. So I think the most sensible one press I've got a very this is this could be right up your street and you know what it is it's I can actually do with the money I've got in the bank I can do Mark Guie straight to Thiago >> straight away which looks beautiful and then I could rest pick one of the mid picks but someone like Wilson who's not been firing even his minutes against Man City were a bit lower maybe I'm a little bit concerned >> and some away is hard man like it's a very difficult game >> but it's not as easy as it looks >> totally agree and they've got Oscar Bob now. You know, there's it's a bit of options making me a little bit nervous there. Just just a bit more than I was buoyant with him before cuz he was he was doing bits for me. So, that's the first move. I could I could add to it cuz I've got two free transfers. I could fix Keen as well, Pra, and bring in Hill, your boy who has been a revelation for you in the last three game weeks >> now. But why would you fix Hill? Because you're not going to play him over Mabel. >> I'm not. So that's the reason I said to you that was the second part of u the move that that that's not necessary. It would be necessary if Thiago went up though press. So bear that in mind because I think the money is exactly on the dot now. I checked earlier. Thiago is not planning on going up. Okay. >> He's he's not he's not close. So don't worry. >> No exactly about. So exactly that. But so one of the reasons was if he did go up what would I do? Keen to heal frees up the money and leaves me with 0.3. The other reason for Keane, you saw what he done to me this week as you you saw. Yeah, P. Yeah, I mean it >> was brutal. >> It was mate, he walked onto the pitch and the referee blew the whistle. He didn't even He didn't even get one death. It lit it was brutal to be fair. To be fair, Perez, he only blocked one extra point because Melli got two. So when you look at it like that again, if Muki was on the bench with a nine-pointer, >> but you know Nema uh you know FPL Nema. Yeah, of course. Of course I know Nemo. >> He had O'Reilly auto subbing for Keen. >> But for Keen to come on like those are brutal. Like brutal. >> That that would have broke me. You would be It would have been you and Sam this week. I would have been I would have been away. I would have beat that. Seriously, I would have been on the ropes. I would have been on the ropes. Honestly, Praz So that's one of the reasons I'm thinking to fix him. He confused me. We played the first week where we had we thought it's a risky he's going to start then didn't start this one. Now they've got the red card. Am I right? Did they get a red card? >> I think. Was it straight red? I think >> am I going crazy? Everton got a red card. Wasn't it one of their right back? Was it Was it O'Brien or someone? I can't remember off my head. Which it's making me think, does he start this game week? I'm sure Everton got a red card, press I don't know if he can remember. >> Game week some time ago. Yeah, they got >> Exactly. >> Yeah. But uh that's making me think maybe he could start. >> But maybe I just make him second bench at least Raldon starts against Villa. So you know and then save that transfer and have two next week. Is that what you think Pres? >> That's what I think because I've got I've got three moves for you. >> Okay. >> Not all this week. >> So Enzo from next week is rubbish, >> right? He's going to become he's going to go into Arsenal and then tough for fixtures. He's anyway rubbish when Palmer is getting more minutes because he's not on penalties anymore. I mean, I don't want to say rubbish, but you know, he's not the same. >> So, he's a sell next week. >> So, you have two choices now. Next week. So, first this week, by the way, I know we're supposed to talk a lot and discuss a lot. It's a no-brainer to do Thiago, right? Like, don't worry about it. Do it tomorrow night. Do it Saturday morning or whatever. The only reason for you to wait is wait till Saturday morning and see if there's a leak on Holland or not, right? Because Holland has been 50/50. Like he's in training and everything. I'm expecting him to play. >> But sometimes when he's not playing, those leaks come. Remember the last time it happened. >> So I would wait last minute. >> And if Harland is not playing, then you could do Harland to Thiago instead of Gui to Thiago. And then next we get Salah even or do something, right? So that would be one thing and I'm going into actually my team because that's something that I'm looking to hold and do later. >> But let's assume Holland is playing or there's no leak which is the likeliest scenario then I think Guei to Thiago and benching Wilson I think sounds good. Now Wilson can hurt you but we are taking an objective call here where Thiago should be good >> and you want him now until your wild card anyway for long term. >> So I think that's a transfer you just make for next week. Now you have two choices. You can do Keen down to hill and Enzo up to someone. That up to somebody could be let's say Keen will get you.5 and then Enzo up to 7.3 million. I don't think there's anybody else unless you want to go through the >> you don't want to go through the Gordon trauma again. So maybe it's uh >> I own Gordon Shard is it? >> Both of them two are good options >> or a Bournemouth mid. Um, you could get Ryan or uh Adley or you could get even Anderson. Like I know it's a boring pick, but what needs to be solved is who do you want as your defender for Keen if you wanted to go up? Are you interested in Van Djk for example? >> Van Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. And not just because of the the points more because more because of playing West Ham at home next week, right? Yeah. So next week if you did Enzo down to What gets you keen up to Van Djk is what you need to tell me. >> Oh, I see your I see your point. How about I to do that? I haven't test I haven't tested that permutation. That was >> I think those are the three moves because then if I look at your team, you you're you're in pretty good shape now for the upcoming whatever blank team looks great. You need to deal with O'Reilly and Rice at some point, but that's fine. Like O'Reilly can become Anderson. Rice can become Imbumo if you want later. Like those are transfers that you can make much later, but the team looks fine. Absolutely great. >> So, let me ask you, I've got some questions I always have saved. Um, and one of them was regarding O'Reilly. Me and you a couple weeks back, we already highlighted him as a potential risk. Eight Nory and Man City's clean sheets and he wasn't looking that great. All of a sudden, he's playing in midfield. He's getting I don't know if you saw the last game, it's five shots, Brad. >> Yep. >> Five shots. Very impressive. Does does that make him now maybe we have to reconsider it and look to keep him especially as Man City. >> Yeah, >> you should keep him. Like I So Luke disabled did this thread where he was talking about how his physicality in the central midfield is an important aspect of it compared to Rinders. He's essentially playing the Rinders role. So you've got a you've got the old Rinders is back in your team, but he's playing defense and he gets defensive points and he can still score a goal for you. That's a good spot to be in. So, I don't think you need to rush to to move him on or or do anything with him until, of course, playing game week 31 where you may think about using that spot for something else. One more thing that I've just noticed. >> You can do Rice and Enzo to a Bournemouth mid and WS. >> Yeah, that's that I've looked at that already. I've been I've been playing around with those permutations for the upcoming weeks 100%. Verts definitely an option. Definitely an option. for those fixtures. I'm going to want to take advantage of them, especially for me. I'm going to need a couple of players who are not highly owned as well, PR. And I do like the look of that as well. I think it's affordable as well. That is affordable cuz I played around earlier on today with some moves. >> I've got another move you've not mentioned, so clearly you do not fancy it. This one is a bit more. >> It would have probably your street. >> No, no, no. >> By the way, is a good pick. You're just bench. don't like him. >> I know. I remember carefully. I remember when you benched him that weekend and he had a big haul. I I >> didn't bench him. I couldn't bring him on when that Holland news broke and then he hauls >> anyway. And he missed a pen for me. >> I I I remember >> there's a reason I hate him. >> He he is a class player playing so well. That's a >> He is the most goodlooking, classiest player in the like sometimes I look at him playing and I'm like, how does this guy have talent, looks, money, how like how how do people have like he has everything? So anyway, now we digress. >> Yeah, but I'm in agreement as well. Top player, so >> now let me say the move that you haven't mentioned. So I think you're going to you're going to bat this out the window. And this is very I think this is desperation for points. And cuz where I am rank wise, >> Wilson. >> No, that wasn't it. But more about who do you think will be coming in? I think this week here, Pra, who would I be desperate to bring in? >> Don't get >> Yeah, there you go. There you go. And captain him. Pra, >> what that move does though, it breaks this team. What I've just explained to you a minute ago is thoughtful. It's a bit more long-term to wild card. If I bring Palmer in, it kills Thiago. It really it stops that move and it stops like flexibility goes out the window. But I was thinking is that I could easily do uh Palmer in to one of these midfielders. Take up Rice who's going to become a Rice is is it going to become a problem with the double the blank? We can >> wait. You can do Rice to Palmer. How >> uh Rice? No, I have to get rid of someone else as well, don't I? I'm sure I tested it earlier on, but I can I'm sure I can. Was it Was it Rogers? All right, let me check it right now. Actually, maybe I'm saying stuff that doesn't exist, >> dude. I mean, if you can do it for one transfer, fair enough. >> Let me Let me see. Let me see. Maybe I'm imagining stuff. Present. I'm I'm just saying this and it doesn't even exist. I'm I'm testing it right now. Apologies, guys. I should have had this all planned. >> This is This is zero. Oh, it's 0.3 short, but then Keen to heal fixes that. You see, >> Keen to Keen to heal all of a sudden the bench is better. I've probably got the best captain who we're going to talk about later on for this game week who not a lot of people are going to own. The big problems of this here again, no Thiago PZ. The other problem is I've got Enzo and Burnley, sorry, Enzo and Palmer next week against Arsenal which is grim. Okay, you see what I mean? All of a sudden now I'm playing >> I look for one two sides of it. >> Yeah, go on. Yeah. >> The one side of it is the dreamer side which you're dreaming right now. that Palmer scores a hat-tick, you captain him, Enzo assists him and Harland or Bruno, whoever the masses captain are going to blank. So you're like, I make 40 points in one week and then who cares? But often in the dreamer scenario, there's also the other scenario which is the more likely scenario that Palmer does all right, gets a goal and assist, let's say. In fact, that's better than all right, >> that's good. >> But then Holland also gets a goal. So it's maybe Palmer outscores him by four points. So you double that. Okay, eight points. So you got a differential captain return. You did what you thought you'll get, but you've absolutely screwed up your team or your transfer. You've used up two transfers to get those four extra points. And now you're behind where next game week Thiago is home to Burnley or away to Burnley, whatever. And you're like, how do I get this guy now? I have Palmer away to I have one free transfer. I've got Palmer. I've got Enzo. I don't have Thiago. I don't have a Liverpool mid. And so and then there's a third scenario I haven't talked about in which Palmer actually doesn't do that well and Harland actually does score and then you're like I'm going to shut down and delete my team. >> Three scenarios out of the three scenarios the only one in which this works is if he completely goes berserk and Harland does not do anything. Is it possible? Of course it's possible. But do we overplay it in our minds on how much that is likely? I think you overplay it a lot. >> Yeah. So >> I I will be doing that prize in my head. I would be. Yeah. >> I have to give you the sensible answer. If Palmer had three good fixtures now and you say, \"Okay, I'm going to captain him in all three.\" Now, I think you're a little late to the party is the unfortunate point. >> So, or if you had five free transfers, then I would say, \"Okay, use blow two up just to chase that one scenario.\" You're using both of them up >> and then ending up with a not a great team next week. I know that's why I thought I knew you would I knew you wouldn't like it but as I said it was the dreamer in me and you are so right the three scenarios and the way my season's going mine would be the nightmare scenario Palmer plays 10 minutes groin comes off Harland seven goals I I can see it already I I can see it guys I'm >> I also want to say because I know what's going to happen in the comments Palmer's going to score a brace and I'll go people will go haha Palmer brace Palmer brace Palmer is a great option this week he's the best captain this week but my job is to show that it's not a guarantee. Everybody thought Arsenal will keep one clean sheet against Wolves or Brenford. What happened? They didn't. So these scenarios which we think in our head are going to happen sometimes don't happen because 20 30% probability events happen. So you just have to take that with a pinch of salt. Then you have to add like if if you own Palmer 100%. In fact, if somebody owns Palmer is not captaining, I would genuinely go and check with them on what the hell are they doing with this game? >> Because he is the best captain this week. There's no doubt about it. >> Buy him for one week using two transfers. No. >> What about though? We get the news Harland is out. You spoke about that scenario earlier on. Is that still don't make Palmer feasible? Go for it. You reckon that? You reckon then? Go for it. Yeah. Then Harland to Thiago and straight to it doesn't have to be um I could take Enzo to Palmer one Chelsea player >> in that in that scenario. What you should do is do Harland to Thiago. >> Yeah. >> Still do rice to Palmer because then now you'll have enough money to do Palmer to Salah next week. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> Then you chase the Salah captaincy when he's home to West Ham. >> 100%. Yeah. >> In that case, I get what you're trying to do here. And in that case, you're on Palmer cap, Salah cap, Salah cap, Salakap, then wild card. I get it. >> Now that's ultra differential and that's sexy. And you're only doing one extra transfer to get Palmer >> one week before you get Salah. >> I don't mind that. >> Yeah. So, let's hope they don't get the news with Harland. I mean, it's very unlikely. I mean, with Man City going to be buoyant with Arsenal dropping those points, I think he will be >> I don't think so. I don't think so even praise they will be ready to go mate but that's that's my moves I think the most sense even I would agree that's why I said it first I thought you would you you'd like that move gooey to to Thiago I think is most likely prize and then maybe hold a transfer makeon first sub you know and >> yeah hold a transfer you need two next week you need two next week >> you can do Rice because you need to do Enzo and you need to take out either Rice or Keen I think doing Any two of those three will be good moves. >> Actually, I'd have Wilson first sub. I'd have the luxury because obviously Oh, yeah. That makes the team even better. Okay. All right. I think for me that that makes perfect sense. But man, I'm a dreamer that Palmer the Palmer could enter the team. Let's see. >> We are all dreamers. And this is why people will rightly say that the way I play it's hard to win FPL because I don't I to get all three scenarios, not the dreamer scenario. To win FPL, you need to dream for 38 weeks and >> and hit them and hit them. Basically, you need to actually hit them. I I agree with you, PR, >> but your scenario is what stacks up those uh those good finishes. Cool. Okay. I think that is actually my team and we we can get to yours. Captaincy, we leave it to you. Okay. So, you got more stuff going on. >> You've got Captain Bruno. We're not going to let it go. >> Yes. So, this was one way. >> I I think I'm going to go for it, Prize. Yeah. This was one way. I'll tell you why the justification. So, if I'm not doing the Palmer move and I'm dreaming, this is my way of potentially a bit of dreaming. Now, could it end the wrong way? Like you said, a nightmare. Yeah, of course it could. But I think I will go for it. If Harland's um I don't know. I think I'll take it on. Yeah. Why do you think that's really crazy the way Newcastle have been? >> Do you think because Newcastle have been conceding? >> I'm not saying it's crazy. All I'm saying is this week Harland is at home >> against Newcastle who've been poor like very poor. >> They have been poor. They have been poor >> and and Man City can smell the title, right? So >> it's and Everton away I know Bruno likes to play Everton but Everton away Moyes against his own old club parking the bus. You just don't know >> how Man United play against a team that don't like possession. So that's my worry. Now, next week, next week I'll be on Bruno Captain myself because next week. >> Yeah, let's look at it. >> Yeah, let's have a look. So, >> I'll be on Bruno captain two out of the next four weeks. >> Oh, interesting. So, okay. So, you began against even though Holland. I'm sure Holland has good fixtures in the last two before the blank. Am I right? So Harland is away to leads next week >> which I'm happy to take on with Bruno home to home to Crystal Palace and Crystal Palace I've already mentioned are looking very poor >> and then again >> very good >> well I think Nottingham Forest and West Ham you captain Holland and then in gamewick 31 again of course Holland is blanking most likely >> Bruno at Bournemouth is is great so I think those are two opportunities to go against him >> there's a possibility Harland has this is sounds crazy he has slowed down recently I mean he still returned of course but if but but I he's crazy standards he's calmed a little given us the confidence to be able to take him plus with this sort of fitness concern I think he might play if they're winning two three nil price he comes off 70th minute you reckon >> possibly >> they do have a lot of games coming up so it's possible >> but I have to say they have a clear midweek like they have no games am I right in saying this uh because next week is the second leg of the of the Yeah. So, Holland had a clear midweek rest. >> Yeah. >> He has a weekend game against Newcastle and then he has a midweek again free. So, there's no reason for him not to play 90 minutes. >> Yeah, you're right. Yeah. >> Whereas Newcastle played an away game. >> Yeah. >> And have another game in in midweek. Now, of course, Newcastle are well up in that game. So, they will now completely rest their team against Quarag or whatever they're they're called. Um but they still have to go to the Etihard. That's not easy. By the way, did you see Gordon scored four goals in that? >> He's good, man. >> I did. I did have a chuckle. I saw him have an argument with Trippia. If he was in my team, he would have given Trippia the ball. I know it. I just I was sitting there thinking, you honestly, you're just a he become a real troll. But I was happy for him. Good for him because he's had a he's had a strange season. One minute two seasons ago, he was 100 million pound player being touted for Liverpool. Then all of a sudden, he's sharing minutes of Barnes. Well, not quite sure what's going on there. But he's a troll this season, Price. So, I'm not I'm not I'm not going to consider him no chance. >> He is. He is. >> But, um, so you you you're thinking this is a bit crazy judging by your not crazy, but a bit more risky. >> Uh, the Palmer move. >> No, sorry, the the captaincy. Just the just the I think Bruno the the role that he's playing now, there's not a single week that he's it's crazy unless he's playing Arsenal or something. So you can take on Harland with Bruno any week now. That's how good I think his potential is in any week. All set pieces, penalties, and Man United are good in attack. They're the second best attack in the league at the moment >> or over the season even. >> So it's a it's it's not a bad shout. I just think home to Newcastle versus away to Everton, I back home to Newcastle with no midweek games for City. That's all. Next week I'll I'll join you. >> Okay. Yeah, that's probably and I think it's it just it's linked to that I'm I'm playing catch-up. It's nearly last 10 game weeks for me, Praz. I've seen what you've done in three weeks, so maybe I don't need to go fully, you know, gunhole at the moment. Maybe I'll still play a bit more, but I am it's it's linked to that. That's the truth of it that I'm going to try my luck in a couple of moves and see if I get lucky. >> Honestly, your team looks fantastic. It's very well set up for gameweek 31, the blank gamewe. Uh you've got upside with O'Reilly, you've got upside with EkitK, who not many people own. You could potentially own WZ and a Boneworth midfielder or a Brenford midfielder next week. >> There's good upside. This team looks good. So you don't >> even Wilson's fixtures >> even Wilson's fixtures become decent. Long as these minutes stay okay press, even his fixtures change. So I was thinking the same thing. It's only because a bit of the optimism has been beaten out of me, but I'd agree. I was thinking the same thing. So maybe I will uh have a sleep on the captaincy, but at the moment it is on Bruno Fernandez. I looked at Man United's numbers. You you you've been very good and he's just a top class player. That's it. Okay, I think that's enough on my team. I think let's u let's look at your team. But before we go to your team, PZ, a quick word from our sponsor. >> Since becoming a mom myself, I take Mother's Day shopping for my own mom and mother-in-law a lot more seriously. Don't get me wrong, a bunch of flowers from my children is always wonderful, but an aura frame is the upgrade moms deserve. Flowers last a week before they have to be thrown away. Chocolates are eaten the same night. But an aura frame proudly displays those precious moments between mothers and their children. First cuddles, birthdays, graduations, wedding days, even cuddles with those newborn grandchildren. My mom is the first person I call for help or just for a chat. and I hope that that will be the same one day for my children as they grow older. So, it's the least I can do to show her how truly loved she is this Mother's Day. Aura frames have unlimited storage, so she can display as many happy memories as she wants rather than having to pick just one printed image. I can preload the frame in advance with photos and videos of adventures, holidays, days out, important family events, so as soon as she plugs it in, she's greeted by an influx of memories. And when we're apart, I can add new photos direct to her frame from the app, so she sees the allimportant milestones in my children's lives, even when she can't be there.

Terms and conditions apply. >> Right. Pres take us through your team, please. >> Team is Rya in goal, Gabrielle Van Djk, Alder. I'll talk about the the benching dilemma with Alder versus Anderson versus Hill, but that's what I have at the moment. In midfield, I've got Ibumo and Bruno. a couple of two Monday night action players which will be nice. Uh and then Rice and Enzo. So not too dissimilar to you and I have got Ekkit Holland. Holland is firmly captain and Strand Larson. So the first thing that is on my mind is should I do Strand Larson up to Thiago? Now I know Stran Larson is playing Bulls at home but then Thiago is also playing Brighton at home >> and Brighton is a kind of game where I think it just suits them like in terms of you know a higher line Thiago will have space to run into. Dango will enjoy himself and then the other side of the coin is Strand Larson and Crystal Palace look really poor like they are not in a good space at the moment and so I made my points right. I could have gone straight to Thiago last week, but Thiago was playing the best defense in the league in Arsenal. Strands was playing the worst defense in the league in Burnley. I made my 11 points. >> Stanley got 13 and Thiago got two. Now, I got lucky Thiago could have scored more in that game against Arsenal. >> Yeah. Yeah, he could have. Yep. >> So, at this point, I'm thinking it's 100% a move I'm going to make next week, right? Strand Larson to Thiago. In fact, the 0.8 is exact money where I can go Stan Larson to Thiago. So the thing is I'm thinking I might just do it this week. So that's the thinking which sounds very odd that how can you sell a player who's playing Wolves at home. Well, you can when it's Crystal Palace and they're, you know, the manager is sort of in under pressure. The team is not playing well. Lacro got injured today. They're already without Mateta. They've lost Ez. They've lost like all the players that they've lost this season as well. Gay. So I just don't get good vibes. Whereas from Brenford, you get amazing vibes. like they were unlucky not to like even win the game against Arsenal. So that's that's where I am in terms of uh my perspective that I could do Strand Lassson to Thiago. But I'm going to wait like I mentioned till Saturday afternoon because it's a later deadline and then I'll see what's up with Holland because if Holland is out then Holland to Thiago also works because Tran Lararsson does have a good fixture this week. >> Yeah. >> And and then next week Enzo can become Salah. So if that happens in the Holland out case. >> Okay. >> So >> yeah, >> that's one where Stan Larson to Thiago is the likely move. Exact money for no problems. I think the the pricing is is okay. Thiago is not going up anytime soon. The second decision for me is Aldder versus Anderson versus Hill. >> So I don't know. >> All are good. The clean also Anderson and Alderator are exactly the same. Both are around 31%. The defcon potential for Anderson is higher in any game compared to Alder or or I mean Hill is these days doing very well as well but Anderson just gets a lot of defcon even if he in games he'll miss out he'll be on eight or nine right so you're almost there with Anderson so if it's the same clean sheet odds then the temptation is just play Anderson right because Alder had some injury issues over the the FA Cup weekend he sometimes gets an earlier sub which affects your defcon potential imagine if you're on nine and you get subbed off on the 81st minute So, I am contemplating starting Anderson over Alderete, although I do buy into the whole Sunderland home form. So, it's a 50/50. I'll see where I'm at. I won't be playing Hill, even though he's done very well for me. I just think West Hammer on the up. They're looking much better, especially in attack. And Bournemouth defense is looking very poor. So, I'm happy to have Hill for >> I'm surprised at that price because he's been unbelievable for you recently. And even with their defense, like I said, being a bit shaky. He's clicking up devcons. He's getting assists. He's like, >> you don't think you just ride that wave p you don't ride that wave. >> You know, it's the it's the time to buy ISAs. You know what your investment advisor says before you buy an ISA? He says past performance is not an indicator of future returns. They always say this. >> They have to say that. Yeah. >> So that's the same thing with Hill. Him getting assists every game is not going to happen every week. Yes, he can get Defcon, but if there's a material difference in clean sheet odds between Fulham and Sunderland versus Bournemouth, I'm going to play the guys who have Defcon potential and better clean sheet odds. Right. >> Okay. >> So, for me, it's really between Anderson and >> so you're a ruthless manager. That's what you're saying, PR. A ruthless. There's no sentiment around you. Bills delivered last three weeks. Incredible bench. Not even first bench. Second bench. third bench because I'm going to bring pots into my 11. >> Oh yeah, you bring it. What do you mean? Pots >> pots is suspended and my first sub. Do you not know this that my first sub I >> don't don't do that. You're not going to do that, are you? >> I will do that. >> The bench bench shenanigans. Yeah. No, >> you know who I'll bench? I'm going to benchmo. I knew it. That's what I would do as well. >> Yeah, because Imbumo is on Monday night. So it's not like I'll have to look at bench points throughout. He'll just play on Monday and then sub on immediately. >> Yeah, that's that's I see it sometimes in my mini league and you're like more points than him and then I see he's got 12 points on the bench. Oh god. >> Last year legit I I I don't like to do it but sometimes I I do it as a superstition. Last season I was every time I was getting Rogers points on the bench. Every time. Every time. Then I did this thing. I don't know if you remember where I was like, I'm going to play him on the bench and play do this ports kind of thing. The guy got double returns and I was like, man, this works. So, I'm going to do it again and we'll see. >> Oh man, that means Bumo's going to haul. Oh my, I don't think I can handle this. This is the problem with this now. It's going to mess me up cuz a lot of my mini league rivals have got him. But, um, your team press is in good place. Like you said, I like your move. You're similar to me. You got the right money for Thiago. To be fair, that move makes sense because Wolves are not bad either. You know, they've improved a little. I mean, don't get me wrong, I know, you know, when I say that they've improved a little, I should say, recently. >> It can definitely backfire. No one is surprised if Stan Larson scores a goal, gets three three bonus, and Thiago blanks, right? No one is surprised. >> But in the context of that, I am 100% going to do the move next week anyway because Stan Larson is blanking in game 31. I have no interest in him beyond these two fixtures that I had in mind. So, I got my points. I'll say thank you to Strand Larson and I'll move on. >> That's fine. And your team, I'm trying to look at your team thinking, is there any other potential moves? No. I quite like the structure of your team. You're already in a 343. You're you're set nicely actually. Captaincy, before we finish off, and I've got a couple questions as well actually for you. Captaincy, you're more set. Praise. This is the combination you're going in for this week. Unless you hear Harland's 50/50 or something silly like that. >> Yeah. Then Bruno cap. Okay. And if if if Harland's not your uh captain or vice captain, who is who would you pick next in this team to be vice captain? Who would be next? Who's the next best option? >> Um >> I'm trying to see you ever say I was going to say that. Would >> Yeah, I was going to say good, man. >> Enzo's playing in the number 10 against Burnley. If the all the rage wasn't Palmer, people would be talking about Enzo a lot more. But >> penalties, three penalties in two games, press. I mean, what is the odds of that? And you know what? That's that's that's crazy. That is. Yeah. Yeah. No, I like your team. You're in you're you're you're in a good place. I reckon you're ready for another good week. >> No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't don't don't say that. You always jinx my team by saying that. It's a rubbish team. Imagine starting bots. That's how bad it is. >> I'm sure I said it last week and you had an >> You didn't. And I stopped you last week as well. >> Did you? All right, let me not say that then. Your team's rubbish. >> Exactly. >> Terrible team. Red Arrow. There you go, mate. >> Deservedly 800k. >> That's set you up nicely. >> Now, before we finish off, PR, there's a couple more questions I've got for you. I'm just going to quick quickly flick through them because we we've done we've done more than enough. What if Harland's injured? You've already covered that, so we're not going to go into that. Is it too late for Semeno? These are some of the questions I get from online on on X. Is is the Semen's been flying. I've been saying it to you for weeks, Praz. I I've never been able to get to him, unfortunately. Is it is is it too late for Simeno to bring him in for this for these for the last four fixes before the blank? No. >> No, it's not too late. Like um you're going to have three people you can bench right in gimmick 31. So if your team is in a place where you can bench Gabrielle Harland and Simemeno, go for it. If you're in a place where you don't care and you want to put out 10, but you want to get Simemeno anyway, go for it. But I would just say one thing. Semen is 7 50 60% owned now. So what is your objective of getting Smen? Are you like ranked 50th and you want to cover him? Get him. Um are you chasing? And in that case if you are chasing then I would say maybe try going against him for a lower own player maybe works maybe in Bumo maybe Rogers. So you could lose that but I'm just saying think about that a little bit in terms of what is your objective. Unless you think Simemen outscores all these guys that I've just named by 20 30 points, then yeah, buy Simeny, man. He's great. >> He is. Yeah, he's been he's been outstanding this season and he's slotted straight into Man City. O'Reilly, we've already discussed that. I think me and you both agree he's okay for now. Don't touch him. Arsenal, is it time to sell this double defense press? >> Like for example, >> no, you don't think so. Press, do you? Go on. Sorry, mate. Go on. No, but every week they are top three in clean sheet odds and I believe in clean sheet odds. People are not idiots. It's a good defense. They've been little unlucky conceding the goals. And like in my case, I'm going to hold Rya and Gabrielle through the blank because I just think they're good picks. Like they play Everton at home just before the blank. That's a banker clean sheet fixture. So there's no need to do it. But for people with timber and Gabrielle, I can understand if you're looking to move timber on because you can't really carry Timber Gabrielle and Holland. It's hard. So moving Timber to somebody like a Hill to create funds or to somebody like a Van Djk to capture this good fixtures that uh Liverpool have that I I can understand. >> If you had four transfers PZ, would you even ever contemplate a move like Rya to Keller to free up money and prepare yourself for >> would you if you had the luxury of the transfers? Yeah, >> why not? >> Okay. >> Yeah, I was thinking that as well. Especially if you've got that one or if you've got the luxury of transfers and you've already got Gabrielle. just say and uh Rice in midfield. So these are kind of quickfire sort of questions. Rice in midfield is he could we sell him. The fixtures are pretty difficult the next four next up until the the blank. Okay. Uh although he's been consistent he's returned the last three games whether it's assist or defcons. He plays the minutes and Arsenal are still at the end of the day title favorites. Is it do you think we should consider freeing up that spot selling him someone else? you. Yes, you can. But he's one of those players a bit like Anderson plus where he's You he saw in the double, right? He got no goals. What did he get? 14 pound pointer, 13 pointer. >> Y >> that's what Rice gives you that over five games. You don't have to worry about him. He'll get you a couple of assists. He'll get you two, three games with Defcon. And at the end of it, you know, this late riser tweet of, oh, in five games, you'll see that Rice will have good points whether it's as many as Semeno or less than Semeno or as many as Rogers, but he'll be up there. And so he's never a problem. Some people can sell rice this week, some people can do it next week, some people can do it just before game big 31. All of them are fine. >> Cool. No problem. So he's not basically an urgent issue but if you can maybe go right to say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say say whether it's Palmer or vert whatever it is or say maybe then nothing wrong with that as well >> last one last one on Arsenal there's a couple more questions as you can see I'm going through the team couple of teams sucker who's one of your favorite FP assets now in a number 10 does this all of a sudden interest you or or too early >> I think anyway I think this experiment will be finished they have now drawn two games on the bounce wait they drew They did. >> They did. They did. Yeah, they drew both. >> No, they drew Wolves, but they drew Brenford as well. >> Yeah, they did. Yeah, >> they drew both. They drew both. So, they've drawn these games, including losing to Manchester United. They're going to go back to type. They're going to bring Odegaard back. I feel if he's if he's back from injury, Saka's going to go to the right. The whole thing I I don't think it worked as well. Of course, it's good for Saka if he's closer to goal. >> Yeah. >> But also, not really, right? I mean, he didn't get those cut back shots that we're used to seeing him get. So look, I I don't have much to say, but yeah, he got defcon and he got a goal. So Saka's always good, but I don't see people going there now because of the double. Sorry, the blank that is coming up. >> The blank. Yeah. No, I thought I'd ask you about him, so I know you're a big fan. I'm going to flick through quickly. So Liverpool, you go super frustrating press, one return in the last five, but is he someone that if you don't own you should be looking to bring in because of these upcoming fixtures? I think structure dependent like some people will go for just words some people may just go for sosai some people may go for a kitk depends on your structure I'm quite bullish like today there was news that Isak will only be back by the international break which means game week 31 or 32 which means he has a clear run and similar to Man City Liverpool had no game this midweek they have no game coming up so you can expect good minutes for forkit as well so I'm quite bullish He gets big chances. He's mixed two chance two big chances in the last two games where he was this close to scoring. But look, if you look at underlying data, it's good. His minutes are only improving. So, I'm happy to own him, but I don't think he's essential. You can get you should get a Liverpool attacker if you can. It could be worse. It could be him. It could be Salah. It could be Sabosai. All good. >> I was going to ask you about the midfielders, but you've already touched on them, so I won't go to that. Van Djk, is he the best uh premium defensive asset available now to bring in if you're getting rid of say a Timbar or would you look to him? Would he be the first Chelsea? Yeah, >> because look, Chelsea's fixtures are now bad. Palace will blank and they're looking poor. Timber, we've talked about you can keep him. You don't have to move him on, but at some point he's blanking as well. So, they're not many left, right? So, you can always come down, of course, if you don't like Van Djk. But all I'll say is their underlying data has been very good. There's been so many games where they've just conceded the odd goal and people go I'm so frustrated with Van Djk. Well, it happens with Arsenal as well. Good defenses over a longer period will keep clean sheets. It they will come. So, I still think it's a good defense. He's got route to points with his defcons are returning. He's got the odd goal in him. Why not? Like he's he's got good upside. >> Fine. That's done with Liverpool. Quick ones on Villa. Sorry about this, Bri, but these are a couple more questions that we had. >> Yeah, I just thought, you know, just quickly squeeze them in, you know. So, Aston Villa's fixtures become really, really good. Okay. Well, we know that apart from Rogers, is there anyone else to consider cuz people will be looking at Villa? Like, is there any other player that interests you? It's a tricky one. This >> Douglas Luis, is he starting every game now? >> I'm not even monitoring the guy. Like, he's 4.9. Yeah, he's played 90 76 83. So, he's getting taken off. Not great for Defcon, but he's somebody most likely is going to be on penalties. I think with Buendia, he's got good potential. Issue is always minutes. >> Cash, the defender, maybe >> cash is also all right, but defenders without Defcon and not amazing clean sheet odds. You see how people are getting frustrated at Timber, right? They're like, \"Guy, come on, man. Where's my defcon?\" Like, Anderson is cleaning up Defcon every week. Like, I need it. Clean sheets are just not enough and the moment you lose your clean sheet you're like what the hell are you doing in my team? That's the problem I have with cash as well where if you're doing it for one week in that week that is game week 31 where who are they playing? I think home to Burnley then okay get him but if you're getting him for a longer period you're going to get frustrated very quickly. >> That's where Defcon has changed the this the the field basically like you said normally we're bit more fullbacks every if they return every 3 weeks is good but Defcon they're returning every week some of them. some of them and then you're looking at your player premium timber if he doesn't get an assist or a clean sheet you're like what's going on 4.4 millions returning so yeah it has changed the game 100%. Okay, >> Villa is home to West Ham in game week 31. Burnley is the Fulham game. So, yeah. Um, >> they've got good fixtures. >> They've got they've got good fix. That's the reason I I mentioned him. I think it was a valid question. >> Well, I remember getting Rogers. He's 29. 30 weren't amazing. Let me have a look. So, 29 they're playing Chelsea and 30 they are playing >> Manchester United I think. And then West's >> and United away. >> It's not it's not incredible, but they're not >> But this week is good. It's a good entry point. this week to get before leads at home and next week is also decent. Who are they playing? Away to Wolves. Yeah, exactly. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, it's a bit of a derby. >> Exactly. >> Okay. Couple more. So, we already touched on Palm. I forget that. Enzo Pedro after next week Pra they can be sold both of them. >> Y >> yeah. >> Can we not have to be >> not have to? Of course. Of course. And uh the last one was on Brenford. A couple of questions. We've already touched on Thiago, so we won't go there. We know he's probably going to be the hot hot pick. >> How about the midfielders? Who would be next? I think you I think you might have answered this as well. Shard, is that right? Praise would be next if you were going to double up there. >> I I think Tango is also good. >> So I I my general view on these is wait a week uh and then take a call because Shard hasn't played since Tango came back because Shard has been suspended. So we haven't actually seen Brenford with the three of them. Of course, we did see them earlier in the season, >> but I just want to see it once more in terms of how they're setting up so that then you can make an informed call. Otherwise, Dango is the cheaper of the two anyway. So, there's no harm just going for Dango directly. Um, and again, I think if you're asking about Bournemouth Mids, everybody's back now. Um, Brooks is back, Tavanir is back. Uh, so even going for the the Ryans or the Adleys of this world, you're just not sure with minutes, right? I mean, everyone has to play some minutes. So, I'm a little bit skeptical going this week for any of them. If you have Enzo, just wait, man, and just do it next week. >> Totally agree. And thank you very much, PR. That was all the questions um I had stacked waiting for you. So, thank you for that. >> This is why we don't do early thoughts, we do final thoughts. So, there's a final answers. >> You're not going to let that go, are you? >> Oh, Sam's going to watch this. She's going to be like, \"Nah, she's going to be on to you.\" PR, expect a text from her. >> If I'm not on the next show, guys, you know what? Where it all went wrong. I criticized the Enterprise >> cuz you know last week the timing you wasn't there. People were worried. If you saw the comments cuz the Tottenham manager was fired, the not forest manager was fired and then you weren't on the show. People were like, \"Uhoh.\" >> Uhoh. That's three. Uh >> oh. Has Pr Yeah. has Pra got his uh P45? But we we know we told him you'll be back and and you did. >> Cool. Praise. Thank you very much for that. That was very enjoyable. Let you go and enjoy your your evening. And um >> I'm going to wish you bad luck so you can get a green arrow. >> Terrible. >> And uh yeah, hideous team. Let me say it about my team, but it probably will be bad anyway, so don't bother. It doesn't work for me. It doesn't work. >> Your team looks great, Mo. >> Oh my. You see what you've got a dud here. >> You've got Wilson first sub. Imagine Imagine. What a flex. I've got pots in my 11. >> Yeah, I'm gonna I'm going to take it as I'm not going to end the show on a a negative. So, I'm going to take it as a positive. Thank you for that. All right. Take it easy, guys. We will see you next week. Okay. Take it easy, everyone. Bye-bye. >> Take care. Bye."

      "transcript": "I know. Hey, hey, hey. Good afternoon everybody. Welcome to the fantasy football Q&A ahead of gameweek 27. We are joined by we I am joined by a fellow troll captainer on Gabrielle. I'm sure many people listening to this would have done the same. If you went elsewhere, if you went for Rice, I reckon you would be quite happy. If you followed FPL General's strategy and ignored the triple capsy alto together and bench boosted, you were probably quite happy with players like Hill doing well. And to be honest, if you didn't use a chip, I reckon you're pretty happy with how things turned out. Sam, we use a chip. We're both triple captains. What's your thoughts? Yep. Do you know I the ridiculous thing about all of this is that I I think I sat here on last week's Q&A and was like I haven't even thought about it. I'm definitely not doing it. I'm not interested in doing it. I don't want to do it. And then I got to Tuesday afternoon and I read there was an absolutely incredible article on Scout by FL Scoop Alex. It was phenomenal. And I read it and I was like >> then I went over to the scout the official site and I was pondering around like making transfers and I just thought oh I have to see what the scout's saying. And then I read the scout article over there as well and was like, \"Oh.\" And then I was looking at the Q&A uh obviously write the pod script. So the for the that morning I'd made the FL pod and I'd looked at the numbers of triple captains active and it wasn't that high and or I looked at it again. I was like, \"Oh, it's gone up quite a lot.\" And then I was like, \"Oh gosh, it's going up a lot.\" And I don't know, in the end, I just I think I just FOMOed myself into it more than anything. Like I didn't really even want to play it. Like I wasn't I wasn't convinced they keep clean sheet against Brenford. So when that went I was like well you know wasn't expecting it anyway. This is what it is. But I was expecting one against Wolves. So last night we went um we took the kids to the theater and it was lovely. Had a lovely evening out. Didn't think about FPL really. Halime break. We have a look at the score. Arsel winning. Okay fine. Rice has got an assist. Okay is all right. Heading in the right direction. thought, well, I'll just get on with my night. Then get to the end of the show and, you know, finishes the stage lights, house lights come up and I think, I just check what's going on in my uh UCL fantasy team and my FPL team. >> UCL, that's good. That that went very well. >> Gordon, four goals, I'm guessing. >> Yeah. Yeah, Gordon, four goals. Had Chiao as well, so that was good. And I had I had loads of points actually yesterday. It was very good. Uh then I looked at the Arsenal game which I didn't look at first because in my head it was the clean sheet was going to just be there because Wolves have had an XG of like what 0.2 or something in the first half like nothing and then to see it had finished 2-2 I was like oh good grief at least he got an assist so we take some small mercies. >> It's very meh >> it's disappointing isn't it? I mean obviously if you went for Rice, you went for the the differential this week, you really cashed in on it. Um I mean, seven points for captain generally is pretty crap. Let's be honest. I mean, it's >> we've had worse. I've had worse. >> We've had blanks, we've had we've had injuries, Manet onep pointers, you know, it it has it can obviously be worse. And like a good result for the chip is like 15 points. So >> yeah, >> you know, I think if you if you went for Rice and you use a triple caption, you'll be really happy. If you use Gabrielle, you'll be a bit disappointed, but I don't think it's a season ending. I >> don't really season ended way before this this mess. Yeah. >> Yeah. Although I am only one point now. One point off having a a rank starting with a one >> being in the top two million. I could I could only dream after another another red arrow. Uh interesting. Let us know your thoughts in the chat about um you know what you think about the the triple captaincy. Truly says seven point triple captain in game because it's disaster to be honest. Yeah. I mean he could have got an own goal. I thought he'd scored an own goal when I was watching it and he could have been sent off in the first game. So >> yeah, >> it could actually have been a lot worse >> uh for him. Um so yeah, it was a it was a bit weird. Uh FL polls says Sam the best watching FPL. Thank you very much. Emanuel says, \"My first live FPL Q&A. You judges watch after.\" So nice. Oh, drop us your questions. >> You're welcome. >> Make sure we answer whatever questions you've got, Emanuel. Uh, but yeah, it's a funny it was a funny week. Um, my my all my hopes of a green hour were resting on on last night. And Timber again, I mean, Jurian Timber has just been absolutely awful for me since I I bought him in when Gabrielle got injured. >> And like I just I thought that was such a no-brainer >> transfer. And he just isn't getting the death call. He doesn't had any attacking returns. He >> just It's just really frustrating. >> Really frustrating. >> Are you going to sell straight away? >> I'm very tempted to. It's Spurs next, isn't it? What do you make of the new manager and all of that? Frank gone since the last time we spoke. Yeah. No, no, I'm not sad. I'm not sad. I um I look, honestly, I'm I'm pleased that he's gone. I think it was needed. I think we were at a point where I was starting to think we might go down because he it was just not working. And I whilst I appreciate that it's not all his fault and we've had a lot of injuries and everything else, fundamentally something had to change and you can't sack the whole squad and you can't bring people back from injury quicker than they're ready. So something had to happen and the thing that happened had to happen was him. I'm surprised it didn't happen after the West Ham game a few weeks ago. I do think that they were really trying to hold him. >> Yeah, >> I think they were really trying to keep him till the end of the season. I think that that they decided they wanted to >> they didn't know who to bring in, right? Like it's a it's a bit of an odd appointment, I think. >> Well, it's a man to literally see us through to the end of the season is somebody who has a record of coming in and >> firefighting. I mean, okay. Uh I mean, I >> I think DH Big Sam might have had a very different reaction to what TUDA has had amongst the Spurs fans. I think, you know, at least it's it's an appointment that that leaves the PCH door wide open, which I think has pleased a lot of manager a lot of um Spurs fans. And I think it's a it's we'll see how it goes. The fact that Arsenal in a slump and we go into the weekend with a new manager feeling like we might have a bit of a positive bounce and we could have an impact on them not winning the title and we could save ourselves at the same time. All of that feels for for the first time in ages. I feel not really negative around the situation at Spurs. Like I feel like the change was needed just to reset the mood if anything else. So yeah, I'm I'm pleased. I think >> I think you're in trouble. I think >> I think you're going down. >> I think you're I think one of us is. No, I think Forester Liverpool do us a favor and smash Forest and then we'll both feel much much better. >> Yeah, I I I think for I mean we we've got Brenford away this weekend and then we've got Forest the week after and >> that Brighton Forest game is massive by the way. >> I I don't think we're going to get anything in Brenford. I think they're just too good for us and they're too physical and we're so lightweight and I think they're going to win that game quite comfortably. Forest I God knows it could be we have to win that game. If we if we lose that game and we've lost to Brenford and Forest at one point behind us, >> we're in big >> especially if we somehow manage to get something against Arsenal, which would be quite frankly miracle. But >> yeah, you I mean if you you if you got a draw and leads win and Forest win and we go into that forest game and lose that, we are right down in there. So >> yeah, it's it's very very concerning. Uh FPL Scoped, uh let's start. Oh, actually no, sorry FPL Scoped. We'll come to you in just one second. Uh before we do, we've got a sponsor for the stream uh today and it's one of your favorites, Sam. >> It is. They're back. Um and I and I was just saying to you, wasn't I before we came on, I was like, I'm not going to look at the frame. I'm just going to hold it up and we're going to see um see who see what photos appear. But actually, I can't show that one because it's not. We could do this one. Um because appropriate. >> It had No, no. God, no. They're all appropriate. >> Can I say blow? It was a p it one of the pictures was a side by side and one of them was of my niece and I didn't feel like it was appropriate for me to it's one thing for me to share photos of my children. It's probably another thing entirely to share photos of other people without asking. >> Very fair. >> So, here we go. We've got my children. Uh here we are. Little family holiday and Eevee punching a punch bag in the gym. Uh as have you bought your mom a Mother's Day present yet? >> I have not. And you know what? I'm in the market for one. So, >> I've got just the thing. >> It's so QVC. Do you know I bet you are you one of those one of those guys that sends flowers for Mother's Day? >> Yeah, my mom's quite hard to buy for like notoriously. So So flowers are normally the easiest. >> M she likes as well. >> Oh, I don't think I'd like that. But flowers are lovely, but they die quite quickly and we have to put them in the bin. So after a week they're gone. If you buy me a box of chocolates, as my kids will testify to, it lasts about 3 hours and then they're also gone. Whereas this, as Phil lips, will last forever. >> Lasts a lifetime. >> Lasts ever. And it has all those important memories. I'm gonna take a risk by by swiping and make sure we hope we don't get any pictures of other people's children. But there's loads of like photos. Look, you can see there's me and Eevee when she was tiny. Uh from throughout the years, and you can preload them all with loads of different um Oh, on the weird screen. Here we go. Uh loads of different images from across the years of things and even videos. There's one of Max playing golf that's moving around. And they're brilliant because you can preload them with any photographs that you want. So, if you're giving it as a gift to your mom for Mother's Day, you can preload it with all these photos of like different memories that you have. So, if you've got kids like I have, then the grandchildren first cuddles with them, birthdays, weddings, holidays, whatever you fancy. Preload them with all your favorite photographs. They don't just have to choose one to have in a frame. They can have all of them in a frame. And you can update these on the road. So if you have the Aura app, which I have on my phone, you can connect it with the the frame itself and then send photographs from wherever you are. So when we were in Dubai on holiday last year, I sent my mom's frames and pictures of us away so she could see what the children were doing. They also have absolutely unlimited storage, which is incredible. So as many photographs as you want on here. Um, and like I say, you can put videos in there as well, not just the photographs. Um, so yeah, it's brilliant. And for a limited time, you can save on the perfect gift by visiting or auraframes.co.uk to get £35 off this frame, which is the bestselling carbon mat frame. It was named the top frame by the independent by using the promo code scout. So, scout utura, so it's a urframes.co.uk. Uh, the deal is exclusive to our listeners. And if you order yours now, it will come through in time for Mother's Day at the end of March. And you can support the show by mentioning us with a code scout at checkout. Terms and conditions are play. >> Beautifully done, Sam. Beautifully done. >> Genuinely though, I would if I got one of these for Mother's Day, I would be delighted. They are so lovely. And actually, didn't before we came on. So, you would know. >> I am a mother. There's one of my children uh and my bigger one. Um when I came on here at the beginning of this stream, I said to you, I've forgotten the frame. Why? Because it's plugged in in my living room and it sits on the side. Because I like it that much. like it's not just in a box waiting to be used on these streams. I genuinely think it is brilliant. It's really good. >> Good question for you from JC. Which EPL player has the best aura? I know what you're going to say. >> It's this guy. >> Of course it is. >> Na Mickey Vander Vander. >> I was always going to be that that answer, wasn't it? Do >> you know what I should do? I should have put a picture of I don't think there is a p picture of Mickey on the uh on my frame, but I really should get one. There's a picture of uh Marvin from JLS on the frame. >> I'll see Mand as well just just just to keep you happy. Uh lovely stuff. F Scopes, I'm sorry. I know we start not answering your question then we then we moved on. We'll come back to it now. F scope says, \"Would you start Rice this week over one of O'Reilly versus Newcastle? Chalabah against Burnley or Muki against Fulham.\" O o rice O'Reilly Chalabar Muki. >> Is Mkelli at home? >> He is. >> Or away? >> He is at home. >> Or is he at home? >> He is at home. >> I don't think you can bench a home Sunderland. Can you bench a Chelsea defender against Burnley? >> No, probably not. Can you bench O'Reilly against Newcastle? >> Playing in midfield against Newcastle. Can you bench rice against Spurs? >> Can you just bench boost? >> What you like at defending corners? Can't imagine it's very good. No. >> Absolutely savage. Let me have a look. I'll tell you. Hang on. Let's go. Team stats. Let's have a look. Uh so set pieces. Spurs have conceded. So they have conceded 110 shots from set pieces. That's the fourth most in the league. >> God, that sounds like a lot. >> Yeah. >> 100 chances from set bases. >> Yeah. So it's it's the fourth most the same as Burnley. >> Oh god. >> Um so that's good. From headers rice doesn't really matter actually, but from headers we are also terrible. conceded 65 from headed headed opportunities which from a corner maybe they go in. Um that is the one two three that's the fifth worst in the league. Only West Ham, Burnley, Forest Sunderland have conceded more headed opportunities. >> And Romero is not back, is he? >> No, he's suspended for another three games. >> Well, I mean the bench boost has to be a consideration, doesn't it? If you're thinking of benching like three of those four. All right, let's let's make a you got to pick one. >> Well, I'm going to sell rice this week. >> Are you? >> Okay. I'm not after hearing that about Spurs defending set pieces. >> I want a um I want Floren F back. >> Yeah. You know, I thought you going to sell Rogers. Thought you hated Rogers. Yeah, I do hate Rogers, but I can't. But then everyone thinks I'm I can't tell Rogers Canada. The fixtures are too nice. >> I I would play Rice out of those. Would you? >> Just cuz he's an attacker, right? And the other defenders, he can still get the Defcon gone. I would imagine he will. Threat >> is basically an attacker. No. >> Yeah, true. I t there's barely anything in it. Any of those could do well. I think >> I would really seriously consider bench boosting this. >> Yeah, I think my my order would be Rice Muki O'Reilly Chalaba. >> That's ridiculous, isn't it, that we think benching Chaliba is right. >> I know, but it's >> But I think it's right because I do actually think that Bernie Burnley could easily score. They often do get the odd consolation goal, don't they? >> You can't bench O'Reilly when he's playing in midfield against anyone. I'm >> just going to look at Burnley. >> That's so tough. That's so tough. >> I I genuinely think there's a really good really good chance that Man City clean sheet this weekend though. And O'Reilly has got attacking threat written all over him playing in midfield. So that could easily be a big return. >> God, what would your order be? >> I'd play Mi, I think. >> Yeah, I play O'Reilly. It's either him or O'Reilly would be my first choice, then Rice, then Chala Blast. >> Okay, you're putting O'Reilly Mugelli joint first. >> I'd struggle to pick between the two of them, but given O'Reilly will probably play midfield, I probably risk him. >> Okay, >> even though I think Miko will clean she >> we've gone completely different then. I think that shows how how tough it is. Basically tight though. >> Good luck scoped. Just >> draw a hat. We've got no bloody idea. Uh Tit says, \"High experts.\" Oh, please don't call us that with these ranks on the screen. >> Off the back of that conversation as well. >> Oh god. Do I take out Foster for Thiago and Timber for Van Djk for a minus four or roll and do it next week? Already have Harland Necat thinking about Semeno captain. I mean Foster to I guess I guess they need the money from Timber to Van Djk to do Foster to Thiago. I'll do it. >> The thing with this is that doing it now sets you up for weeks. >> Just do it. >> I don't really I don't really like the timber to Van Dyke for a hit move, but I mean Foster Thiago is a absolutely insane upgrade. >> I'll just do it. >> Yeah, >> just do it. >> Yeah, I'd do it as well. >> It was laughing as being called experts. We didn't call ourselves experts. Tian called us experts and we laughed at it and now we still get stick. >> We can't win. >> Can't bloody win, can you, Sam? Uh, >> we never gave ourselves that title ever. Where did it even come from? >> I know. >> I know. So harsh. Uh, I'm on the F show tour as well. I'm sure they'll probably but they show they don't show my rank on the FPL show. So that's that's nice. Uh, as a boy FPL, thanks for the super chat. While load people want to keep or get him. I'm looking at selling ET with the helexy caused. Should I sell for Jalo Pedro or do I keep? I'm in a similar position in the sense that I don't really want Ecat. He's a problem. What? But great fixtures on the horizon. Like >> you cannot you you cannot sell EATK. >> Really? You're that bullish on it? >> Yes. Have you seen the fixtures? He's pretty rubbish though as an asset. >> What? >> What do you mean what? He's had he's he's scored two goals once in the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine weeks. >> Okay, hang on. I'm getting the Liverpool. >> His returns are 2213120025. That isn't a great asset. >> No, but the fixes haven't been great and now they are. They're brilliant fixtures for Liverpool coming up between now and the end of the season. They are finally getting there. Like I think over the last couple of weeks, we've watched the Liverpool side that are finally starting to click. Like Vertz is starting to play well. Salah borderline look quite good again lot in the FA Cup at the weekend. Um, I think they're starting to Kirz is starting to lowkey look like this player that they signed from Bournemouth last year rather than just some random and they picked off the street which is how it felt at the beginning of the season. They're just starting to look more like Liverpool again in my view and it's coming at the perfect time. >> Said that though before then they've >> I just I don't know like I look at it. He's got he's got the most attacking returns across the Liverpool team. He's got the biggest goal threat across the Liverpool team. He's had the most big chances across the Liverpool team. Um his his shot share is the highest. His big chance share is the highest. His goal share is the high is second highest behind Isack, but he's injured. I don't think you can sell ETK. If anything, I'm thinking about tripling up on Liverpool and getting him in. I think the main thing is this question specifically is do I sell for J Pedro? Well, Jal Pedro's fixtures after Burnley at home, which is the best fixture you can have after that are Arsenal away, Aston Villa away, Newcastle, Everton away, Man City. In the same period, Ekit will play Forest, West Ham, Wolves, Spurs, Brighton, Fulham at home. I there's I can't see any way in which Pedro outscores Pedro over the long term. No, he might this week, but I don't think I don't think it'll be It's one of those though, isn't it? Where Jar Pedro against Burnley could do just as well as Ech against Nottingham Forest. >> Jedo probably outscores him this week. But moving forward, I think you're going to want to reverse that transfer because I think if you look at this over a fiveweek period, EkitK will outscore J Pedro. >> I mean, Ze says Chelsea are so game so four game weeks ago. I mean, that's sort of how I feel. I mean, you know, I'm I'm looking at teams with Palmer in and with Chalabar and Pedro and thinking they're going to really hurt this week. Like I I can, you know, they could easily score four or five goals against Burnley and we're absolutely >> in the mud. But after that, you're then going to be stuck with three Chelsea players for an absolutely horrendous run of fixtures. So, >> would I be buying Chel I I just don't know about buying Chelsea players now? I think you've you're trying to buy last week's points, aren't you? >> Yes. Yeah. And I think if I was going to buy a cheaper forward right now, I'd buy Thiago over Jal Pedro because of the fixtures that like I I think I do feel like it's a bit points chasey to go to J Pedro. Now it does make sense because it's Burnley and if it was Burnley followed by, you know, somebody else half decent then fair, you know, half terrible, then fair enough. But it's not. It's but it's when you come out of that Burnley game, they're difficult those fixtures. And I and they're not defenses that are going to be quite so compliant. And they're also not defenses that I would expect to just give away penalties in the way that has been happening in the last couple of weeks. Cuz let's also be real about this. Part of the reason J Pedro's been so good in the last couple of weeks is because he keeps being fouled for the same penalty. That's happened three times. You take that away then the points returns are way less. >> Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Um I mean one person says uh scor goals in home games against Wolves burning leads. Yeah, that's not good. Um, API says as your advice is sound most weak. You don't follow it. That's the problem for you. Yep. Tell me about it. Adrian says, \"If has followed his best advice, it'd be top 10K.\" Yeah, thank you everyone. Um, Savino says, \"Yeah, it's probably true.\" Um, Sabino says, \"Eat minutes risk when Champions League starts.\" I was just looking at the at the table. >> For where? For who? >> Yeah, that's the thing. A a for who? I mean, they could play gago up top, couldn't they? But I I don't think Scott really want to do that. They're sixth in the league. They got Brenford breathing down their necks. They've got to finish in the top five. >> They have to finish. They've >> got to finish in the top five. >> Arguably, they've still got to try and finish in the top four just to make sure. >> Yeah. I mean, I I don't know who they house out of that out of that top five either. Arsenal City, Villa, Manchester United, Chelsea. >> Well, there's no way that there's no way. >> Yeah, because there's no way that Manchester United should be dropping out. >> I know. >> Because they've got nothing else. >> I mean, maybe with Chelsea's run of fixtures now, they're only two points ahead. They'll be looking at this run and thinking they'll drop they'll potentially drop some points in in that. But they I don't think they can afford to bench ech going forward. Do you? >> Well, no. If Isak was fit, then yes, I would agree on the rotation risk, but I just genuinely don't know who they would vent. Like, who are they benching him for? Like, they've given him a bit of a rest and it didn't go that well. So, I don't know. like and the rel the relationship between Vertz and and Ech is is going that's the deciding if Sabosla keeps his form up and the partnership between Vertz and and Ekit carries on growing as it is. I think they'll probably do it. >> But you take one of those well you take one of those links out and I think it all falls apart. >> I think you're probably right. >> Yeah. Uh what you about Rayanne? A few people mentioning him. We spoke a bit about him last week. I think we had this pretty much a very similar question. Rayanne Adley Atara Sharda best mids to own for gameweek 27 to 31. Can't remember what we got conclusion we came to last week. I think we we said Rayan, didn't we? Because of the fixtures. >> I like all of them and I don't think there's any reason. And we also had I think Somerville in the conversation last week as well. >> We did on Somerville. >> Yeah, I still am. I still am. Like FA Cup, you know, like I don't know. Like I think I think I really like Somerville. Uh the these four though, the fixes are great for for both sides. Continue to be nice for Bournemouth. They're good for Brenford. I think of the two I preferred weirdly because I love Sharda. Shard's one of my favorite players, but I think with the way that Brenford are playing right now, I'd go Dango over Sharder if I was going to go for Brenford. >> I agree. >> Um but I really like the Ray pick. I really like what he's doing. I like his approach to games. I think there's a real opportunity there. Whereas most people going to go Thiago at Brenford and you'll be investing that way, which makes sense. I think at Bournemouth, and I said this last week, like I had I've got Crooppy, I can't guarantee he's going to start every week. Um, but if you have Rayan as well, that kind of allows you to still stay invested in that Bournemouth attack, which is looking really good. So, I I like them. The best one to own. I think I'd have I think I'd have Ryan because I think I think Alara you can probably cover out with Thiago and I'm assuming most people will go for Thiago. If you're not going to go Thiago then maybe I'd have instead. >> The great I mean the great thing about Dango is you know he's going to win some penalties for Thiago and that link up is is really key. Ryan, he looks like someone who can just do it on his own. He's so good at like beating like just beating players. Um, I mean the the fixtures for both teams are so good. I mean Rayan's got West Ham, Sunderland, Brenford, Burnley. Uh, Dango's got a great run as well. Dango has got Brighton, Burnley, Bournemouth Wolves. I mean, they're both they're both pretty unbelievable, aren't they? >> I'd lean towards Rayanne, I think, >> for all the reasons you said, but there's there's not much in it. I think you can go you can go either either way. >> Uh, yeah. JC says, \"Ray is unknown, hard to handle.\" quite like that element of it when a player comes in hits the ground running and team just don't know how to adapt to someone like Kim. >> Yeah, unexpected. >> Unexpected. Exactly. China says Harry Wilson haven't really mentioned him. He's got they they've got a good run as well for them after after this Sunderland game. They play Spurs, West Ham, Forest Burnley. Nice four. Do we think he's better than all of them though? I mean, he's up there, isn't he? He's up there from 28, but I I' I'd still go Ryan, I think. >> I mean, I think he's a good pick. I don't think he's better than I think I'd rather have Dango and or Rayanne over Wilson. >> Yeah, >> I kind of feel like Wilson might have been, you know, when whoever it was said Chelsea four weeks ago. Kind of feel like Harry Wilson feels a bit six weeks ago. >> Yeah, I I can do um Ellie Anderson to uh and I am tempted. I mean, Anderson's been pretty good for me, but new manager, not really sure what's going to go on there. Um >> well, we want it to go badly, don't we? Both of our sides. >> Well, yeah, absolutely. We need it to. Oh my god. Fur just needs to come and just carry on losing like he did at Wolves to start the season. >> Yeah. Uh Runner Bean says he has a question. Where's your question? Renee, I can't even see it. Uh oh. Who to prioritize this week? Timber to Van Djk, Evan Nilson to Thiago, or Rice to Dango Ryan? Okay, I'm in a bit of a ponder on this because I've got four free transfers this week, which is always very nice. In an ideal world, I would do Rise to Verts, Timber to Van Djk, and then Dominic Calbert Leuen to Thiago. Don't have enough money for that. So, in order to do that, I'd have to also then do Sessi to Hill, which I don't also mind, but that would be using Yeah. No, but that's using all four transfers. >> Can't decide if that's mad or not. don't hate it. >> I don't hate it either, but it also feels like a lot of transfers at a time where I'm supposed to be saving transfers because I don't have a wild card and I might need to do something with the doubles that are coming. It would remove two Arsenal assets. So, it does get me pretty much there with the team for 31. So, that's helpful. Maybe it sets my team up quite nicely then that I can start rolling transfers again. I mean, this is a lovely little monologue, Sam. It has absolutely nothing to do with Ron Bean's question. >> My point was is that I'm also struggling with this how to prioritize because in my head, they all feel like a priority. Getting on earlyish on Thiago feels like a priority because he's only going to go I can only see him increasing in price over the next few weeks with the fixtures the way that they are. Timber Van Djk possibly could wait a week, but then you do miss the opportunity to have this fixture against Forest and Forest aren't great. Uh Rice Rice to Rayan could also wait a week. >> I think this is quite an easy one. >> What would you do then? Just do Evan Nelson. >> 100%. I think Thiago >> I would I would definitely do Evan Nelson to Thiago. I don't think Evan Nilson's a good pick anyway. I I don't like him. He played 50 minutes in the last game. He's never really been a great FO asset anyway. That is a massive upgrade. Timber to Van Dijk can wait. Exactly like you said. Liverpool have got an away game. Timber's playing Spurs who've got no players like available. And I don't think Rice is a priority any week. I mean, I can see why people would look to get rid, but I don't think Rice to Dango or Ryan is a particularly great move unless you're using that money to fund something else. So, >> well, unless the money is being used to fund Evan Nelson to Thiago. >> I'm probably captaining Thiago. this week. That's how little faith I have in Brighton. >> Holy moly. >> Against Brenford. >> What? >> They're going They are going to absolutely crush us in midfield. Honestly, you our midfield is so weak. It's so weak. They're going to absolutely dominate us. We've got no presence at all. Our recruitment's been appalling for ages. Thiago is going to cause so many problems for us. Send Thiago to blank then. Well, you know, who knows? If if Thiago blanks and we win, I'll be I'll be happy. But I I can't see any way we keep we keep Thiago out this week. Honestly, of all the games for us to be having after this bad run, this is about the worst game we could have Brenford away. I think I think we lose like 3-0 or something. >> Wow, I am. >> You can't captain against your own team, says no. Shutman. Can I can and will. >> Wow. Okay. >> Honestly, Dango, Sharda, Thiago. It's going to be awful. Absolutely awful. Yeah, Ron Bean's thinking every Thiago. >> I think the other two can wait. That one definitely feels like the biggest and the best. >> Sell Thiago. >> I hate you guys. I hate you guys. Uh, would you bench booth, says Sashan, a bench of dravka, rice, timber, and muki? Wouldn't be far off. Dravka is not really going to get anything. Not against Chelsea. He could get minus, couldn't he? If they score a hatful, but he's probably going to make saves, so that probably counteract it. So let's assume he's going to get three. Miki, let's assume he keeps the clean. She gets six. Nine. It's not far off, is it? >> It's not far off. The if the Brava had like a palace or someone slightly better. >> I do. The one thing I will say, and you're entirely right about what you said about Spurs, but we do score goals, but despite having no players, we always score. I think in we scored in six of the last seven in the PL like so I do I can't see the Arsenal clean sheet sticking. I do think I do think we'll score particularly in the first game for the new manager and the home the crowd is going to be up for it especially after Arsenal's last two results. Like I do think we will score. So then it's just a case of Rice could easily get an attacking return from a set piece as we've just talked about, but Timber was Virgil, I'd bench boost that. >> Yeah, I don't think I'd do it. I' I'd save it for a double game week. That's what Zool says in the chat. I think I agree. But that that bench could hurt. Just just be aware that could hurt. But Spurs score derby game. Rice playing deep. maybe gets a couple of defcons and then you're relying on muki alley. It I don't know. It could it could be a bit better. >> I don't I don't think I I don't think I'd do it. >> Um Danny Huntley says, \"I've used my triple captain. I've used my bench boost. Everyone basically has my team in my mini league and are above me now. God.\" >> Uh should I wild card? >> Don't wild card now. >> I'm not far off. >> I wouldn't do we go again. Right. used it a few weeks ago >> and you >> but now don't you feel like but don't you feel like it's different now because the problem with now unless you've got loads of transfers in the bank >> the problem with now is that you've got I suppose not necessarily because we are still where are we 27 time 28 29 30 when you have still got time to get four in the bank so maybe it is okay to do it now but if you're going to do it I think you have to do it now I don't think you can wait one or two weeks and then do it you've either got to do it right now or do it into 32 in my view. >> You you basically you wild card now and you bring in a load of Brenford players, a load of Liverpool players, um and a load of Bournemouth players like you get Hill, Ryan, Echitique, Vertz and Van Djk, uh you know, and then probably like Diego, Thiago, and then Keller in goal and you you just back you bank those fixtures on them all delivering and they're, you know, good teams and they and they should do. Um I do you know what I'm gonna say something else that you probably gonna hate. >> If I was wild carding >> this week I would be taking out Harland >> for who? >> Well, >> what would your front three look like then? >> You got two options, haven't you? You either go spread of the money all around and you can create an unbelievably good team if you do that. Look at General. Look how much General's been flying up the ranks because he's just got all of these players that are just scoring week on week week after week. Or you go for Salah. and you say, \"I'm looking at these fixtures. I'm going to get the penalty taken from Liverpool. I'm going to back Salah to, you know, hit some form, get back to his best, and you effectively keep a templateish team, but you you you bank you back Salah over over Harland.\" Don't hate that. >> I don't hate that. No, I don't hate it. I don't hate it. What I don't like about it is that it only takes one goal and it starts to hurt. And if he braces, it hurts more. and and I think that's all fine if Salah does the same. So, as long as they tick over doing the same thing, which they should because Liverpool have got better fixtures, then you're you're fine. But it's a risk and it's just what it's a it's whether you are comfy in that risk. >> I mean, at what point in our seasons do we have to take risks because >> Lee now? >> Well, I've been I've been playing patiently. I've been, you know, using triple captain on a player that I thought would do well. I've tried to play the game in a nice sensible way because when I've been down in the mer before, I've done that and it's worked and I've I've got back up to respectable rank. Now we got 12 weeks left, games are ticking on and maybe I'm just thinking, do you know what? If I go for it and I finish like three and a half million, four million, whatever, but at least I'd give myself the chance to push on into the top like 500k. But how much do we care about finishing really low if we're going to just see it out and have a pretty crappy season anyway? >> When does hope get extinguished, Sam? That's my question. That's a very philosophical question. >> Okay. Well, you say that, but in the last since my wild card, which was what, four weeks ago? >> Yeah. >> I've gone up 1.4 four million places. >> But your using your wild card was a risky move because if you asked anyone if you should have used it, they would have said no, wait for the double game weeks, wait until you've got more information, yada yada yada, >> which is what I did and I've stayed exactly where I am and you've now overtaken me. >> So the risky strategy of you getting rid of all those players has paid off for you. So is >> Yeah, I mean my team was shocking. >> That helped. >> So that helped. Um, look, it's risk and reward, right? And I had this argument I've had this argument with my husband so till I'm blue in the face. Like I think there's risks that are worth taking and risks that aren't worth taking. Like for me, I don't and maybe it's because of the type of manager I am. I am not the sort of manager that wants to risk tanking my entire season. Like yes, I'm not happy, but over the last four weeks, I've proved that we I can take a million that I can easily take a million out of my rank. So, if we can over the next four weeks between now and the the blank, if I can continue to chip away a couple hundredk at each deadline, then I'll be pretty much at the top inside the top million. That that's the hope is that by game week 31, we get there, >> which isn't doesn't seem unattainable at the moment. If I can invest in Liverpool and Brenford in the next couple of weeks, cuz I'm already invested in Bournemouth, so that's fine. Um, but I know that for me when I look at that Liverpool te and I said this about Cole Palmer, so decide whether you want to listen to what I'm about to say or not, >> but I still don't think that Salah is a better pick than either Ekit TK or Vertz. Like in my mind, if I was to take out Haron and money wasn't an object, I'm still not convinced I'd pick Salah. >> I think Vertz is the best one. >> I do too. But it risks regardless of price. This is what I mean. If if I was going to do a wild card team and I'll be talking through one on the show tomorrow, um I I wouldn't be going for Salah. I'd be tripping up on Liverpool with Vert Sec and Van Dijk. >> So in which case, why would you take out Harlem? >> Well, you have you you have to take him out if you want to build a team with Vertitique and Van Djk. >> Not really. >> It's very difficult to not do that. Well, unless you don't go for Palmer, but if you're wild carded this week, you're going to go Palmer for Burnley, aren't you? And then you look then you could look to move him down. >> Yeah. But maybe Palmer, you just have Palmer and you don't have Vvers for this week and then next week you go Palmer to verse and then you're loaded again. >> Yeah. Well, true. Yeah. >> Like I I don't think I like that's my point is that I think you can build a team even if you put Palmer in it for this week that looks great without taking Haron out. And so I look at it and go why would you take I wouldn't take Harden out for Salah because I'd rather have Ekitk Vertz and Virgil than I would Salah. I I think I think it's it's quite hard to have a team with Vertz, Eatique, Harland, Bruno Fernandez, Gabrielle, Van Djk. It's harder than you think than you think. You you need you need to make some compromises. You can't have like a Smeno or you know Rogers or these players. You need to be going down to the Rayans or the the Dango like which is fine >> which is fine. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. I mean >> you still keep creepy. >> I mean I look at my team for example. Well, I've got Verogen, Gabrielle, Timber, Munos, Rice, Enzo, Fernandez, Anderson, Thiago, Harland, Ecatik. So, that's no I've got no real way of getting verts like easily. I could do Timber down and then Enzo up. That's something I'm thinking about next week potentially, but it's not it's not that easy. And then there's no Van Dyke in that. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> So, yeah. Oh, I feel Harry's in the chat. Harry and I have >> sorry I was going to say Harry and I have almost like identical teams and I was wondering whether like his brilliance would outweigh my let's call it bad luck. Let's let's just go with that. It hasn't. We both not been doing great over the last like six weeks. >> Have you you put it on Harry? That's what happened. >> Yeah, I basically cursed Harry which is you know of all the people to curse. >> It's a really unkind because FPL Harry is absolutely top bloke and he's just lovely. >> I know. So why of all the people to curse? Why would you do it to Harry? >> Can you sell my players please? Honestly, there was one week I looked at our teams and we had 10 of 11 players the same and I thought, \"Oh my god, this is it. Harry's obviously going to get into the top 10K. This is my resurgence. It's going to happen.\" And then he had like one of his worst weeks I think he said in like ever playing FPL and I was like, \"Yep, >> that's my world.\" >> The AZ effect. >> Welcome to my world, Harry. Yep. Oh, >> oh dear. >> Terrible. Terrible. Uh, let's take a couple more questions before we go. Uh, Dan Huntley says, \"We're thinking hard out, but Salah had Ramadan. Will this affect his performance?\" The same with Dango as well. I think it was Harry who posted about Dango saying he barely started I think during Ramadan last year, but I think there was some tactical potentially some tactical reasons for that. He wasn't totally nailed in that Bournemouth team. I think Evan Nilson was coming back and and some things. So, >> and I totally sure >> think I'm right in saying that Salah was really good in Ramadan last year. >> I I don't I can't ever remember there being an issue with Salah during Ramadan. >> I seem to remember we all thought it might be an issue and then his numbers accelerated cuz we were all going, \"Well, he can't hold it at this level.\" I'll have to look it up, but I'm pretty sure that his his numbers actually got better during that because they used to stop and let him break his fast, didn't they, during the games if they were a night game. >> Yeah. Uh >> yeah, I don't I don't really think about that as an issue to be honest. >> I'm I'm just reading an article now about it and it seems to say he it doesn't have a huge impact. What is interesting is after Ramadan ends, he tends to like hit it really hard. So >> that's quite interesting. He he stays quite consistent and then obviously breaks the fast and then he he does really well. But I don't think it's gonna be a gonna be >> won't be an issue. I don't think no. >> Yep. Uh and we'll take one more and that's from Seino. Who would you bench Chalabar or Hill? Hill has been so good. Bournemouth West Ham away. Chalabar Burnley at home. I actually don't think you can bench someone at home to Burnley. I know we said earlier that you can but that was very specific him earlier. That was against like O'Reilly Rice and Muki, wasn't it? I just think if you in this sort of situation I I think West probably score. >> Yeah, but Hill's probably going to get Defcon and an assist. >> No, he can't keep getting those assists. >> Why not? >> Because he's after what the his first one he passed to Rayan who beat about four players and smashed it into the top corner. He's I'd go Chaloba. You'd you'd really play Hill over Chaloba. >> I don't Well, the problem with Chaloba is that Chal is Chaloba is it's either going to be a clean sheet or nothing. He won't get bonus because Chelsea are going to score a load of goals. So, the go the bonuses will go to the attacking players. Hill there's a I think Hill's got the bigger chance of a clean sheet. >> Really? >> Hill I think. Yeah, I think Hill is more likely to get Defcon cuz West Ham will attack. Burnley have got no chance. They might have one attack and score from it because that's what they do. Um I think that's tighter than you think. I'd be inclined to play Hill. Well, there goes Spino. That's a useful end to the stream, is it? Pick the one you like best you think he's worth. Yeah. Uh, oh, we'll answer if Bill Harry needs our advice clearly from two people ran 2 million. Uh, Anderson or Dooby Hall. He's been asking this all day. I saw him on Twitter. Who should I sell? No, I think the poll came through like 50/50. Um, >> what is it? Play one of them or sell one of them. >> I think it's sell one of them. I think that's I think I think that's what he's he's wanting to do. He's wanting to sell one of them. I mean, Dudesbury Hall, Man United, Newcastle, Burn. I mean, the Burnley game looks good in 29, doesn't it? But other than that, it's pretty rough. for Everton. >> The fixes are pretty rough for both of them though to be fair because Forester got Liverpool, Brighton, Man City, Fulham, Spurs, Villa. That's horrible as well. >> There is a bit of an unknown with with Anderson, but you've got to think his role is not going to change that much. >> Well, depends. What do you think Pereira is going to do with him? >> Because try and do what bloody your mate did, an >> Well, that's the that's the thing, right? They they wanted an attacking manager, so they hired an well. >> No. So they went back to what they knew and did all right and then they got rid of him and they've gone back to an attacking manager again, >> which won't go well. >> No. >> So what do we think is going to happen with Anderson? I suspect Anderson will actually have to play the same role. If anything, he'll probably have to do more defcon work because everyone else is going to be attacking. >> I' I think I'd keep Anderson. I think I'd just keep him. I I I just think he's I agree with everything you're saying. I just think he takes some set pieces like Dooby Hall over this run. When are you going to want to play at least with Anderson, you can play him in any fixture and know he's probably going to get the defcon points. When are you going to play Dooby Hall? When you got Man United, Newcastle, Arsenal, Chelsea, Brenford away, Liverpool in the next seven. >> Yeah, but okay. But it depends on how long you Harry wants to hold them for, doesn't it? Because realistically you could hold you could sell Anderson you could I mean Holly will hate that by the way as well Harry um you could keep K um Juice Beh Hall until and by the way remember I hate Juice Bhol we've had remember I had moments with him earlier on in the season but that Burnley fixture in 29 >> is attractive. >> Oh Harry you know what let's let's move on. Harry's giving it all all this in the chat. Oh, cool selling Anderson thanks as I took the time to answer your question in a serious way. And this is the thanks I get, Harry. Just because just because I've cursed your team and your season does not mean you can take it out on me on my own stream. That is >> bang out of order. Uh but yeah, >> should we should we turn up to the watch list and and start giving start questioning them next Wednesday? >> We're going to it's exactly that's exactly what we're going to do. Uh lovely stuff. Right. Well, pleasure as always, Sam. Uh, has this helped me? No. Has it helped others? >> What's going to So, hang on. Can we just clarify? You're going to captain Thiago? >> Yes. >> And what are you going to do with your team? >> Uh, well, >> are you going to wild card? >> No, I don't know. I could do if Harland's out. Yes, definitely. I'm guessing he's not going to be out, though. So, >> he's in training pitches. He's not going to be out. >> Yeah, I know. He's probably No, probably not. I'm I'm probably going to I either do Anderson to Rayan, Timber to Van Djk, or Veren to Keller. >> You can't Right. Hang on a minute. You can't tell Harry to keep Anderson and then say you might sell him >> over Dooby Hall. Not not, you know, sell him in general. It's It's Anderson or Doomsbury Hall. They're both, >> you know. And I said keep Anderson. >> No, I mean you're saying to sell him. Yeah. >> Yeah. Uh, Verugen to Kellaher just that feels the most boring one but also the biggest upgrade because I have no interest in Verugen at all and I think Brenford are going to keep some clean she's over the next next few games >> starting with this weekend starting with this weekend. So >> I'll probably do that >> and then do and then do Timber Van Dyke next week >> as I really hope that that works for you and that you come on here next week and you're happy. I feel like we don't we haven't seen Smiley as for a little bit. >> Smiley ass is dead. >> And on that note, >> next week next week, Smiley will be back. >> Yeah, we'll see. >> I right by next week as we will both have ranks in the 1 million. They'll start with ones. >> Well, it's either target it's either Thiago scores five goals and relegates Brighton or Brighton get a surprise victory and Thiago blanks. There's no there's no there's no in between. >> What happens if Thiago scored twice but but Brighton won? >> Oh, that would be great, wouldn't it? >> Yeah, that would be >> that would that would be nice. >> Do I want that? Because I sort of want you getting dragged back down because that means we've got more chance of getting back out. >> I I'm I'm going to be honest with you. I want Spurs to get thrashed. >> So, >> absolute muppet. >> Yeah. >> Right. I don't want happy eyes next week. I want you crying. You've been so nice >> cuz I I tell you what, if Spurs beat Arsenal, I'm going to be intolerable all week next week. I'm just saying. >> Smiley has is dead. Is it It's gone down gone down well in the chat. Lovely stuff, Sam. A pleasure as always. Let's hope Spurs and Brighton both get out of the relegation scrap. Let's hope we both see some Green Arrows as the top two million. But we'll be back. Whatever happens next week, and we see you all there. >> Bye, guys."

      "transcript": "Hello and welcome to another video and podcast from Fantasy Football Scout. My name is Joe and today I'll be looking at the best wild card targets if you are using the chip ahead of gameweek 27. Um, now I'm recording this on a Wednesday. Um, so there may be a risk that some of the players I mentioned may be injured because we still have one more match to go, gameweek 26. But you by the time you watch this, you'll know what the results are and you'll know if there's any uh injury developments there. That's Arsenal against Wolves as well. So do bear that in mind as well. Um and also just reminder, do press that like button does help us out. Do leave us a fivestar review if you're enjoying our content wherever you receive your podcast. Do remember subscribe um where you receive your podcast and also our YouTube channel to get access to our latest content. And do have a look at latest uh offers for membership at macfantyfootscout.co.uk okay to get access to all the latest tools and gadgets to help you climb up your mini leagues. Um any stats I mentioned today, all from that members area as well. And I've also used the FPL plan tool on our app. So um more on that a little bit later as well. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to run through the fixtures. Um, then reveal um my wild card picks if I was wild carding this week, which I'm not, but if I was, um, and then I'm going to go and see how that team does right up until gameweek 32 just to see what you would do there. So, that shows some of the sort of pros and cons of wild carding this time. We'll talk about that as well. Um, I don't know up to gameweek 32. Um because I mean obviously I could keep going until the end of the season, but gameweek 33 there's going to be doubles we believe um and then blanks and gameweek 34. So we don't know what teams are going to be involved in that. We can start to guess to do with the FA Cup results, but we don't know. So it's impossible to put a plan in place together there. So one of the keys of doing a wild card now is try and have some transfers back because you will need them game week 33 if there's lots of doubles there and you don't have those players. But hopefully you will hopefully you will have a lot of players that are involved as well. Um okay, let's have a look at the fixtures. Okay, so these are fixtures from gameweek 27 through to gameweek 32. Um and um so as it as it explains, we're sort of stopping there because we sort of enter into doubles and blanks season after that. There is a blank in game 31 um of Wolves and Arsenal um because they're doubling this week and because they're involved in the League Cup final. Man City as well as game against Crystal Palace is pretty much not going to happen, but there are a variety of permutations um involving progress in cup competitions. I mean, it could actually remain in gameweek 31. So, it's sort of 99% not going to happen. So, it' be a blank for Crystal Palace and Man City, but it might not be as well. So, that will be very handy for those wild carding now, let me assure you. So looking at the fixtures here um game week 27 um through to 32 Liverpool top they got Nottingham Forest then they got this great little run of West Ham, Wolves, Tottenham, Brighton and Fulham. Um so there's lots of potential for clean sheets and attacking returns. So Crystal Palace pretty good fixtures even though they blank and even though they face Manchester United away um they've got Wolves at home, Tottenham away, uh Leads at home and Newcastle at home. So it's an all right bunch of fixtures really. Brenford, really good pictures. They got Brighton at home, great. Bernie away, brilliant. Bournemouth away, great. Wolves at home, brilliant. Leadeds and Everton, it just goes on. Brenford, Brenford are a good team to get for a wild card if you're wild carding now. Um, also to just to target for general and I mean that that what applies. A lot of people watching won't be wild carding now, but this, you know, is of use for transfer targets as well. Um, okay. Uh, Fulham really good fixtures. They got Sunderland away, West Ham at home, Burnley at home in amongst that. I mean they got Liverpool away game 32 but you know all in the whole good fixtures. Aston Villa are pretty good as well. Leads and Wolves nice little run fixtures there. Then they got Chelsea Manchester United but then West Ham Nottingham Forest could be good. Man City fixtures. I mean it's Man City so they should do well anyway but they got Newcastle at home leads Nottingham Forest West Ham um and they do have potentially that blank we well pretty much blank in game 31 then Chelsea away the fix actually toughen a little bit after that but then they could double in 33 highly likely to so you know is that if there two tough games in there at least it's a double uh Bournemouth fixtures on the whole quite good they stiffen a bit towards 31 32 when they have Arsenal Manchester United but they got Sunderland land, Brenford, Burnley, West Ham. Um, meanwhile, Tottenham pretty much a team to avoid at the moment. Um, Nottingham Forest as well, poor fixtures, Everton, Chelsea have got Burnley at home. Brilliant. So, you really want them for game 27. Then the fixtures turn. So, then you don't want them. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Man City, Everton. Uh, Brighton are in poor form and the fixtures are poor as well. They got Brenford away, Nottingham Forest at home. Um, if they lose, oh my god. Well, I mean, I'm a Brighton fan. If they lose Nottingham Forest at home, I cannot see I cannot see the manager surviving. Um, uh, it's different to losing at Arsenal home, which is their next fixture, but losing against Nottingham Forest at home. Uh, Sunderland, Liverpool, and then Burnley they've got. So, okay. Uh, leads fixtures they've got like okay, it's Aston Villa and Man City. That's bad. But then they got Sunderland, Crystal Palace, and Brenford. And West Ham's fixtures are pretty poor as well. So, so too Wolves. Sunderlands are okay. Fulham, Bournemouth, Leadeds, they got Brighton at home, Fulham at home, Tottenham at home, all all from now till 32. So that's [snorts] the pictures there. So um pros of wild carding now. Um one of the pros is is that many teams will look very similar from gameweek 32 onwards. A lot of people wild card them, stock up for gameweek 33 um doubles, which we think will happen, and then use their free hit for the for the for the um the blanks there. you can still if you've got your free hit still going, you can still use that for gameweek 34 if you need to. Um, so it's a chance to differentiate and take advantage of good fixtures now. So, for example, I do weekly video with FPL general. He's gone without Harland all all season. Sometimes that hasn't worked out. Recently, it really has because it's enabled him to get say Palmer invest in Chelsea. Also, he wild carded a few weeks back and bench boosted this week. So, that's not quite that's not a common rationale as well. He's doing exceptionally well. In fact, he's almost catching me up and I've been a Harland team all this time. So, I'm getting worried there. Um, but that is the benefit of being different. Okay, that's a big pro of wild carding now. Cons: total lack of knowledge. You might as well bang a blindfold on and then hope for the best. Um, because those wild carding 32 can arrange a great team for what whoever is doubling in 33. Um, and and you know, plan for for the fixtures to come. you gradually your team as those wild carded whenever you wild carded the first time this season gradually as the weeks go by it starts to look a little bit more tired and we don't have AFCON five for extra transfers I personally wasted mine annoyingly but [laughter] we don't have those as well so the benefit there is to the benefit of of of trying to rectify that that big con um with wild carding now is to keep transfers at hand so when you get to game 33 you're fine you can just use those transfers to try and get whatever double doublers you want that you don't already have as well and you'll know which teams play there but we don't know yet. Um, okay. What I'll do is I'll put the targets up a moment. Just before I do that, um, I just want to say that's from the FPL planner tool on the fantasy football scout app. I've tried to keep it within my budget which is around 102.7 2.8. Um, I must I haven't actually looked at it recently, but it was that about a week or so ago. Um I'm looking for well over 90% rating um with expected points of well above 50. Um so that should do well there according to well on paper. Um and I've also looked to see if that's the case for weeks to come as well. So that's the aim really. Um with this particular team I'm going to put up I had 2 million left as well. So it's within my budget. You may have more you may have less. Um also um with gameweek 31 blanks, if we assuming those four teams do blank indeed City and Crystal Palace join Arsenal Wolves um you don't want too many of them as well. So you need to be keeping aware of that as well. I I've gone into that with four. I don't mind you using a transfer or perhaps even just fielding 10 that week um because I think there's some there's some good teams there. Also, you've got to keep within budget as well. But I'll explain that um the more. So, okay, on with the transfer targets for a wild carding now. Okay, so I'll run through the team and as I do with my transfer targets video, then I'll go back and explain um bit about why I've picked each one of those and then we're going to road test this team right up until game 32. Okay, so we've gone for Keller in goal in game 27 facing Brighton at home. Great. Gabrielle remains from my own team, Tottenham away. Main got Fulham at home and Virgil Van Djk Nottingham Forest away. Um in a 343 I've got Semeno is at home to Newcastle. Uh Dango is at home to Brighton. Brenford's Dango. Palmer would be my captain this week. So Palmer stays in this for those who've perhaps got him already. Palmer. Uh Burnley at home. Um and and and um Bruno Fernandez away to Everton. Uh I've got Strand Larson uh at home to Wolves. Harland who's flagged at the moment so keep an eye on that. He's at home to Newcastle and [snorts] Thiago are home to Brighton. On my bench we've got Dravka, Juicebury Hall, Hill from Bournemouth and Chiao from uh Newcastle. He's got Man City away. So Juice Hall's got Manchester United at home and Hill's got West Ham away. Arguably Hill could go in there um though. So he's a really good um sub. Juicy Hall as well is a very good sub as well for this particular week there. If Harland is out, I'd be minded to go for Salah. Um, so I would do a bit of a rearranging there. Um, so if Harland is out for a long time, if he's out for just a week, keep him on the bench. Um, because you're going to want him going forward if you're wild carding now. But if it looks like he's out for a month or something, which I I don't think I think he's probably just going to play. But if he is, then I would downgrade him and then look to upgrade a midfielder to Salah. That's what what I would do because I I really I feel I want two or three captains. Palmer's one this week for example. Brina Fernandez is a good captain. Semeno is a good captain. Thiago's a good captain. I want another as well. So [clears throat] I want Salah in there. And as I said before, I think Liverpool have a very good run of fixtures as well. So, okay, let's have a look at the the players then. So, gone for Keller. Brenford, as we explained, have really great fixtures. Um, there's a chance he'll add to his six clean sheets. A save every 33 minutes says he can get a save point a match to [clears throat] as well. Um, in my defense, Gabrielle um he stays with um clean sheet potential. Defcon almost every other game. Three goals and two assists so far. So, five attacking returns and 16 shots. so far this campaign I by the time you watch this I he's my triple captain in game 26 so fingers crossed but hopefully I don't get a red card. Um Virgil van Djk is uh finally got his scoring hall last time out. Um strong fixes um for uh Liverpool. Um so wild carders I think can just plug him in and hope he repeats those heroics again. So so far this season found the net twice in the league and he's averaging defcon almost every other game. I think he's got two and three recently. Uh 18 shots um this campaign as well. Not to be sniffed at. So that mega hall he's got before those couple of goals is not for want to trying. So he's had 18 shots. Uh Michael um so many roosters to points for this Sunderland defender. Um he's gone up in price but he's still very cheap. Defcon almost every other match, six assists a goal. He's created 20 chances and 16 shots this season. Great value especially with a strong home form his team. So you go back to those home fixtures. You can you can play him as you can with this one a home to Fulham. Right in my midfield Palmer the captain but only temporarily and more on that when I look at gameweek 28. He's going to be the first one for the chop. Um but but for now he's great captain the easiest home game um easiest game at home to Burnley. He's been great recently with Pedro up front. Pedro wins penalties. Palmer takes them but he's had eight goals and two assists this season. Looks good from open play too. um finally looks to be free of rotation and injury. Fingers crossed there for owners. Um Dangutara for um for more on the merits of him. Um do check out the video and podcast I recorded earlier this week with Tom Freeman. Um so do check that out. Um he is another with many roots to points, five goals and [clears throat] as many assists. He can get Defcon occasionally and has also been involved in almost half goals when he's on the pitch for Brenford. Um which is a great uh goal involvement ratio there. um Smeno there. So suddenly Harland is not the only goal scorer for Man City. Smeno can be selfish and creative which is exactly what you want this season. His new club and Bournemouth he's picked up um he's been involved in 19 goals scoring 13. He's had 59 shots, 29 chances. He's just simply a great pick. Um and can be buried on the bench should he miss game 31 as expected or indeed just transferred out of there. But more of that when we come to that. Um, Bruno Fernandez, a reliable captain many weeks, not every week, but many weeks. Got 12 assists, six goals. He's in a more attacking role now. Um, within with Carrick in charge. Um, got an outstanding 78 chances created and 58 shots. Not bad, eh? Um, so yeah, he's been in my side for a while and I've relied on him for the armband recently and yeah, he's delivered. Um, so he's been great. Uh, forwards. Um, Thiago, brilliant. um my team as well. Um so it was easy to put him in here. He does what he's meant to as a striker, scoring goals. He's got 17, assisted another, and he's had 61 shots. He's great. Put him in. Brenford fixture is brilliant. Uh and he's at home to my team Brighton. So Harland, let's not forget, got 22 goals, six assists, 28 goal involvements, huge. He's just in a league of his own, I think. Um as does his 92 shots this season. Wow. Um so yeah he he stays in but do watch out for uh team news later this week to see if he is um if it is an actual injury or he just sort of missed out in the cup just rested. Um Lson there had a brace in his last run out for his new side that Bose world that he can be the new Mateta at just 6.1. He may have to go in game at 31, but he's very playable this week and against leads soon as well and can play on the bench because you're wild carding now. You got a good bench so you can park him on the bench when they poor fixtures. But what a what a good first sub. Um he is as well. Um as I'll explain a bit later um when we go through the fixtures, if you have a little bit more money, you cannot have Strand Lson and you can have Ecatik. I could do that if I downgraded Mi to say Ronaldo at Sunderland. So gone for the much cheaper perhaps not um as point scoring um uh option and then I could put no need to have Stan Lson just have Ech. So that is possible that could be done. Um so do bear that in mind throughout all of this. Strand Lson could be ech if you have a little bit more money or you're willing to make a downgrade somewhere here. Um okay. Um uh and also yeah on the subs bench draka so he just starts gets save points most weeks won't be needed you might need him for a bench boost um Dbury Hall I still think he's the best eighth attacker across midfield and forward um five goals and four assists great I mean any player below 5 million that's just shy of 100 points from 18 starts because he was injured for a little bit deserves our attention really um Hill arguably could start this week as I've said before he he's just gone I've just gone what they rate my team all at fancy football scouts says that you know he marginally there's better players this week according to this team. Um to be honest um yeah I just think he's great. He's got so many roots to points as well. Assists, defcon bonus points. Not sure about clean sheets for Bournemouth though and that's why he's not in my real life team but perhaps he should be. Um ciao he's got four goals um defcon almost every other match and he's a strong pick for Newcastle which have favor which have some favorable fixtures really. So Newcastle, they do have Everton at home, Manchester United at home, Sunderland at home in amongst the mit. So not all good fixtures, but some are good fixtures. So you don't have to play him every week. We can play him some weeks there. And he's there, there ready to go. And if Newcastle get a double, you got him there in place. Um, [snorts] okay. So let's have a look and see how this does. Um so for gameweek 28 I'll put the team up and the plan is to use one transfer Palmer to Vertz and then one of the blank gamewicks in 31 probably Strand Larsson would have to go um and you can afford uh Ech Strand Lson to Eatique with the money left over or you could just go as I said you can make some downgrades somewhere. I couldn't I couldn't quite do it with my budget so I was just being fair to my budget doing this. um you could just not have Strand Lson and just go straight for Echitique, but I like him this week. I think I prefer him to ech this week and also you can play Strand Lson um uh in against Leads and he's he's not a bad player to have anyway. Um there. So yeah, gameweek 28, this is how it's going to look. Um so gameweek 28. Um still a strong rating. Oh, I'll just I tell you what I will do. I'll just say what the rating was for gameweek um uh 27. So the expected points are 57 which is great according to the rate my team tool there on the planner app and percentage of 93%. So it's 93% excellent. Um 99% is the highest I've ever got when I've do these. So that's still pretty good. Right. Okay. So back to game at 28. Uh this has got 56 points expected points game 28 and a 92% rating. So still pretty good. And as you can see I've moved vert I moved verts in for Palmer and that's left me with 2.4 in the bank. Wow. Flexibilities. you need flexibility and um try and store transfers. So, I don't think I'm going to need to make for two or three weeks any more transfers for this one. Fingers crossed. Um and if I did, I've got a bench as well. So, for this one, you got Keller away to Burnley. You got Gabrielle home to Chelsea. I mean, it's Gabrielle. Virgil van Djk. So, 442 you would play here. Um Virgil Van Djk's got West Ham at home, great. Charles got Everton home great. Hills got Sunderland at home great. So, really good. So, it's a good week for 442. Vert West Ham at home. Dango Burnley away. Brilliant. Um I've actually put the um put the vice captaincy on him that week, but it could be it actually I should be on Thiago really. But um Smeno got leads away as does Harland. Bruno Fernandez is my captain this week going meant to get the roast on the rate my team because he's at home to Crystal Palace. Um but arguably you could put it on Thiago, Dango, Harland, Vertz, Semeno. There's a lot of options here. And on the bench, Juicebury Hall ready to come in away to Newcastle, Mley away to Bournemouth and Strand Lson away to Manchester United. I think any of those I wouldn't mind playing. So if there was an injury here, because a lot of people say, oh, you know, booking in transfers, what about injuries and things like that? There was an injury here. I'm pretty happy with any of these three, especially duh horn, Strand Lson to come in uh on the bench and gameweek 28. So gameweek 28 looking good. Just one transfer. Gameweek 29. Um yeah, so we've got this is expected points 55. Still good with 92% rating. Still good. Um aiming to not use a transfer this week. This [snorts] is a 352 this time around. Strand Larson on the bench his way to Tottenham. Arguably he could play though. Um uh I've also put Hill on the bench at home to Brenford. He could play. Miy away to Leads. He could play as well. So it's still a good bench there. Any injuries here, one of these lads can come in. So I've got Keller in goal. Gabriel away to uh Bournemouth. Uh, sorry. Kella's away to Bournemouth. Gabrielle's away to Brighton. Virgil Van Djk is away to Wolves and Chiao home to Manchester United. These are fine. Um, I've got Vert away to Wolves. Great. Dango. Um, and Thiago, they're both away to Bournemouth. Um, uh, so, uh, Semeno and Harland, they got Nottingham Forest at home and Harland will be my captain. Bruno Fernandez away to Newcastle. Jesus Hall comes in. Argue, arguably he's a cheek. He's a cheeky differential captain this week at home to B. He's takes his turn having Burnley home game. You see why I've got him now there. So that's still strong. So still looking good. Saved transfer gameweek 30. Hopefully still save for transfer. Um once again the bench not as good but still okay. Um Keller he's at home to Wolves. Great. Gabrielle home to Everton great. Virgil van Djk home to Tottenham. Great. Mley comes in. Um he's at home to Brighton. Vert home to Tottenham. Great. Dango and and Thiago in a 35 343. They've got Wolves at home. Smeno and Harland great fixtures as well. And Harland would take the armband um away to West Ham, but arguably you could give it to Thiago at home to Wolves. Arguably you could give it to Bruno Fernandez. And Stran Arson comes in um leads at home. Great fixture. On the bench I've got Hill away to Burnley. Um arguably he could come in. Chow. tougher one away to Chelsea and Juby Hallway to Arsenal. They're a bit tougher there, but arguably Hill can be played here. So, if you get an injury here, Hill can come in um there. Okay, let's go. Keep going. Gameweek 31. Right, this [snorts] is where it dips. So, this is a blank gameweek for Arsenal Wolves and we think and well, pretty much certainly a Crystal Palace and Man City. So, obviously the rating is really low here. I've I've looked at my own team or like made transfers around that and it's still expected points is still only really around 50. You're not expected to be a high-scoring week and rating should be about it's about 85% of my actual team I think. Um but it's 75% here. So I've got three transfers if I was to wild card with this team and I could use one. In fact, I would have to use one if I wanted to get 11 out. Or you could do as I explained earlier, not have Stan Larson at all, pretend he's not there and have Ekit and make a downgrade of Mi because he's 4.6. You could downgrade him to another um Sunderland defender maybe um there. So, okay. So, this one would go into it with Keller um Hill Man home to Manchester United. Keller has got leads away. Verge Mandike awaits Brighton. Great. Uh Miywle and Ciao at home Sunderland correspondingly. Um uh Vertz, he's got that Brighton game. Dango and Thiago away to leads. That's fine. Debury Hall at home to Chelsea. Never know. Maybe he wants to um Yeah, it's hard to believe that he was actually at Chelsea. Maybe he wants to show them a thing or two. But yeah, the rate my team tool quite likes him here. Uh Bruno Fernandez will be my captain away to Bournemouth. Um but Thiago could easily get that as well or well vert. Um and then you got Strand Larsson here. Now you've got 2.4 in the bank. This is when you can use it. Strand Len to Ech or cut out all of this this FAF save the transfer and just get ETK and Strand Lson at the beginning. But I couldn't with my budget here without making some downgrades I didn't want to make. Harland is on the bench. Gabrielle is on the bench. Semeno is on the bench. I would like to them and gave me 32. To be honest, I don't mind stars and gave me 32. So, basically, you're faced with a choice here. And this is one of the the cons of wild carding. Now, you've got to make one. One of these has got to go if you want to field 11. You could move Harland out. You could move Senu out Stan Lson Gabrielle. One of them has got to go and you take your pick. Okay. So, that's why I haven't done that. That's why the rating is so low here because I haven't made that move because I couldn't decide. You could avoid that altogether. Get hope that makes sense. Final one, gaming 32. Right, so this one expected points of 53. That's fine. Uh the rating is 88%. So I'd like to get that above 90%. If you have made for some reason they they hate Strand Lson at home to Newcastle. I like that fixture. I think that should be more for him as well. So I would say that rating should be higher. Expected points should be higher. But if you've moved Strand Larsson to Ekit, you've got him at home to Fulham and then that would bump it up above the 90% there. Okay. Uh you got Keller at home to Everton. Bear in mind a lot of people can be wild carding this week. You got Gabrielle at Bournemouth. You got Virgil van Djk uh home to Fulham. You got Michael for Tottenham. Uh you got Vertz uh home to Fulham. Dango are at home to Everton. Bruno Fernandez home to Le. You see what I mean? This seems to look pretty good actually. Smeno's away to Chelsea. Okay. Thiago at home to Everton. Harland away to Chelsea. And then you got Strand Lson at home to Newcastle. You got Chiao um with Crystal Palace away. Juice Hall with that Brenford away. Arguably he could play and and you got Hill. He's got that Arsenal away game. So you'd probably want to bench him then. Bright Bright Dravka has um uh Brighton at home as well. So that could be quite good. Um so yeah this yeah it's interesting with this team here as I said you could do that move um much much much earlier you know from the outset of gamweek 27 but I like this so with this with no transfers made will be four so if you move Strand Larsson to say a TK you got three transfers for gamewick 32 but going into gamewick 33 you should be up to four you can use those transfers to to nail any double gameers you haven't got then if you got your free hit, you can use that in 34 if you haven't got your free hit. I wouldn't wild card now, [laughter] put it that way, cuz you're going to need that um you're going to need that flexibility a bit later. But if you've already pressed the button now, you every hit, just fingers crossed and hope for the best. But hopefully that's um sort of taken you through the plans for wild carding. Now I must admit when I did it I did I did decide well I think I think I probably made the right choice not to wild card now but I did look at it and those pros and being different now I think are quite interesting. So I think you can come up with quite an interesting team now. I like this team. I've got some players similar and I'm aiming to use transfers to get some of the other ones like say Verts or Dango already got Thiago in place but I think Brenford are really key here. Liverpool quite key um because they've got such a good strong run of fixes. Now Aston Villa here. Um Rogers in my actual team. Aston Villa's fixes are pretty good. Um he's quite handy. Gave me 31 as well. So I think they're quite strong ones to target there. Hope that's been of use. Um if well whatever you decide this week transferwise holding your transfer wild carding even, good luck with that. Uh and good luck with the coming gameweeks. Take care. See you soon."

      "transcript": "I think I'm back. We're back. Um, welcome everyone. Uh, basically I was saying that we're all loving FPL. We're on massive Green Arrows. We're really happy and it's been a real shame that there's not been any football over the past week because we're all absolutely loving getting big Green Arrows every week. And we're all on big green arrows. We all got loads of points this week. Gabrielle was a great triple captain pick. Um, that's basically what I was saying. So, long story short, that's basically where we were. Uh, anything else to add? Uh [laughter] I mean it's pretty miserable, isn't it? But we still got hope tonight. You may be listening to the podcast on a Thursday. Um in which case you will know if if Wolves have scored or if Gabrielle scored. But um yeah, for now it's pretty awful. Last week it was all the panic about playing the chip. I think it's probably I think it's I don't know. It's hard to say it's the right call when it looks so bad on the screen, but like City got a tough FA Cup draw. So, um, the Harland double has decreased in the last week, the chance of that. Um, but yeah, >> we we sat here last week and I actually said that I would take four from Gabrielle against Brenford because a clean sheet against Wolves would give him 10 and that would um, and that would be okay. Like, it's not the best, but it's also fine. So, the fact that he's on three probably should have been sent off. Things could have been even worse than maybe it looks actually >> so should have been sent off. He definitely >> the the only small >> Yeah. The only small positive is he would have been suspended in the cup. So like he still would have played Wolves but he would have been on what zero with the triple captain. So you basically would have triple captain Gabrielle away at Wolves. So uh yeah at least he's not suspended. So let's take the positives. >> I mean when you put it like that and the way I'm looking at it as well is like Van Djk scored a goal, got Kenchi and Defcon. I mean, it's not outside the realm of possibility that Gabrielle has that happen, you know, tonight. So, we'll see. We'll see how it goes. It's not the end of the world just yet. And uh maybe it's a bit of copium, but hopefully he can uh hopefully he can do something. At least just get some defcon or something. >> Yeah. I mean, all of those like graphs that showed if you picked Gabrielle in backto back weeks, the lowest I think he ever would have scored was it nine, Tom? >> It was eight. It was eight. >> It was eight. >> So, he needs he needs a cliche. he needs a clean sheet or we have picked the worst two weeks of Gabrielle that we could have done for the entire season. And if that doesn't sum up FPL, then I'm not entirely sure um entirely sure what else to think. But yeah, it is it is red arrows all round. Tom, we basically all had one different player who got a return to everyone else. So Tom, you had Ja Pedro. Steven you had Andy and I had Burmo and then Anderson Defcon is basically the difference between all our teams. Tom's on uh 39. Declan Rise is set to get an extra one, I think, for bonus. >> Yes, he he'll be getting one bonus point. Some people are saying he hasn't got his defcons. He has got his defcons. >> Yeah. So he goes up to five. >> So Tom's on 40, I'm on 39, and Steven's on 38. It's the same. It's just that like couple of different points in our midfield. It's basically the only returns any of us have got. We all had Crystal Palace defenders. They did really well. You know, home to Burnley. Absolute banker, right? [laughter] >> You think so? >> Daniel Daniels over one XGI. What What could possibly go wrong, >> guys? I mean, I literally transferred out Malik Chow from Munoz. I don't know what if I did nothing. This is the curse of being an FPL manager. You can do nothing and my team would have been in a much better place. But alas, Munoz had to get a one-pointer against Burnley at home. >> This is the week Charles scored, right? >> It's so far that feels ages ago. Yeah, that's brutal. >> It literally does. >> Yeah. >> And I was at the game and I was just sat there thinking, \"Oh my god, what have I done? [laughter] >> What have I done?\" >> Anything else to add on your team, Tom? Uh, I'll do some positives because I bought Jia Pedro for Bowen which was plus five in the end. Um, because Ja Pedro got pushed over once again. So, if Esteev could do that again this weekend, that would be great. Um, and yeah, it was pretty bleak to be fair. Sanchez, you know, two shots on target, conceded. Obviously, no clean sheet because Kaisedo just dives in and then I don't want to talk about the second goal because that was so bad. Um, but yeah, and I'm now down to one playing sub because Pot's got a red card in the FA Cup. So, that's three games out and Doru is obviously nowhere to be seen. So, we're 20 gave me 31. We are um hanging on by a thread currently on about >> No, but is back. >> He's not in the team though. So, yeah. [laughter] Yeah, at least pots is not suspended for 31 if you ended up needing him. >> Yeah. So that's it. 40 points with Arsenal tonight or last night if you're listening on Thursday. >> Steven Elman Pen. >> Yeah, I mean listen, Indai has not had an open play goal contribution I think since like game week 14 or something, but definitely not since he's come back from AFCON. So every game I've watched him, I've been like why did I get and die into my team? But then he goes and scores a penalty. And I remember why we love penalty takers in FPL. A nice cheeky nine-pointer to salvage a somewhat, you know, respectable score on this disaster game week. But you could look at my I think we could look at all of our teams genuinely and say like these are all It's just crazy that no, we got no returns from these players cuz everything, isn't it? >> Yeah. Yeah. This is true. This is true. It's who you don't have that's really killed you this game week. So yeah, I feel like uh a bit hard done by with the Munoz transfer as well because not only did I get Malik Chow out for Munoz, I thought I was going to go a bit safe and go for Van Dyke instead who ended up getting a 17-pointer and I just decided not to go safe and I went for Munoz and that obviously has not worked out. So yeah, I've I've not I've had better days as an FPL manager, let's put it that way. And I I have to I'm really sorry that I'm going to um dig the dagger in a little bit more. How are you feeling about owning Nathan Collins as well? >> Yeah, I mean this is it's actually crazy like I didn't I don't think anyone saw this happening from him going you know being injured to just losing his spot completely in the team. He's not started three games in a row and then like you said to kind of twist the dagger a bit. He then plays in the FA Cup against Macklesfield in what is essentially just a second string team. So he is firmly out of favor and yeah he's uh he's definitely on the chopping block for me unfortunately. I've got to get rid of my Irish captain. >> Yeah, the reason I ask is the reason I mention is because I've looked to buy him. I suppose there is a small train of thought which could say maybe they needed to give him minutes because he's had this injury hasn't he needed stitches and maybe they just wanted to give it an opportunity. So, small chance he starts Brighton, but if he doesn't start Brighton, then I think he feels pretty um dead in the water. >> Absolutely. >> Yeah, it's it's pretty unlucky cuz he he played the two losses to Forest and Chelsea and then he missed the Villa game with the stitches which they won and kept a clean sheet. So, it does seem like he's just rewarding um Vandenberg. >> Yeah. Um yeah, so my team uh yeah, looking pretty similar. I've got Taroski one point auto sub and I've got um the Declan Rice additional point. So the only real differences for me is I had Anderson in my midfield and I had the late Brian and Burmo assist which also came with a bonus point to get him six. The only real positives there. I suppose the other positive is I'm not leaving points on my bench this week like I have done every single week. It feels like so far this year. So at least I didn't make that bad. But the fact that Anderson away at Manchester City has outscored Richards and Tarovski combined um at home to Burnley and at home to Bournemouth is is quite staggering to be honest. So yeah, not much great stuff. I played Juh Hall over Thiago. So when Juh Hall benched and I triple captain Gabrielle, I was pretty certain that Thiago was going to get something also based on the way my bench points have been recently. So at least he didn't at least he didn't do that because there were still quite a few people who played him. But uh yeah, not not another yeah, another not great week for me. >> Misery, misery, >> misery all round. Right, let's look at some players to buy. So, one of the teams with the best runner fixtures between now and the game with 32 wild card, which is very popular. It's not going to be the same for everyone, but that is Liverpool. Um, and one of the players that people are looking at, actually, there are picks all across defense, midfield, and up front. Um, but the one that people are looking at this week, of course, coming off the back of a 17-pointer is Virgil van Djk. I think we should use this as a a bit of an opportunity to talk about Liverpool as a whole. So, they play Forest, West Ham, Wolves, Spurs, and Brighton in the next five before a potential gameweek 32 wild card. Baller X in the chat is already saying that he's buying Florian Verts. You've got Dominic Sabos midfield. You've got Ekit TK up front, you've got Van Djk, you've got Canate in defense. It feels like a very good opportunity to invest in Liverpool. I've got my eyes on quite a lot of them. We'll start with you, Stephen. You almost bought Van Djk this week. Um, any plans to buy more Liverpool for this run? >> No. Uh, thanks for the reminder, Harry. Um, sorry. Yeah, [laughter] >> I would I would love to get some Liverpool players into my team to be honest. I mean, yeah, you look at that run. I think uh Floyd Vertz has to be near the top of the list. Obviously, we both own Nekit and we were sort of talking about him before the before the stream in the sense that he's just not been putting away all the chances that he's been getting, but he is genuinely like I wouldn't call him a transfer in, but he's very far from a transfer out for both of us with these fixtures. And yeah, in terms of the defense, I mean, you could go for really any of them. But with those fixtures, it is justified to go for any of those defenders. But I think if you have the budget to get Van Djk, he is by far and above the the best defensive asset to go for from that Liverpool side. And yeah, they look like they've sort of shored things up defensively over the past 10 game weeks. They actually rank second for expected goals conceded per 90 just after Arsenal who have, you know, been firmly the top of that table for most of this uh for all of this season really. So Liverpool have the defensive data to, you know, back up going for one of those defenders now. And as Nikolai is saying in the chat, Far Forest are top five defenses for conceding from set pieces in all of Europe so far this season. So, uh, if there's ever a chance to to buy Virgil van Djk, this probably probably feels like it this is the time. He feels like he's worth the money again over Canate. There was that period where Canate was getting a few attacking returns. His defcon wasn't bad, but feels like Van Djk is probably safer. Although if you don't have the money, I think um think Canon is not the worst alternative. Tom, any plans for a Liverpool defender or a Liverpool attacker? You've already got Ekit. >> Yeah. Um I have a plan for Verts next week. Um which may involve avoiding Steven or Harry Wilson. Um, [laughter] >> but I I don't know if I want to do that with the ownership, but I I do like Verts and these. To be honest, I hadn't really considered buying Van Dijk just because like >> my defense is pretty set and he's obviously a lot of money, but like I guess the thing is obviously Arsenal blanking 31. Would you swap Timber to Van Djk at any stage? I mean, >> probably not. >> Not convinced. They do play Chelsea, but um, obviously, as we saw last time at the Emirates, we didn't really have a shot in that game. So, um, >> yeah, they probably do well in that game, but um I I just I I struggle to see how I would be able to buy Van Djk to be fair. >> Well, how are people buying Van Djk this week? Like Tarovski, is it? >> Yeah. Like for me, it would be Tarovski. I suppose if you if you don't want to keep Timber, like I don't think Timber to Van Djk is the world's worst transfer. I don't think it's a great move. I I don't think I'd be advising making it, but I don't think it's like off the cards bad. >> Yeah. I mean, with me, I've got Gabriel, Timber, Harland, Rice, >> and Richards. >> So, that's five >> next week if selling Chalaba after Chelsea defenders after 27 >> like Chalaba to Van next week. >> Yeah, that looks like an easy move to be fair. >> Um, >> but yeah, he's if if you're looking for a premium defender, he's probably the best. like if you um I mean everyone's got three Arsenal, aren't they? But you probably buy him ahead of Timber. Is that fair? >> Yeah, I would say with the blank now. >> Um and then I suppose if if you're saying it's not really worth it for the price, cheaper defenders. Um is there anyone in your minds at the moment that you think is a better pick than just spending4 million on James Hill? James Hill who is basically Sessi regen as he is just getting the defcon attacking returns that um Sessi got in the first half of the season and James Hill is basically doing all of that now. Is there any reason not to just buy Sessi 2.0 that is basically James Hill at 4 million because their fixtures are really nice. Yeah, the fixtures are really good and I feel like there's only one name and I I haven't seen anyone really talking about him. Maybe they have been on on Twitter, but there's one name and I'm sure both of you guys aren't going to like this transfer whatsoever, but I I must state this before I say this player's name. This is for people who are planning wild card. >> Yeah, I'm trying to work out >> wild card in gameweek 32. So, it's a short-term punt and it's a player that, you know, let's try and guess. >> He's playing He is playing out of position. >> I'll tell you that. >> Is it Coyote? >> It's not Coyote. >> Louis Potter. >> It's Lewis Potter with the fixtures that they have coming up. He's been playing he's been playing, you know, you know, he gets subbed offer in the 70th 80th minute. I'll give you that. But he just scored a goal against Arsenal there. He's playing out of position left wing. And these fixtures for Brenford are it is justifiable to go for Lewis Potter. I will say >> not to be like the >> the damper. Is Sharda going to take his place? >> Yeah, he started the last two with Sharda being out and he didn't start the three before that when Shard came back when Dango came back. >> Shard going straight back into this team. Is he is he back 100%. >> I mean, it's not 100%. I would it would probably concern me a little bit on um I do think the Brenford defense as a whole is quite an interesting topic though because I've looked at Vandenberg I've looked at Lewis Potter I've looked at Coyote and I've looked at um Ayair as well if I knew which if I knew that Collins was not going to come back in I think I'd buy a >> he's probably the one that is safest for minutes out of everyone >> cuz he's 44 his deathcon's really good and he's >> would you buy him over James Hill >> but Brighton at home Burnley Bournemouth Wolves leads is pretty good >> does he but is he one bad game away from Collins coming in >> I don't know >> the thing is he was playing next to Collins actually uh before Collins got got injured as well >> yeah it was Vandenber >> didn't start yeah they've had yeah they've switched it around a little bit 66 six as well. So, he loves, you know, a good header. >> Yeah. >> So, he's he's only been uh he's played 90 minutes every game bar one since gameweek 18. >> So, >> he hasn't scored since 2023. So, he is due, [laughter] >> you could say. >> He's he's due. >> What is going on? Oh, yeah. There is very slim pickings when you think about it for cheap defenders at the moment. >> If if they didn't blank, Gayhei would be bang up there. But he's >> again it's like Seno. He's going to keep scoring points for the next four weeks and we're not going to buy him. >> Um >> yeah, >> but yeah, it's hard to look past James Hill. Um >> got more praise. I think I've seen quotes going around if they're new or not, but Areola saying he's he gives us great presence in the attacking box and defensive box. Um he got 20 defcons against Everton. He's got Defcon's seven of the last eight. How he's got three assists, I don't know. But um yeah, he's it's just I'm pretty sure I'll be getting him for Duo at some stage. >> Yeah. >> Yes. Because I'm looking to downgrade Taroski. Um, and if I want to go to like Vert, I've got to pick a pretty cheap defender like around that 44 to4 million. Um, >> Mhm. >> and I've looked at Hill and I've also looked at Azure. Um, and it's pretty close between the two of them. >> Yeah, it's hard to say one of them will massively outscore the other. Um, >> no, >> three of the next five for Brenford are away. Um, shout out to >> who just said that in the chat. Uh, >> I've lost it, but yeah, someone said that, which is fair. Um, >> Coyot is probably the nailed Brenford one, but his his returns are just really poor. >> Um, taking the long throw in is not that conducive to getting assists. >> No. >> True. >> Um, >> no. >> I mean, the other one is >> the other one is Anderson. I mean, I already own him. Um the Fulham fixtures for the next five are very good. Like that's the same reason we want Harry Wilson. Um he's up to 46 now. It could have been Quanka, but Bassie played the last game last midweek, so it looks like that might have flipped back again. Um Anderson I don't think is a bad pick. Feels pretty safe, but he's not got that like high ceiling spike that some of those others seem to. >> Yeah, his fixtures are very good. the Fulham fixtures, Suddenland, Spurs, West Ham, Forest, and Burnley. >> Maybe they still won't keep clean sheets. >> Probably not. Probably not. I think um I do think that the majority would just go Hill now. I think >> I'd go Hill, Anderson, Brenford for me. >> In that order. >> Yeah, in that order. Yeah. I the reason I wonder about Brenford is I do think someone like I know he hasn't scored in three years or whatever it is but someone like Aair just strikes me as the type of player who could hit a 15 pointer or 17 pointer now whereas I just don't think Anderson or James Hill are really going to do that but but that's because I know Collins has done it. So then if Collins isn't playing I'm trying to replicate that with another Brenford defender instead. Um, >> would it massively shock you if they lost and Collins came back in? >> No. That he comes with the biggest risk. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Which is a shame. >> Yeah. As a Collins owner, I really don't know how to approach this whole uh this whole situation cuz Yeah. Let's say he doesn't start against Brighton. You probably think, okay, immediate sell, but if they get battered 5-nil, there's always a chance he comes back for the fixture. E even you know if they get battered 5-0 I'd be pretty confident that Collins would come back in but like if they draw to all or like they lose 2-1 or something then it's again it muddies the water for another week. >> So I think while they play well it will probably stay but yeah it's quite difficult. So maybe James Hill is just the if anyone's got any other cheap defenders that I would should be considering please let me know. It feels like defenders are quite difficult particularly this week. I don't love many defensive transfers this week. Like Anderson's away at Sunderland. I don't particularly love that. Like he's starting for me at the moment and I don't think that's great. Um Hill is away at West Ham. I don't love that either as a fixture. West Ham have looked pretty good recently. Van Djk if you can get him away at Forest. New manager bounce. Forest probably the team that you target especially with because the Forest play tonight. But if you can't get to Van Djk, I don't see many defenders I love buying this week. >> Yeah, because Palace and Chelsea are um obviously not long-term targets. >> No. >> Mhm. >> And they've got Burnley and Wolves this week. Um someone's shouting out leads in the chat. >> I go away to Villa this week >> from 29 though. Sunland Palace Brenford. >> Yeah. But my point is is if you're looking to make a defensive transfer this week, >> it's not great. It's not great. >> I mean, Sunderland at home to Fulham, go back to Muki. >> Yeah, but that's They don't have great after, do they? >> No, they don't. They don't. >> They must have locked out all his attacking returns now anyway. Surely. >> So, I'm just going to say it. I buy Ballard over Mki now. They're the same price. >> Yeah. I mean, >> fair enough. I' I'd probably buy Rain Elder and save what is it or something? >> I just buy someone else. >> And you don't care, do you? [laughter] >> I refuse to buy Mookie Alley. I can't. I'm just going to watch with him. >> Watch him score from like 30 yards at the weekend again. Um, but no, I I think Sunland, if you need short term, but yeah, if you're looking longterm, you probably buy the defender that you want most from next week and you just buy them a week early, I would say. I don't think the fleet is great. I was just about to say the exact same thing, Harry, because the fixtures really for a lot of the players that you'd be looking to get in in the defense. Yeah, you'd probably just buy them in and, you know, potentially even bench them this game week and then start playing them from then on. >> Yeah. >> Concer someone's mentioned. He's he just doesn't do anything, does he? Like there's no extra points. >> No. >> Never scores, never gets Defcon. And Cash is injured. So >> Cash might be back. If he's back, he needs Wolves, Chelsea, United, West Ham. >> Yeah, the the last update we had on Cash was two weeks ago where he said it would be three weeks, which would be a return this weekend. >> It's not bad to be fair, the next five. >> Nope. No, I quite like that. He's like sick. He was sixth on my rankings for best defenders to buy. If he's fit, >> who is top? >> Van Djk. >> Then Hill. It was Van Djk Gabrielle if you don't have him but it's virtually no one in that snow and then it was Hillya. >> Nice. >> Yeah, fair. Pretty agree with that to be fair. >> Um midfielders. So we've spoken about uh Florian Vver a little bit. Um we're going to talk a lot about these cheap mids because there's a lot of questions in and around them. The first question on a few of the more expensive ones. I've got Brian and Burmo. I am under the opinion that it's too late to buy him now because you've missed Spurs and you've missed West Ham and there are other players like Vert at a similar price um with better fixtures than him. But if you were to look at the more expensive ones, so what have you got? You've probably got Vert, you've got Inmo, you've got Rogers. Where does I find Rogers really hard to call cuz I'm never surprised when he gets a return, but I'm also never surprised if he blanks. I find him [snorts] really difficult to call and I feel really hindsighty that when he returns I think he's a good pick and when he blanks I think he's a bad pick. >> Yeah, I think that's all down to the fact that his data his expected data has never been insanely high. He does just >> rack up, you know, he he scores difficult chances and I watch him play and some games he'll look like so close to a 20point hole and then other games it's like invisible. So I yeah he is hard to predict but good fixtures coming up. He plays leads at home this weekend and then Wolves. So I really like those next two games for him. >> Yeah, I like the short term. Um but again like if I was buying Vert or I was buying Rogers, I think I'd go Vert. >> Can we talk about Seno first just to like >> Oh yeah. >> Would you? Because he is like >> I don't know. He he's obviously really highly owned still. Yeah, >> his hammer does this week. Still got four game weeks until the blank. Um, and City have four decent fixtures. Like it's it's one of those cases where we just overlook it because he blanks, but actually, you know, you bought him two weeks ago, you'd be you'd be loving life. So, >> so there is something else that's worth adding in here for anyone for all those Planet FPL listeners out there. If City go out of the cup to Newcastle, there is a possibility that City do not blank in gameweek 31 because neither City nor Crystal Palace will be in the FA Cup in that round that's between gameweek 31 and gameweek 32. So that fixture can just move from the Premier League weekend to the FA Cup weekend. And if City were to lose and that fixture against Palace was to stay in 31, we'd all feel really stupid for not buying SMA. It's hard to do it now, but there is a world that City might get knocked out away at Newcastle and then City don't blank in in 31. >> And when is the um fifth round? >> Do you >> Let me get that. Um, I suppose I still am under the idea that it's I I'm not buying Smeno because he blanks and I'd rather buy someone like Vertz and take the chance on that. Uh, the fifth round is on the 7th of >> So that's just that's after 29. >> Yeah. So you don't have much time to >> Yeah. >> So you have to buy him assuming he blanks effectively. >> Yeah. Yeah, cuz City are still favorites for that tie. Um, >> it will be close though. I mean, Bruno G's out for like two months, isn't he? >> Yeah. I mean, we've used our triple captain, so we definitely want him to um >> Yeah. Yeah. >> definitely want them to lose. >> But but you you can't but you wouldn't buy him for the next four though, despite it still being four weeks. >> I'd buy Verts, I think. Do Do you disagree? So I I I agree with you Harry. And the reason I think he's probably the better pick over Semeno is, you know, less about the blank, but also about the minutes. You you never know if Semeno just catches a cheeky bench in any of these games like And then Champions League. >> Yeah. Champions League coming is >> Yeah. And add on to the fact that there is potentially a blank. I feel like it's enough to just ward me off it slightly. Now, obviously, if he doesn't blank and plays 90 minutes all of these games, I look very silly after saying that, but it's you can't fault anyone for thinking along those lines. Not saying he's an avoid, but I'm just thinking if you had the option to go for verts over him, it's probably the the safer play. >> Did you know that Smen has played 90 minutes in every single game so far this season? >> I didn't realize. I was building a table for him and he's like top for minutes amongst all midfielders. >> Wow. >> Even since going to City, that's impressive. >> Yeah. >> He didn't even miss a game. >> That's it. >> Yeah. Every game he start every game apart from the one week for the suspension, >> he's played um Yeah, he's fourth for minutes amongst all midfielders, but that's only because the players above him. The only player to have played more minutes per 90 than him is Elliot Anderson because he's played the same and started every single game. >> Wow. >> And second is Semeno. >> But I agree, I still have a minutes risk with him at City as I do with any City mid. Like look at Fodden. >> It was only two months ago that Fodden was essential in this game and he was getting 10 pointers every week. >> Yeah. I mean, I I got I got into a dark place uh mid game week and I [snorts] started looking at Turkey and I was like, do I do this to myself? [laughter] >> No, no, no. >> I need some talking out of it. >> Just before we go to the cheaper ones, there's a lot of talk about Vert. Is Vert definitely worth the money over Sabosli? Because I was suddenly looking at what Sabosli allows me to do in my team. A 2 million difference between them. Spllight is playing more minutes at right back. Although Frim Pong is not expected to be out for very much longer and I mean isn't worth it. I I think I think V is worth the money to be fair. >> 2 million is a lot though. >> Yeah, but Versus like you look at his XGI subly like you know what he's like. He only scores from 40 yards. >> Um >> yeah, >> like he scored goals off 0.05 0.06. 06 and 0.03 this season. >> Yes. Um Vertz was Vertz was very lucky are very unlucky not to get more in that game against Sunderland. I think he had the post twice. >> Yeah, he added about 0.7 xG I think. >> Yeah, he did. I like Vert and I think Declan Rice to Vvers will be very popular either this week or or next week. >> Yeah. >> And Enzo as well. >> Next week. >> Yeah. and other replacements for Enzo is of course this big bracket of cheaper midfielders that we've got. So it's sort of the return of Harry Wilson with the fixtures going back to looking very good. It's Dangoara for the Brenford fixtures or it's new signing Ryan at Bournemouth. Any others in the chat before we start to pick them apart? Is there any other name you'd like to add into that camp? Jbury Hall. I mean, the fishes are not great. >> No one else. >> Tough. I mean, we mentioned SAR, but he has he blanks in 31. >> Yeah. >> So, we were talking off air that I was considering selling Elliot Anderson this week. And so basically the reasoning is and I've gone into the same dark hole that you've gone into in the past week Steven but thinking about Elliot Anderson in instead and Jbury Hall. Um but effectively the smaller the number of weeks the less good a defcon midfielder is right like you're never going to pick a defcon midfielder on a free hit. Like Elliot Anderson is never going in on a free hit. U so over even over a two week period over a 3-we period you're probably not going to pick Anderson because over two weeks Anderson's going to score eight points. The chances of you getting one of Anderson's weeks where he gets an attacking return or he gets bonus points are really small over a twoe period. But over a 10- week period, Anderson's going to score 40 or 50 points. And that's harder to replicate with an attacking player. So the closer we get to a gameweight 32 wild card, the less value someone like Anderson holds because it's easier to replicate his points in my mind over a shorter period of time. So I was wondering about selling him over Jubury Hall to one of the midfielders that we've got in this list. I'm a little bit like a bit like with you Tom. I haven't owned Harry Wilson for all this time. So do I try and find the next thing which is either Ryan or Dango or do we go well actually he's been not as great these past few weeks but this could be an opportunity to go back to him. Oscar Bob came off the bench for him. He's not playing 90 so much anymore, which I do think is something to consider. Stephen, do you own You still own him, don't you? >> Oh, yes, I do. He's He's not left my team. [laughter] >> Yeah, Oscar Bob is worrying me slightly because we know how good he is. >> He hasn't played any football though in like a year, right? >> No, but it's more like if Wilson goes from 90s to 70s, it does impact him, right? >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. when you're deciding between him and Dango and Ryan. Yeah, it definitely has to come into the consideration there. >> I mean, I don't think any of them have absolutely secure minutes. Like, they'll all be starters, but Dango has played backto-back 90s whilst Shard has been out, but played 59 53 since coming back from AFCON before that. Before AFCON, he was playing 90 every game apart from a couple where he got hooked at 65 and 75. Wilson, it dropped last game where he got taken off for Oscar Bob after 70 minutes. And the other one is Ryan. Now he has been playing 90 and 86 in the last two, but they have players like Tavanir not that far away from returning. So there are things that cloud his minutes as well. So I don't think it's completely clear as Michael was saying in the chat like Tava is going to come back into that Bournemouth team by the end by he's definitely backed by the blank right >> so and and Krooppy got benched so there is >> I worry about >> I just >> he's a young player he's come from Brazil it wouldn't shock you if the manager just said yeah have a week off you know like it's a bit like Chelsea are looking after Esteal you know um like it's a big adaptation no matter how well he's been playing to to now go out and start every single week. Um and like you say obviously Krooppy got benched this week. Like why can't Ryan get benched next week? Um >> that was the one in the chat. Uh thank you very much. Brooks is also just back. He came on for a sub against Everton last week. So he is now back and he was a starter at the beginning of the season. So once we get to 31 and Tavir is back, Brooks is back it does just cloud it a little bit. They've got Adley as well who scored recently, right? >> Yeah. So, even if Ryan's starting, >> his minutes feel the worst. >> Yeah, I agree. I think of all the narratives you said there in terms of, you know, the narratives around these players minutes, Wilson, Ryan, and Dango. The one that I would probably use to like justify a selection would be Dango because you could just say, \"Oh, he was building up his minutes since coming back from from AFCON,\" which I didn't really think is a like I didn't realize that's a things like that players needed to do after playing football in another country. Oh, you need to we need to ease you back in, but maybe it is. Um, but yeah, he's come back and yeah, he's he's got two nights in a row, so you would probably say it's his spot to lose. >> Yeah, >> I'd say his minutes are the safest of all those players, even more than Wilson. >> Interesting. Tav, sorry. Uh, Dango is the one who's top of my list at the moment. >> And is that for just because of his minutes or obviously taking everything into account, fixtures, data? >> The fixtures as well. Like I'm cautious of buying the player who I think looks best this week and looking at the player who I think is going to be the best up until that wild card. Can see Tom nodding hopefully in agreement. But Brighton at home this week is great. But even if he doesn't do anything at home to Brighton, >> I'm walking into Burnley away followed by Bournemouth away before Wolves at home and then leads away. Like leads away is actually probably the worst of those fixtures I'd say. Um so I like the next five the most. I think if you look at any of the others, there are specific games where I'm like that doesn't look as good. Like Wilson away at Sunderland this week, I don't think's perfect, but then after that it Spurs, West Ham, Forest, Burnley is very good for him. I think all three of them are are great. Like Ryan, West Ham, Sunland, Brenford, Burnley, United is pretty good. So I think it's tough. Um I think I probably will go against Wilson. He's also slightly more expensive. Yeah, I was. Yeah, I mean this morning I haven't really thought about FPL for a good few days to be fair, but then this morning I looked at selling rice and um basically I can do rice to Dango or Wilson um and then J Pedro to Thiago next week and then Enzo up to Vert. And if you want to sell Rice this week, Dango looks better than Wilson, right? With Brighton at home compared to Sunderland away. Um, >> yeah. >> So, that's kind of that's one aspect. I mean, who do Fulham have next week? It is >> Spurs at home. So, yeah, you you wouldn't mind buying him next week. I could keep Bryce and get Wilson next week, but >> Dango just looks good. And everyone has Thiago, right? So, it's gives you a little bit Well, it gets you the penalty winner um as well. So [snorts] >> Thiago's penalties, >> I think Thiago was about 40% own this week, but half of them benched him. So it was quite interesting to see like it looks lower when you look like >> scored, man. Like >> live FPL. >> Yeah, he showed up. If I get if I I just realized if I get Dango and he wins a penalty, I I'll be hoping that Thiago misses it. [laughter] >> Yeah. Don't buy Dango. >> Do we think D is better than Charda? I don't think there's worth the money difference. >> Yeah, because because Sharda had a period where he because when I write the captaincy articles on scout, I always look at the XGI last six and Shard was top for like a good four weeks, but I think that was because he scored a hattick off what >> that's because he scored he got 3x 2.94 xG against Bournemouth and scored a 20-pointer and so like every chart he was just like top off at like weeks on end. To be fair, he did still after that hit 0.7 against Sunland and 0.6 against Chelsea. So over like a fiveweek period, he he lacks more xG than anyone else. Um >> he's had eight and a half xG and scored six times. >> Who? Shard. >> Yeah, Shard. And Dango. Dango's played significantly. Dango's played 500 fewer minutes and has one less point. Um >> I think I'd go Dango, >> but has half the XG. So >> all his points are from winning pens though. >> Yeah, exactly. You can't write that into the data. >> Right. Um so we So my order would be uh Dango Wilson Ryan. >> I read that. >> Yeah, 100% 100%. >> Cool. I think there is because there is a midweek round of Premier League which could be a slight issue for someone like um Ryan which is gameweek 29 but then it is the weekend before the FA Cup which Bournemouth are now not in. So maybe you can read into that um as well. Maybe that's I don't know what you read on that for Harry Wilson as well. But let's have a look up front. I do think it's a pretty boring conversation strikers this week. Um, I don't really see any strikers that I really would consider buying that aren't Harland if he's available. Eatique and Thiago. Like J Pedro is great, but he's got Burnley at home followed by Arsenal away, which isn't great. Watkins, you got the issue with um Tammy Abraham there. Anyone else in the conversation? >> I I wonder a little bit about Chelsea, you know, like the whole thing is like you have to sell them after Burnley, but do you actually because they don't blank? Like I at the minute my plan is to sell Enzo and Jel Pedro next week. Albeit I would really want Thiago. So I'm probably not going to keep Jel Pedro. But like the two players there that are popular and have a 31 fixture. I mean J Pedro has done really well recently, >> but his data is still not very good as well. >> His data is still not amazing. I mean, watch the XA of being pushed over in the box for penalties three weeks, three times in two weeks. Like, that's you can't can't put that in the data. >> But >> I was watching the highlights for the game and I thought I was watching the previous game. I was like, did that it was in the exact same spot. It just gets pushed over. I was like [laughter] I mean, it's it's an interesting one because I've been thinking about Chelsea as well, Tom. And yes, they look so good, but you know, it's been against Leads, Wolves, and and West Ham. So, I'm not sure how I should read into this. Like, are they the free flowing attack that we all need to get them into our team or >> definitely more free flowing than before >> with Santos in midfield? 12 million pound by the way, what signing he was, >> but like we are better. I mean, but Pedro is doing that thing where he's basically scoring with every shot, which he did in the Club World Cup and at the start of the season, which is not sustainable, but yeah, I I' I'd probably sell Enzo for sure. I just like if Thiago got injured and I I had to keep Pedro, who plays in 31, I would be pretty happy to do that to be fair. >> Fair. Fair. Do you think Thiago is as a player that if you don't have him, you should try, you know, do everything you can to get him in? Maybe not this game week, but the next game week. >> Well, like do you think I should do Pedro to Thiago next week? >> Yes. >> Yeah, for sure. >> There you go. But is it like let's say like for for instance in my team I have Holland TK Mark Gu I would need to >> probably downgrade like Yuri and Timber to get Thiago into my team cuz I I have a pretty uh cheap midfield as well. >> I feel like >> that's different though. >> Yeah. I mean, what else could you I mean, we could maybe save this for your team, but like that is >> I do think um >> I do think forwards are quite straightforward. So, we'll go to Steven's team and we'll we can talk about it. >> Yeah. Just before that, I'll just uh play the video sponsor message. That's all right. Um thank you to British Army Recruitment for once again supporting the FPL Watch list. This episode of the FPL Watch list is brought to you by British Army Recruitment. You may already know how exciting and challenging an Army career could be. But you may also be wondering what's in it for you. On this podcast, we love sport and we love football. I'm sure that if you're listening to this, you do as well. You may not know this, but sport is built into your day-to-day army life. You don't have to squeeze football into your evenings because most bases reserve Wednesday afternoons just for sport. You can play rugby, football, cricket or practically any other sport you can think of. The army is also part FA affiliated with its own teams competing across the country and can even fund your qualifications if you wish to become a professional coach or referee. Some soldiers even go on to compete at semi-professional level playing at the biggest venues like Wimbledon and Twickenham. So whether you're in it for the camaraderie or aiming for the elite, the pathway is there with an army career. Plus, while you're doing all that, you're being paid to train in new skills, gaining civilian qualifications up to degree level. Away from the sports pitch, the Army is the UK's biggest apprenticeship provider and the number one apprenticeship employer as listed by the Sunday Times. So, if that sounds like your kind of team, search Army Jobs to find out more. That's Army Jobs. up for gameweek 27. Uh triple Arsenal defense against Spurs away in the North London derby with Rya, Gabrielle, and Timber. I've got um Munoz against Wolves at home here. Hopefully Palace can remember how to defend. They certainly forgot how to against uh Burnley last game week. Then a midfield of Bruno, Enzo, Rogers, Indai, and Wilson. And honestly, I love all the fixtures for those guys. And then Holland and Ekit up top. And I've got Alder Alderete first on the bench followed by Collins who is second on the bench and has actually been benched in real life too. And then Mark and Dravka obviously on the bench there as well. I've got two free transfers.1 nil in the bank and I think it's an easy roll this game especially with someone like Alderete against Fulham at home first on the bench. I can roll here and just take get a bit more information which I think is what I really need right now is more information on Collins and his space in the team. Is he second string now? Is he going to get any minutes against Brighton? If he comes on against Brighton, I'm still not going to know what to make of that unless obviously he comes on for an injured Brenford defender. But if everything stays the same with the Collins situation, it's it's difficult to think about where I might actually go. And the player that I really want is Thiago, but that would be a gameweek 28 transfer. And it would mean if I was to get rid of Thiago, I I wouldn't want to get rid of Ecitique to get him in. Or sorry, if I wanted to get Thiago into my team, Ekit wouldn't be the one to make way. I'd want to keep him and get Mark G up to Thiago, which would mean downgrading one of my defenders because I'm not going to get rid of any of these midfielders anytime soon other than Enzo, but I can't really downgrade Enzo to someone who who I want. So, it would probably mean getting rid of Timber when he plays Chelsea at home next game week. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but there is definitely justification to to do a triple move next game week, such as Gu, Enzo, and Timber out for Thiago, Dango, and Hall, or sorry, Hill. Um, and I I really like the look of that. I just wonder whether it's worth three free transfers. Can you do like Enzo, Guu, and Dai to um Thiago like Pots and Dango? Could you do that? >> Uh I think I could afford that. The only thing is Indai plays Burnley at home in gaming 20 uh 29. So I definitely want to hold on to him for that. >> Yeah, I think it's a definite role for you here and and get the extra information. Um, we are all just presuming that Harland's going to be okay. I mean, >> yeah, true. >> I mean, what what if he's not like >> there's your Thiago. >> I mean, you could Yeah. I mean, there's your Thiago route. You're in it actually in the better position if he does um he does end up being out like you just do Harland to Thiago. >> True. Yeah. Yeah. And then we'll all be thinking about getting I don't know, could even get Palmer into your team. the temptation if Harland's Ivy Palmer without a second thought. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. >> Um but yeah, I think you're fine to roll. Bruno captain. >> Bruno captain for me. So the way I think about it, right, I think on paper it's a tough fixture. Everton away, but when you look at the expected uh goals conceded for Everton over the past 10 game weeks, they rank very poorly. Um, so >> thank you very much, [laughter] >> Tacos. He's been so great. >> That's cuz Keen's been missing, right? >> David, >> no. [clears throat] >> Keane steals his Defcon. I've said this. >> He steals them. He >> does. He ended up on nine this week. >> I mean, I don't know who else to captain is my thing. Like, do I captain Enzo against Burnley at home? Rogers against leads at home, >> right? >> Ike has got my vice captaincy against Forest away. Obviously if Holland is is starting Newcastle at home, it's it's a good fixture for City. Um but yeah, I just like the assurance of Bruno against Everton away. >> If if Harland is fine, do you think you'll captain Bruno? >> Um I think I will. Yeah, I think I will. I think I'll still I think he's the best captain this game week. >> Fair. Um I can go. I am 343. Um, so I think one of the small benefits to my team, uh, is that my forward line I quite like. Right, Harland, Ekit, Kant, Thiago. I need them to start doing more points than they have done over the past few weeks. But I'm quite happy with that. Defensively, Richards at home to Burnley who now, sorry, home to the Wolves who now can't get Defcon. Gabrielle, and then I've got Anderson. I don't think Anderson's great this week, but I also don't love the replacements that I could buy. I'm currently benching Tarosski for him partly because I've got Inbermo and I've got Bruno in that game. And then so the things that I'm looking at with my team are sort of those three remaining midfield spots plus Taroski. So I've got Rice, I've got Anderson, and I've got Jesus Hall. Now, I think I'm going to put myself in a position where I whoever I keep out of Anderson and Jesus Hall, I'm not going to be playing them every week. Like, if I start doing cuz a lot of the explosive players that I want to buy are in midfield, right? So, Rice is probably going to go to Vert as an example. And then as soon as I start doing transfers like that, I'm not going to be playing Anderson every week, in which case his defconisty is really not very useful anymore. Like the benefit to Anderson is you play him for 10 weeks and he gets you 50 points and and that's that. If I'm not playing him every week, there's kind of no like I'd rather chance on Grey Hall in any specific week over Anderson. So I'm looking at doing Anderson to Dangertara, Rice to Verts, and Tarovski to someone cheaper in order to afford it, like the defenders that we've spoken about. I have wondered about not buying Verts and just buying two of the cheaper ones like going Wilson and going Dango and then doing Taroski to Van Djk or something like is Wilson versus Vert close enough in order to go for Van Djk over James Hill um effectively. But I think I'll probably end up keeping Jbury Hall over Anderson cuz as I said the closer we get to the wild card the less need there is for Anderson cuz it's five weeks right he's going to get 20 points I need two I need three goals or two goals to match that but I'm not going to start him every week like the week that Jbor has Burnley at home Anderson's going to be on the bench like next week there are weeks where I'm going to bench Anderson. So, I basically have to decide if I want to do Anderson or JP Hall out. Um, but the benefit to Anderson is I could go straight to um Dango this week. I can't >> Yeah, I think I think it's interesting. It kind of goes back to what you were talking about earlier in the stream, which I meant to say was something I hadn't thought of and actually a really interesting analysis in terms of defcon midfielders in the sense that what you said was over the over the short span of let's say five game weeks up until you wild card in 32, the benefit of a defcon player, a defcon midfielder is not there because you want them for the long term. And then if you add in the fact, Harry, that you're probably going to be benching Anderson in a few of those fixtures anyways, it means you would you'd probably want to hold on to Dooby Hall and play him in that Burnley at home fixture and hope that hope that you know he just has a as a as a decent decently big hall there and that it matches the amount of points that Anderson ticks over with over the next five game weeks. Like I'm probably going to play Anderson three times between now and my wild card and he's going to get 12 points probably. >> We've seen Debury Hall do that in in more, you know, more points than that in one fixture. He can be explosive. So >> the only negative is is the week that Jbury Hall has a good fixture is everyone else in my team also has a good fixture. So I don't really know like who I'd bench that week. Um but that doesn't mean I shouldn't keep Ju Hall. Uh it's like 29. So Liverpool, I'd have double Liverpool away at Wolves, so I'm not benching them. I'd have double Brenford away at Bournemouth, like maybe I benched Ango that week for him. Um or United go away to Newcastle, so I could bench um and Burma. But at the moment, my plan is to do either Anderson or Rice to um Dango. >> Surely you would sell Anderson over for one week. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah, >> but then I am also bench. >> I'm also tempted to not play either of them and play Juice Be Hall over both of them. >> You'd play Juice Be Hall over Declan Rice. >> Would you? >> Sorry. What have we seen from Declan Rice in the Well, I I don't know. I think >> I'm not convinced when you see the ownership statistics you would do that. >> Yeah, I'm probably not. [laughter] You're probably right. Um, but I don't think it's like cut and dry that Rice is better than Ju Hall this week. >> I mean, we may possibly be forgetting that Tottenham are shockingly bad and they're without their best center back to defense set pieces. >> Yeah, I mean, I probably will play Rice and I'll probably do Anderson to Dango. Um, and then next week it will be Tarosski down and Rice to Buts. >> I would. Yeah. I mean, I I would play Juicy Bey Hall over Anderson this week, but I'd also probably do Anderson to Dango. So, >> Mhm. >> Yeah. >> That's Yeah. Shame you're selling Anderson after all these weeks. >> I know. And then I'm going to get to the Anderson the the next Anderson derby in gameweek 30 and I'm not going to I'm not going to have either of them and I'm going to feel like a lost soul. I'm going to go into that [snorts] dark place that we've been talking about. >> Yeah. I think actually it's going back to your team, Harry. think it's maybe a more interesting discussion thinking about if you want to get Van Dijk in your team or not. How like you're sacrificing what to get him in. Is it Verts? >> Yeah. >> Is that closer than we think? You'd probably just go Vertz because it's more interesting than getting Van Dijk, right? I mean, if I do Anderson to uh fair, if I do Anderson to Dango, I can't do Takoski to um Van Djk. I'd have to sell Duo, which is fine. Um yeah, like it's what? Van Djk plus Wilson versus Vert and Hill. >> That's kind of close. I feel like it's it's a bit >> that is very close to be fair. >> Vert is the more exciting pick though, isn't it? >> Yeah, but I do have Ecat already. >> Ifike didn't score 17 points last game, it wouldn't be as close, but it is. >> Yeah, I think I think that's part of the the thinking with Van Djk that >> Yeah. the point recently have been good. Um, but yeah, although I'll probably do Anderson to Dango and then I can make the decision next week. >> Nice. Yeah, looks good. Looks good to me. >> Cool. >> Hope Richards turns up. >> Yeah. Well, like >> Oh, sorry. >> Sorry. >> If I do um just Anderson to Dango, do you think I've got my defensive bench right? Would you bench Tarovski for Richards and Anderson? >> Soft fixtures, I think. >> No. If I own two United midfielders, I would not play Tarovski. >> Okay, fine. >> Anderson would be the one, I guess, but Anderson probably has better chance at Defcon, right? >> Uh, I mean, yeah, trying to predict Taroski's Defcon at the moment feels absolutely minefield. Yeah, I would >> a lot of players in the [laughter] You've got a lot of players in this United Everton game. >> I know I'm benching double Everton for double United. We all know how that's going to end. >> Well, the reverse fixture was 1 nil with Juby Hall, right? >> Yeah, he scored outside the box. >> Yeah, that would be um >> that would be nightmare. >> I'm not sure I'd be here next Wednesday if that happened. [laughter] >> Right to you, Tom. >> Yeah. Cool. So likewise I'm on the Richards train. I've got Sanchez, Timber Gabrielle Richards, Enzo Rice, Bruno Fernandez, Morgan Rogers, Ecatik Xiao Pedro, and Harland captain with Yoke Anderson first sub. Um, two free transfers, 0.1 in the bank. Could very easily roll this to be fair. Um, it's probably would be the smart thing to do because I I'm pretty loathed to sell Rice before Spurs. But I don't know. I dango I the plan is obviously Ja Pedro next week for Thiago. Um and then I can't then I can do Enzo to Wilson I think. Yeah, of course I can because he's cheaper. Yeah. And then Vertz would be for Rice. Um, which again would be tempting, but it's whether I I brought forward the Wilson or Dango move basically for Rice this week. Um, >> and then to Enzo Optovert. >> Yeah, do Thiago and Verts in next week for my two Chelsea players. It's just it's kind of hard to call like would you rather if you're on a free hit, you'd pick Dango over um, right? Yeah. So, >> should I just get do the move? Don't know. Yeah, that's basically my decision. >> Yeah. Um, yeah, I suppose it's it's not quite as straightforward as that because if you're on a free hit, you don't have to worry about the after effects. Whereas, if you buy a player early, the risk of it going wrong needs to be considered. Like, if Daniel was to get injured, there's a benefit always to waiting and getting information. Um, >> yeah, >> I think your team looks good enough this week to roll. I think I'd roll. Yeah, it's looked good for the last two weeks and uh haven't really done anything. >> But yeah, I'm happy to have double Chelsea. Yeah, double Chelsea's nice and Rogers looks decent this week >> and so does Richards to be fair. I got triple Chelsea actually. I just saw Sanchez. >> Richards looked good last week though. >> I was just about to say with Richards, is there any justification to bench him for Anderson against Sunderland away? >> Not for me. I haven't considered once. Richards is a bigger goal. I mean, Harry was this was private. >> Did you just say Richard is a goal threat? >> No, because I think I have messages from you that say um Gayhey's left and Richards is is the one. But yeah, >> yeah, Richard become more of a goal threat and >> and he did actually score 5 minutes later after you said that. >> Yeah. >> Wow. He doesn't take the throws anymore, right? Because Lurma does, which is is better. >> Um >> Yeah, but he stopped getting Defcon. >> What did he get? He got seven. Did Kane steal his as well? >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Has Hasn't he swapped sides right to left center back? >> Yeah, he has. But since like >> Yeah, since he came back from injury, he he came back and hit 17 against Sunderland, but then had five, seven, nine, and six. >> But that was Gayhei right with him. Sunderland. >> Yeah. So now he's gone over to the left and now >> so the narrative is he hasn't hit defcon in four matches since Gayhei left >> and he swapped sides. >> So >> so Mark Gay continues to ruin my rank. >> Yeah, it's not ideal even when he's not there anymore. But since Gay left he has got two big chances I think >> or two >> any love for you on a captaincy that's not Erling Harland Tom >> on the vices on Pedro >> Michael has just said in the chat he'd be all over Pedro captain it's just I just look at Pedro right and I don't see like his numbers are still pretty poor >> he's not going to win penalty every week but it's Burnley and Burnley are so so bad so >> wait for Pedro What are the expected getting pushed in the back for this game? [laughter and snorts] >> But how bad is a Stev like and who's their other center back? It's like Twanzy's injured, right? Who is it? >> Steven's just gone off the rails in the past five minutes. >> Could Esowski Kyle Walker, 40-year-old Kyle Walker probably, >> and win a penalty, but then it's not Pedro, is it? That's a stupid thing. Um >> I don't know. It's It just wouldn't shock me if we won 4-0il and Jal Pedro blanked. Does Is that fair to say? Like it just he's kind of like a one shot one goal guy. I He's not a volume guy. Like if you look at his like he's nowhere near um like Enzo and Palmer are both ahead of him for HGI the last six game weeks quite comfortably. >> Well, >> yeah, I think I probably would be on Harland, but I think Ja Pedro is really close to Harland. I think Palmer I would captain over Harland. >> Same Palmer over Harland for sure. >> So if Harland's out, Tom, you're captaining J Pedro presumably. And Steven, you're captaining Bruno. >> Yeah. >> Idea what I'm doing if he's out. Probably on Thiago, captain at this rate. >> I I I think I'll still captain Bruno's fit. >> Fine. >> If he's out. >> I don't know who our captain. It won't be longterm though. That's the thing. So you're not going to sell him, are you? No, I mean, yeah, like if we're in the situation that he's out, then >> just I just play >> Hampton's what a sub. [laughter] >> I get to play Jbury Hall. >> That's Yeah, it's Monday night fun, isn't it? >> There you go. >> Exactly. >> Um, right, I think that is all. Thank you all very much. Uh, if you could drop a like on the stream as we haven't plugged it throughout and subscribe if you are new. Both of you, good luck with your triple captains this evening. I hope we are here next week talking about a Gabrielle hatrick and Arsenal dropping points. That's what the ideal scenario for tonight's game is. I think a 3-3 draw with a Gabrielle hattrick assisted by Declan Rice. That's what we were hoping for. Uh nothing else is >> Tim. It's cash in the xG time tonight. >> Yeah. >> Did you see you weren't watching Harry, were you? But he he was in on goal in the 90th minute and he didn't have the pace and he passed it and then Martinelli missed which that was quite exciting. But yeah, >> ex excitement is David Stardy is [laughter] just nice and boring. >> I get to I get to see Dav Ri get to two saves after about 20 minutes and make he was in tears at Brenford. Um he was moaning so much about set pieces doing exactly what Arsenal do to opposition keepers. >> Yeah. Anyway, >> yeah, >> good luck everyone. Good luck in Cambridge 27 and yeah, we'll see you all next week. >> Good luck, [snorts] guys. >> Cheers, guys. >> [music]"

      "transcript": "I'm >> [music] [music] >> really [music] [music] >> [music] [music] [music] >> Hello, hello, hello and welcome to Scoutcast brought to you by Fantasy Football Scout. And as always, you're joined by me, Andy, FPL mode. And we're also joined by the other two people who I feel like I haven't seen in a while because there's been a lot going on and also not a lot going on in a weird way. But we are joined by Nacho and Hibbo. Nacho, a pseudo red arrow for you at the moment. What's going on? Yeah, it's um good evening by the way everyone. Hope everyone's as well. But um yeah, it's it's a red arrow, but like you said, I feel like it's a fake red arrow. We said it before, we still have a game to play in game week 26. Now, I know on this stream right now, it is an official red arrow, but with Arsenal still to play and triple Arsenal on my team and a triple captain active, spoiler alert, um I'm hopeful that Gabrielle bags a hat-tick and delivers a green arrow for me. So, yeah, it's a it's a fake red arrow, we'll call it. >> Yeah, it'll be green. It'll be green before the end, mate. Don't you worry. [laughter] Uh, and Hibbo reporting to us from the Matrix by the looks of things with all the little things going across your screen. How's it going? Green arrow for you. And is that blood I can smell? >> It's good to be back obviously and it is a bit of blood I smell. So there's there's been a bit of kind of forward momentum for me like it looks like potentially five Green Arrows and I think how good the green arrow was depends really on Gabriel Triple C tomorrow night. But look, I think last I look forward to we're a wee bit premature with this stream, but look, the show must go on, but we've got a big blank gameweek luminance 31. We've got a FA Cup unpacked from the last week, and we've got like future blanks on doubles. So, here's hoping for a good show. >> Yeah. And this is this is the best time for FPL when we're now talking about doubles. We're talking about blank game weeks, we're talking about how to use the chips properly. There are a lot of people out there that have already used a lot of chips and navigating what is coming up in the game weeks is going to be extremely difficult, but it can be done and obviously we're here to help you on both sides. Now, the game is going on tomorrow. So, the second game for us was going on tomorrow. I wouldn't say people were overly happy with what happened in the first game, but I don't think the first game was the targetable game. Brenford looked good. Obviously had a few chances against them. Gabrielle got booked. did get defcon but obviously lost his clean sheet so only three points for triple captainers out there. I did see some people go with a Madeki punt. Fair play if he went for someone like that. Obviously did quite well. Rice got defcon as well and I think got one bonus in the end too. So it was a little bit of a anti-limax for the first game but Wolves away that's surely the one where Gabrielle like Nacho's already said gets a brace a brace minimum I would say. So let's see what happens there. Now tonight we are going to be looking at our points. we're going to be looking and obviously those are points that aren't finalized yet because we got tomorrow night's game. So, we've got a lot of players uh playing there. I think we've all got the exact same three and we're all on triple captain. But apart from that, quite exciting. Uh we got XGI tables, we got Cbit tables to look at. We're also going to have a quick look at the FA Cup ties as well because that does inform us as to what's going to happen moving forward with blank game weeks in 32, no 34, and double game weeks in 33. We've also got uh going to have a look at this next gameweek coming up, gameweek 27, because we've got goal predictions, we've got fixtures, uh we've also got the com teams and we've got our bus teams and Q&A at the end as well. So, we've got an awful lot going on this week. So, without any further ado, let's have a look at some points. And this is how I am looking at the moment with one fixture still left to go. I've got 55 points and I played my triple captain and it was my defenders that pulled through for me this week. Rya with two points, but then we got Gabrielle triple captain with nine at the moment. Nico O'Reilly with 13 points. Absolute I honestly I just wanted him to get to 60. When I saw he was starting I was like just get to 60. Just get don't even care if it's a clean sheet. And then he popped up with a goal. Lovely finish as well. Uh although he will less to be said about Anderson's challenge on Harland on the halfway line that could have him injured for the next week, but we'll talk about that later. Uh and then James Hill was my transfer in this week for Doru. 4.3 million to 3.9 million. Hill got an assist, got bonus, so he ended up with nine points. Very very happy there. Uh Anderson with five. We'll be talking about Anderson in a minute. Uh Rogers with two, Fernandez with two, Enzo Fernandez with two, Rice with four, Harland with five, and Echitique with two. and all of my bench dravka crew Muki and Anderson with ones and twos respectively now 55 points a nice little green arrow I think it's about 100k green arrow but that does mean that since what was it 3 weeks ago I've had nothing but green arrows so fingers crossed that carries on this week as well the only thing that will stop that now I think is I don't know Wolves obliterating Arsenal but I don't think that will happen nacho 43 points for you but hopefully you'll get a nice auto sub of hill coming in for Richards Oh, that hurts. That hurts. [laughter] That hurts so bad. Cuz Hill was I'm just reminding myself was my boy in gameweek 25. He come in clutch with a seven-pointer. I feel dirty doing this to him, benching him. And I've been trying to justify my decision cuz for those that are listening to the podcast, I have Hill. I benched the nine points, I believe it was. Yes. And I played Richards for the zero. So, I have Rehea with a two-pointer and Gabrielle triple captain. O'Reilly with a 13-pointer. Similar to you, mate. I was just hoping that he was starting and the fact that he got 13 points. And for those out there that have owned O'Reilly for the last month or so, it feels kind of like the loyalty is paying off a little bit because he was a player that was on the chopping block mainly because of the rotation, but also of blank gameweek 31 coming up for Man City, we think. But now with him playing in the midfield and scoring, it feels like almost a great differential for the next few weeks. So happy to own him. Richards as we know still has a game to play on that one. Um to the midfield just blanks everywhere. Fernandez, Enzo Rogers, we're going to say Rice is a blank in the context of things for me and Lefi with a two-pointer. And that was the big one for me. It was Lefi versus Hill in terms of which one to start and of course got the wrong one. And I thought Sunderland might be a bit better against Liverpool than what they were. Clearly not. And then Ekit and Harland again, Harland flagged. Big thing for me Echitique right now is I need to understand whether I'm putting the my my love for him as a player over actually how good of an option he is right now in the game. So hopefully we'll talk about Ekitique later on because I think there's quite a split right now where we all know he's a baller, but I'm not seeing any points and we got to talk about that. two players really really quickly I want to talk to you about Nacho before we go on to Hibos because they're in your team and they're not in mine or Hibos. Number one, Richards. I was so close to going Richards. I was so close to go Riches because obviously he's ridiculously cheap. Burnley at home and then Wolves as well. Like lovely fixtures. >> Nobody could have seen that coming, could they? They were two-0 up and then to lose 3-2 to Burnley. For him to get a zero pointer, you just have to chalk it up to It just happens sometimes, doesn't it? >> Yeah, 100%. It's more of a team thing really than a Richards thing that I'm looking at. And again, for those managers piling in possibly to Palace with Wolves at home in gameweek 27, I don't really think it's the players we need to worry about. Like we said, it's the team in general. To concede three against Burnley, it's either a fluke or it's going to be a sign of things to come. And I'm looking right now and it's been one win in the last since gameweek 15 for Palace. So, I think things are still looking a bit poor there. >> Yeah. And uh before we move on to Hibbo, the last one I wanted to talk to you about was Lefi off penalties it looks like. >> Yeah, I think I think that could be the case. Um and for me, a player that has been awesome at times hitting Defcon now and then, but as a budget enabler, I do think if you're looking for one right now, I think maybe Juice Behaul could be a better choice than that of Lefi going forward for those that are interested. >> Yeah, nice. Uh Hibbo, on to yours. Top scoring so far this week, 58 points. And me and Nacho there flexing because we had O'Reilly. Talk us through your lovely little central defender there. >> Well, I'll flex. Don't you worry. I'll flex. So, obviously the game week hasn't ended. So, we have to give the position as it is now. and I made one transfer and I did Sar and for Marcus Tiveri I kind of felt like I wanted to attack Burnley and Wolves at home and like we've talked about this already like Palace obviously disappointed like conceded 3D Burnley was a bit of a surprise but there was goals in the game for Palace like you know Strand popped up with two for some people like PZ you know that that took the punt and so we early disappointment but back to front I think for the podcast people with two Gabriel with a nine because of the chopped with two and then big Virgil came up trumps. So he got a gold defcon clean sheet and top bonus >> and I was so g giddy I wrote a Valentine's Day poem for uh oh god >> big Virgil on Twitter. >> So then we we go to we go to midfield sorry Enzo and Bruno wall got two. Rice got defcon obviously but then Palmer keeps doing Palmer things. He got 12 points >> the pay goal assist yard top bonus but he must an absolute sitter at the end. It must have been muscle season and that kind of prevented like a like a 17point hole like you know which would have been >> ridiculous hole since I've got Palmer but the really good fixtures coming up and then up top we've got Holland with a goal in the early bath so he's possibly injured an injury doubt for the Newcastle game and I think we'll talk about that throughout the pod and then Krippy with one so all in all pretty happy over the last few weeks I think I've kind of taken the the path a we bit less traveled with Palmer because it was a big differential we fixtures at that point in time and there was obviously a lot of rust going with him in terms of his minutes but he's kind of nearly single-handedly got me back under the game and I think when you see both teams nobody will be surprised who be captain this week. >> Yeah, I did uh I did call you out a couple weeks ago saying would you captain Palmer against Burnley at home? Obviously Harland decided to have a yellow flag to make your decision a little bit easier but we won't talk about that [laughter] too much. Um, I like the fact, by the way, yeah, VVD obviously lovely there, but absolutely brilliant. You took his V's away and you got nothing but the D left. uh when we nacho [laughter] nacho um one player that I think I'm the only one out of the three of us that has him and I have to talk about this because I'm seeing discussions about it and actually there's not often that discussions happen that kind of get to me a little bit and they are starting to get to me and the player I wanted to talk to you about was Anderson because >> he has been unbelievable this season and if anybody has watched forest play at all this season he's been incredible he's hit defcon I think me and Hibbo were talking about before we came on 19 times this season. So an extra two points 90 an extra 38 points with Defcon. He's also got bonus quite a few times as well. And obviously they keep keeping clean sheets every now and again too. So he gets bonus there. Now I have him. You guys don't. I'm seeing a lot of people talking about him saying he is the epitome of what's wrong with FPL this season. That Defcon is not what we should be. We shouldn't be celebrating Defcon. Defcon's been the worst edition ever. We are celebrating counting interceptions and things like that and it's just not what FPL should be. I look at it completely. Maybe it's just because I own him. I think it's brilliant. We got this cheap player that is getting me four to seven points every week while I've got premium players like Rogers, Bruno, Enzo, Echitique all blanking for me this week. I see it as anybody can own him. What's the problem? What What's your take on it? because I'm starting to see people saying, \"Nah, this isn't right.\" But I I don't really see much of an issue. >> I think this is the classic thing really where So, so look, don't get me wrong, if you said to me, \"What type of FPL would I rather play? A game where I pick loads of fun, excited wingers or sentiments that hit defcon, obviously we're all going to choose the game where we all have fun midfielders that bag loads of goals. But that scenario just doesn't exist, unfortunately, and it's just a madeup world half the time. The fact of the matter is FPL this season have introduced defensive contributions that impact defenders and midfielders. And people that are complaining about the situation, I think I've just not adjusted to the game quick enough right now. Simply put, we're in a position right now where we have cheap enabling midfielders like an Anderson who has hit Defcon every single week and you can still have Anderson in your team and sprinkle in these exciting players alongside it. But if you haven't adjusted right now to the defcon part of the game, then I think unfortunately you you're being slow to the party. That's how it is. It might be the same again next season. It might be boring and you absolutely can swing against it, but I think you are fighting against the tide a little bit at times. And people like yourself who have got Anderson who got a tick over four or five points each and every week, that is consistency that sometimes we want from our fifth midfielder. But I think it comes down to the fact of ensuring that that guy isn't your third midfielder. I think then that [clears throat] could be an issue. But the way that you structured your team with Anderson being your fourth or fifth, I think it's the new norm and it's going to continue to be if we see this next season. [snorts] And he is an outlier. Like he is the only one doing it. Obviously, Kaiseda was doing it for a bit, but actually that was, you know, spr I'm going to use your adjective sprinkled in with adjective verb even uh sprinkled in with um you know, he was getting goals and assists at the beginning of the season, wasn't he? Whereas there isn't that other midfielder doing it. He is just having an unbelievable season. And Hibbo, he's not taking points away from attackers, is he? Like he's not taking points away from Rogers and Enzo Fernandez and Echitique. It's just that those other players aren't doing it this season for some reason. >> No, I think that's a fair point and we talked about it before we came on air, but I think we Anderson one really important thing to remember is he was predicted to do well >> like going into the season like we obviously had sways of data from like last season and the previous season and people were able to model defcon and we were quite accurately or scout and people on Twitter were able to quite accurately predict that Anderson was going to be a good player against this magic. Now he's proven himself to be and one of the conversations we had before we came on air was about say crippy you know you're looking at people like Krippy and Mane who are strikers and around the four and a half mile price point and you know I've been taking punts because I've got a bit of weird price point structure in my team I'm playing like a crippy every week anderson's what 5.3 million >> do do you know like you like you're backing crippy like in my situation I'm backing crippy hoping that he goes out scores What's best case scenario for him? He's going to score a nine. What's the most likely scenario? One or two points. Whereas Anderson's floor is just always like if you look at his scores this season, it's just four points, four points, four points, but going up as high as nine. So, he's just proven himself a really consistent performer. But I think you make a really good point with Anderson, how cheap he is, and it touches Nigel's point. He's a fat midfielder. It's not an eitheror decision. You know, I don't think you have to pick between Anderson and Flair players in midfield. Like you're picking between Anderson, Lefi, Tav, you know, they're the players that you're talking about at that price point. And for that, he's completely stand out. And like I think from a football perspective, what we're going to see Anderson at the end of the season, I think he's going to go to Man City. Do you know like he's been he's been hardly taught by a big move and off the back of the season like he's not going to be for us next year. Like he's going to go to the World Cup. He's going to have a blender at the World Cup and like he's going to move. >> I think if anybody watches him, he's incredibly good. I just think when you've played 26 game weeks, if if you're not adapting after 26, I don't think there's anybody else to blame then really. I I could be completely wrong there. But I just think, you know, if there are still people that are picking fullbacks instead of center backs at the moment, like it's the game at the moment and unfortunately it's just how it is. But I just Yeah, I just feel like after 26 game weeks, Anderson's there and he's he's just unbelievable for the price as well. Um if he does go to City, by the way, hell of a signing for City. I think he's exactly what City need, exactly what they need. Um right, let's have a look at the XGI tables and move off of those cheap midfielders and talk about some premium ones because Palmer is top of the XGI table after over the last six game weeks. If only we had if only we had somebody somebody that was a Palmer truther that really told us to you know invest him and really trusted him in those times. Um so Palmer 5.66 xGI over the last six game weeks. Thiago is in second. He's the only other player above 4 XGI. Bruno Fernandez Harland Echitik Enzo Fernandez Ral Gimenez. Bruno Gimme who is out it looks like for potentially eight weeks. Uh Zavi Seimons uh is in ninth. They're all above 3xgi. Then we got Vert, Salah, Jensen, Mtoma, Jao, Pedro, and Adley for Bournemouth. Now, Nacho, I kept money in the bank this week to make sure I could get Thiago in. Thiago at 4.15XGI. Fixtures are looking quite good. He's not the only Brenford player that you could invest in moving forward. Is Thiago top of the list for you or would you go with one of their rather lovely midfielders? Yeah, it's this this is obviously the week where a lot of people have pinpointed for Thiago. And for those that are wondering why Thiago is is interesting, obviously firstly second on the list for XGI in the last six game weeks. That's a big bonus. We know he plays guaranteed minutes. He's on penalties. Importantly as well plays in blank gameweek 31 which is something that we all have to factor into. We'll talk about it in a bit but blank game week 31 for those that are not looking to wild card in that week of free hit. He has leads away in that week. So again, all real positives. Burnley away. I would even say Brighton at home in gameweek 27. The way that Brighton are playing right now is a good investment. Now, probably those that have owned Thiago over the last month are going to say the complete opposite. They're going to say to me, \"Naturo, you're an idiot, mate. This guy's been blanking because I'm looking at it. Yes, he scored in gameweek 25, but he was only a five-pointer. He's only scored one goal in the last, I believe, six game weeks. Prior to that, he had his two double digit returns. So, I get it. It's been probably a quite a frustrating time owning Thiago, but when we're coming into this period right now with the fixtures coming up and the guaranteed fixture in gameweek 31, I think Xiao Pedro is the fun exciting pick, but those fixtures are ending after gameweek 27, some would argue. So, I get the I get the buy of Thiago and I do think he is a nice safe pick for the next five weeks. Does safe mean points? I have no idea. But you get all those big factors that I spoke about. >> And obviously I mentioned the midfielders there. Would you be going Dango or would you be going Sharda, do you think? >> Um I I think Shard is quite significantly more expensive. Just reminding myself. I think he's like 2 and a half million more. Am I right in thinking? Yeah. 6.9. >> Yeah, >> 6.9 for uh Shardai and Dango's currently at 5.8. And obviously Dango's minutes have been pretty decent since he's come back from AFCON. So, I think I'll lean towards Dango myself as the choice. But, am I sitting there right now confidently picking him as a as like a big scorer? No, I'm not. I still think Thiago is the main source of points in that Brenford team for the next five weeks. >> Yeah. Um, Finley Craig, by the way, says, \"Show the non-penalty xGI.\" Now, interesting you say that, Finley, because I was going to ask Hibbo about Palmer, and obviously I bet you there aren't people saying that about Palmer, but they are about Thiago. Thiago was brilliant against Arsenal. Genuinely he played so well against Arsenal. Palmer though you just said Hibbo missed an absolute sitter. Could have got another absolute hall. I mean it's already a hall with 12 points but could have got an absolute hall again. Are you a little bit worried though that if Pedro stops going down in the box Palmer does nothing? >> Not really. Um what I would say to funly is like penalties are a thing. Do you know like and and they do happen like Palmer had a ridiculous amount of penalties. Some of the penalties themselves were ridiculous because like I think the busy all pushing the back against leads people were saying that wasn't a penalty. I thought it was the biggest stonewall penalty of all time. But >> was it was it? >> I think >> that was a penalty. It was a penalty surely because in the box you can't put your two hands in a you can't put two hands in a man's back because it's an automatic. I said no but that's an automatic give me for the striker because the striker was going to go down that position. Do you know whereas >> people would lead one? It wasn't a >> It was the lead one. >> The lead Oh, that was a pen. No, [clears throat] >> that was a stone wall penalty. Um, [laughter] but what I will say is Palmer's got some good nonpen xG. Like I think if we're looking at his nonpen xG against leads it was like 0.9. That's good. Like against wolves it was 0.22 and against West Ham it was 0.65. >> He wasted he wasted 0.7 of that in the last shot. I so like in those games he's kind of had definitely against West Ham at the to death he had a very big chance and against in the in the la the last game he had a massive chance that he missed at the very end they won the game for Chelsea. So am I worried as a Palmer owner after getting 39 points in three games? No, [laughter] I I don't see any worry whatsoever. But where I think there's a decision on Palmer is like you're seeing people going out to buy him now. Yeah, I was going to ask this. Yeah, you >> I think it depends on hand to be completely honest with you because I think and this is like a greater discussion. I think the big thing for people this week is who did the captain if Holland doesn't do I was never captain in Holland this week from like way back and I told you to take the bet. You wouldn't you wouldn't take the bet because you just >> you were in control. >> It was all in my hands what I was going to do. So I was going to be able to won the bet anyway. But Halen's out this week. Who do people keep capping? Now people might go Bruno because he's got the Everton fixture. People might go a wee bit flare and go in. They might hope that Hans fit. This Burnley fixture is basically the last of the good fixture run for Chelsea. Do you know like you're looking after that they've got Arsenal away, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Everton. Now we spoke about it before we came on air. from my perspective because we're heading towards blank game week 31 because he's already a player that I know should play or he's got a fix that week I'd be inclined to hold but it's hard to justify buying a player after they've got like 2017 they've got Burnley the next week I think if you're going to buy them and you have enough free transfers to buy them this week so say for example Hans out but you have like three or four free transfers if you can make like a switcher to get Palmer in that would be grand but I think a lot of That thinking is based on is Holland out for more than one game? Because I think if Halen just misses Newcastle or there's a bit of doubt in his fitness, I don't really think he could take him out. But I think the buying point to me feels like a past, but I think this week is the big week. This is the 20 pointer. Gary Neville would have said this is the banker. >> It can never fail. It will never fail. >> It might fail. >> It depends, doesn't it? I mean, like I said, if Pedro's got a bit of lead in his boots and decides to stay up, Palmer's not going to do anything. So, we'll see what happens. Um, [laughter] >> better. I've never seen you that triggered before. This is what happens when we uh who was it said it red monkey in the chat said, \"This is what happens when we connect you through a VHS player.\" Look at that. Look at that [laughter] that connection there. Um, Nacho, you mentioned a little bit about Dango there. Another player that's probably going under the radar, mainly because he's only just come in, but he scored three goals in three games, is Ryan from Bournemouth. Do you think especially with with Bournemouth's fixtures as well, Bournemouth are second for fixtures over the next five. Do you think Ryan's worth a shout? >> Oh, like I mean firstly, if anybody had any knowledge on Rayan prior to his Premier League entrance, then fair play. You've done a good deep dive. I cannot sit here right now and kind of tell you the pros and cons of him. Obviously, he's looked fantastic in the time that we have seen him, but it is it's only been two starts in the league, obviously against Villa at home and then Everton away, but he scored in both games. He's looked lively obviously. Um, the thing about Bournemouth right now really is that I don't really know. We are at Bournemouth, aren't we? Sorry. Yeah. >> Yeah. >> Sorry, I just Yeah, sorry. I was just I was just thinking then I've like pivoted from Brenford very quickly but sorry Ryan in terms of price point 5.5 million for me with the fixtures coming up of West Ham Sunderland and Brenford the next three and Burnley while I think we're Bournemouth right now we don't really know where to invest our money I know Kroo Junior has been quite popular but again when we're looking at him as a forward he's a great enabler but when we're looking at these cheap midfielders at 5.5 I like it I still think you're rolling the dice I still don't think there's been enough information to suggest exactly what kind of player he is. But if we want to go there, less than 1% owned, if you're looking to pivot away like me from a Lefi to someone a bit more exciting, then I can get behind it. But it comes down to the same argument, doesn't it? An excited winger like Rayanne versus a safe and steady pick like Anderson from Not Forest. Where do you two go? I don't know. >> I I like Ryan. I think he's really good. I think he's super attacking. He's raw and you could see that because he gave away the penalty as well. But I I think he's a really good shout. I actually like him more than Krooppy in terms of an FPL asset. I think Krooppy is still going off 60 70 minutes all the time and even not starting now because they're starting to get a few players back. I I think I think it's a really good shout personally. Um looking at the C bit tables, Chaloba is top of the sea bit in terms of def percentages hit over the last six game weeks, but he is joint with James Hill. James Hill is now at the heady heights of 4 million. That's how much he will cost you. Chaloba at 5.8, but only one clean sheet over the last couple. I think Chalaba was one of the guys that keeps getting mentioned in terms of he's they're a bad defense, but he keeps getting Defcon, but that's kind of how it works. Uh then we got Strike in third with 80% defcon hits. Marillo, Tibbo on 75% and then loads of players on 67%. Ballard, Dunk, E, Steve, uh, Maveranos, Rodon, and Sessi with Kena, Romero, Ya, and Humphre all on 50%. Oh, no, sorry, Kena and Romero on 60%. Now, Nacho, I'm coming back to you because it's Chelsea. Chalaba 5.8 million. I was saying we got to get this guy because the fixtures for Chelsea, but my goodness, all the data we saw that Chelsea were quite poor defensively has come to fruition, hasn't it? >> Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes. Um I mean we have been very good the last few weeks is worth noting. Like we've been good under Lim Rena. We played good football. Absolute car crash moments in that league's game which are just player individual moments which anyone saw that second goal. Oh my god. Like what what is going on? Um Chelsea have this in them in them. Whatever game it is, we have the ability to just kind of like cause chaos. whether it be someone like a Chaloba, a Tosen, whoever is at the heart of that defense. And as we know, Sanchez, while he's been great this season, can have his moments. I think the big thing is what's coming up. So if you're looking to invest in Chelsea, do not do it. The only way you do it is if you're buying in 27 and wild carding in gameweek 28 because the fixtures are just not good enough at all. In terms of Chalaba as a pick, if you own him, you don't have to worry about it. you play him this week, but I think that is going to be a player that quite quickly needs to leave your team. As we mentioned from gameweek 28 onwards, um it's just a total avoid right now with Chelsea. We're really good going forward. We look exciting and we do play the right midfield now of Andre Santos and Kaiseder as a bit more stability, but the people that are behind them still have those lapses of concentration. And for some people out there who are Chelsea fans suggesting that >> if we do fast track Madus quickly into this team there is a chance that he could steal some minutes because I know it was only a very very easy game against Hull for Chelsea in that sense but looked impressive. I do think he is a standout player. Are they going to chuck him in the deep end in the Premier League? I don't know but I think there's another player who rinia knows that could easily take some minutes from Chalaba if we see a shaky moment here and there. Yeah, saw some weird reports and obviously not so sure how much to believe in it, but that Chaloba could be gone as well at the end of the season that they don't really fancy him. Not sure how much to really believe that, but I thought it was an interesting report. Um, >> Hibbo, an interesting development over the last couple of weeks. James Hill's obviously come in. I know two of us here own him. He's come in. He seems to be taking Defcon away from Sessi. Sness is not guaranteed to hit those 10 defcon at the moment because James Hill is just hoovering them all up. How quickly should Sessi owners move from Sessi to Hill and save themselves 8 million? I think well [laughter] I think it's a very luxury transfer you know like to go sess and you're obviously you're obviously joking there but we talked about this again before we started the stream and I think one of the real benefits to looking at this dev gone table and it's interesting that two of the three have gone there is that for a long period of time we saw that James Hull like after he made the three appearances he was sitting 100% and he's kind of stayed at 100% ever since for Devcon and it maybe shows the benefit of looking at this table because look maybe after a point in time we could have felt that we've maybe worked out the defcon defenders this potentially shows that after there's a slight change within a team that's maybe going to affect the balance and maybe one of the center halves is going to go on the slight decline because Sessi's numbers are still good but Hal has been stand out I think people have got a couple assists from them as well >> but if you're looking at the Bournemouth fixtures going forward I think they look good you're looking West Ham away Sunderland at home Brenford at home Burnley away and then Man United blank game week 31. So they do provide a bit of cover in the 31 week although they're probably not the best fixture that week. I can see people investing in Bournemouth and I think if like many people do if you have issues around your defense I think I would be looking at Hover over Sessi and I don't think I would have any real doubts about his minutes because he's come onto the side and he's been a standout and they've kind of improved since he's joined and I think this is a great run of fixtures to get behind Bournemouth. I think >> he'll be the fifth defender of choice on gameweek on a wild card 30 31 32 I would have thought. Um >> yeah, let's have a look at the FA Cup fifth round draw then because and Hibbo I've I've gone to Naturra a few times tonight and this is your moment to shine because I'm going to talk about this one in terms of the permutations for gameweek 33 and gameweek 34. So I won't go through well actually do you know what I will go through them. We've got uh Fulham and Southampton, Port Veil or Bristol City against Sunderland, Newcastle against Man City, Leadeds against Norwich, Mansfield versus Arsenal. My goodness, Arsenal. Uh Wolves versus Liverpool, Rexenom versus Chelsea, West Ham versus Macklesfield or Brenford. Now, the big thing there is that we don't have an awful lot of all Prem ties. Now, Hibbo, for anybody that hasn't played FPL much before or hasn't followed people that obviously think about double game weeks and blank gameweeks, why is that big for double gameweek 33 and blank gameweek 34? >> Well, I think what we're seeing here is that there's there's like a fair chance that Premier League teams all qualify for the next round, which is effectively the quarterfinal. So like we call this traditionally the fifth round which is like the round of 16. The next round's the last eight which is the quarterfinals. There's a chance that we could see eight Premier League teams getting through there. Now after that happens what we're most interested on from like a fixture point of view and the impact in the FPL is the semi-finals. Now if you just think about this logically four teams can get through to the semi-finals. So what what the what the scenario that we want to see is we want to see Premier League teams progressing through rune five through six which is a quarterfinals and a semi-final draw. But it has the potential at the moment because of how this draw has split out and because of how soft the opposition is you know like you're seeing Arsenal against Mansfield and stuff like that. You're seeing Chelsea against Rexom. No offense to Rexom. You're seeing even Sunderland against Port Failure Bristol City. the chances there now for the Premier League to get plenty of teams through to the last eight and then the potential that there could be like four blank game weeks or four four fixtures that blink in gameweek 34. Now what is expected is that those fixtures will jump forward and they double gameweek 33. So lots of the kind of thinking that you'll see and lots of the kind of posting that you'll see in social medias people are going to talk about in terms of strategy they're going to dead enter their team under 31 and effectively what that means is just using your transfers they patch your team up week by week knowing that you're going to wild card in 32. Now what'll happen then is people wild card and 32 load up to play the big double game week in 33 or a bigger bigger double game week than we were expecting more than likely bench boost but the teams that double in 33 are more than likely going to blink then in 34 do you know so I think we're going to see a scenario I think there's been a bit of change in the last few days where people that have the wild card and people that have the free hit and people that have the bench boost it feels at this point in time that they have a much bigger advantage in the field. Now, this could completely scupper. Do you know there could be there's always cup upsets. Do you know >> some some lower league team could take out a Premier League team and it could whittle down the numbers and we could end up with a lesser amount. But I think the general feeling is at the moment we could see three or four fixtures ending up as a blanking 34 and those potentially coming into 33. And I think for people that have chips left, it means that if you've kept them to this point in time, you can really maximize like that last seven, eight game week run of the season, unload your chips and hopefully go for a big finish. So I think people who are maybe sitting around where like Nacho, myself are sitting at the minute, say 100, 200k. I think they could have a lot of hope in this draw. >> Yeah, 100%. I mean, even I'm looking at it thinking 500k I'm sat at the moment. Obviously after Gabrielle gets a brace that could be 400k. Um, but looking at it and thinking with the fixtures with the fixtures that could be coming up and the blank game weeks and double game weeks, there's so many gains to be made. But Nacho, there are people that have used their wild card. They had some gains from their wild card. Fair play. If you have used it and you've got this now and you're looking at it thinking, my god, I've got to start thinking about that. Is it just all about trying to bank as many transfers as possible? Is it about making sure not to invest in in blank gameweek 31 players? What would you be doing? Yeah, it's obviously difficult and we need all that information right now, don't we? Really, to to know what the plan is. I I think if you're in a position right now where you don't have the wild card available, then banking transfers, I think, needs to be the priority really to give yourself some flexibility, you might be in a position right now where in the next few weeks, just having that temptation to go for some rogue players might not be the best route. I think keeping with the players that are safe and steady picks for the foreseeable future is the only play that you can have. I think there is an opportunity over the next couple of weeks to roll transfers. I think there are some good fixtures upcoming. I think there are teams to target like we said about Bournemouth but I think if you're in a position right now where you don't have the wild card and again Hibbo said if you have the wild card I think you'll have an advantage. If you don't have it, I think you've got to try and get a bank of transfers available so that when the picture becomes a bit clearer from gameweek 31 onwards, you can just focus on buying those players that going to get you through that period. And while it might not be the most optimal way of getting through, it's the best way you're going to get through without a wild card available to you. >> Yeah, it's it's going to be tough potentially, but um it can still be done. And obviously there's going to be a lot of people wild carded and bench boosting stuff where they get rid of players that end up scoring a lot of points as well. So it can happen both ways. Uh let's have a look at this week though because it is Chelsea that are fancied the most. 78% chance of beating Burnley. 2.59 goals projected. Then we got Man City that are second with 59% uh 2.08. Sorry. And there's also Arsenal at 60% but only 1.78 uh goals projected there. Now, Hibbo, you've got a certain Cole Palmer in your team. Now, you haven't mentioned him at all leading up to this stream on this stream for the last couple of weeks. He is second on the list in terms of captaincy this week. Uh he's obviously got goal potential 0.50 projected and assist potential 0.31. He is just behind Harland, but obviously Harland is yellow flagged as well. Don't sit on the fence. Is Palmer the best captain this week? >> Yes. >> Good lad. And Nacho, what? [laughter] So, you've just said there obviously yes. You've also said you wouldn't be investing in Palmer. Is that because you want to keep Palmer's ownership low or is that because you think people shouldn't be investing in captaining >> this guy? No. >> Not this guy. This guy. >> No. Look, he's a differential. You know, I like the fact that he's a differential. I've kind of t myself down this path where I looked at these couple of fixtures and there was risk involved and whenever I made the move initially obviously doesn't feel great about it, but it's improved and I've got points. When we look at this table, I think it's important to bear two things in mind. One that assumes to start does Holland start like he didn't start the last UK game. We talked about this just before the stream. Marmush started instead. So is there the potential that we basically everybody has to watch Man City training this week and see do we see Holland on training pitchers now there could be a scenario where people see Holland and training pitchers coming towards the end of the week and they think that's a good thing. It might actually be a bad thing because you could be lured under a false sense of security where you think, \"Oh, well, he's my default kind of captain by choice. The fixture from like a projected goal point of view is good. I'm going to go there. He's my default captain.\" But is there the potential that he plays 60 and comes off? Is there the potential that he starts on the bench and comes on for a cameo? Is there the potential that he knows so? So, I think these things are possible at the moment. Palmer's also a midfielder. You get the extra point for the goal, etc., etc., But I think when I look at this fixture for Palmer, I think he's a complete standout. I think Burnley were beat by Mansfield Town in the FA Cup. I think they're absolutely pathetic. I think I agree completely when I chose points. Renior has been a breath of fresh air. I really like what he's done since he's come on to Chelsea. He seems to have got Palmer back playing again. And I think if we look at Palmer's minutes recently over the run that I've had him, I think he's played like 90 60 90. Now the 60 was nearly like he was protected because they were playing Saturday, Tuesday. So I think he can nearly discount that a wee bit and think he's come out himself and saying he's playing with a bit of an injury. He's still got a we bit of a problem but they're obviously managing it. I think if he's playing two games a week it's a problem but I think in this scenario and we talked about it a week or so ago in our last part there was such a big gap. They rested him against Hall in the FA Cup. I think he flies here and he's completely fat. And I do think there's an argument that if people have hand this week and we creep towards a weekend that it looks like he's potentially out. I think the people that have all their chips and do have a bank of transfers could potentially say well look I want to be hyper aggressive and I want to go and buy a Palmer and I want to captain this week because there are other routes if you don't want to keep them longterm. Do you know the week after I think and you're going to laugh at me now the week after Liverpool play West Ham. Do you know people that go down that route could maybe say well what could I go Palmer in a shortterm punt then flipping and captain come that week. No but I do think I do but you said this but you said this when I talked about captain Palmer against Burnley the opportunities do exist and I think they do exist. >> If Hal's out I think if Hal's out it's there to be aggressive because we're looking at a player who's maybe 150 160 170% EO every week just wiped out of the game like that. And I think it's it could be exciting, but not this week. Everybody leave him alone. I want a Palmer for myself this week. So, >> yeah, exactly. Disgusting. Uh I mean, Nacho, if you if if we're getting any idea that Harland is not playing this weekend and you don't own Palmer, where are you going? >> Honestly, I'm looking at my team right now and it ain't looking pretty at all in terms of where to go. Um I mean when we look at the list you got right now Harland let like I said we're playing out the scenario that he he's out and Palmer a player that might be quite difficult for those to buy. Then we got the Crystal Palace boys. Again if you didn't invest last week you could go this week but I just don't really think it is worthwhile buying a player who is going to blanketing game with 31 and doesn't have amazing 28 and nine fixtures. And then we got Watkins, Echit, Enzo, Thiago, Liam Dilap, and Mo Salah. I mean, based on my team right now, he isn't on the list, but mine would either be Bruno Fernandez. I know he blanked the previous week, but prior to that, we're all talking about how he's like the best value midfielder in the game. He's he's amazing. So, I think Bruno Fernandez would be be my default captain, but I also do think if I were to buy Thiago, he also would be a consideration for me. I think the Brighton fixture is really good. I think Brenford have been really impressive as a team and even though Thiago hasn't had the returns, the numbers have been there and he himself has actually just looked really good in games. So I actually wouldn't be against going for a buy of Thiago this week and also a captain on him if we get the news that Harland's out and you don't have access to Palmer. Enzo for me I think is an option but I also worry that there could be moments where he could possibly play 6065 and then comes off. I don't have the absolute guarantees on Enzo. >> Yeah. I mean, what do you do with Harland, mate? If if he's out for a week, if he's out for two week, I mean, if he's out for two weeks, that means he only plays two in the next five. >> Do you sell? >> I'm just looking at the fix. This is the thing. I'm just looking at the fixtures right now just to see what the turnaround's like. And, you know, we've got the we got the Newcastle game this weekend. Weeks rest until leads away. Now, leads away is a tricky game. Could I also see City just romping up and scoring a couple of goals? No, I wouldn't be against that. Then Forest at home, West Ham away, which is proving to be a bit trickier, and then they have the blank. I personally would need to have absolute concrete news that Harland's going to be ruled out, and then selling him would be a viable move. Do I love it? No, because I think he could score against Leads and I think he is a captainable player against Nottson and Forest. But if we were to get news that he's definitely out for gameweek um 27, I think for those managers out there that are looking at their ranks thinking, I need to shake things up a little bit, then I think there is a possibility of maybe if you have a couple of transfers available, pivoting from Harland down to a Thiago and then using those funds to take a punt somewhere. But again, please be cautious because if you're using your punt on Palmer, it's great for one week, it's a problem after that really. I if if he's out and it comes and it turns out he's out for a couple of weeks, if I sell him for Thiago, I'm gonna have 10 mil in the bank. [laughter] >> I'm gonna be I'm gonna be walking up next game week just showering everybody with money. Yeah, just by Salah. Goodbye you, mate. Uh looking at the fixtures, uh [laughter] in terms of attack, so fixtures for attack in the next five game weeks, it's Liverpool, Bournemouth, Chelsea, Man City, and Brenford that are top five. Hence why we're talking about Ryan. Hence why we're talking about Dango, Sharda, Thiago and that lot as well because they're in fifth. In terms of defense though, Arsenal are top. I think Arsenal are always top anyway. Liverpool are in second, Fulham are in third for defensive fixtures over the next five. Bournemouth are in fourth and then Chelsea in fifth. So hence why me and Nacho have obviously invested in James Hill. Anderson is still very popular. This is obviously accounting for the blank as well. So Arsenal and Crystal Palace, Wolves, Man City obviously are quite low. I mean, Man City are still in fourth for attack even with a blank. Uh but it does kind of give you a little bit of context as to why they might be a little bit further down there. Um but yeah, Fulham and Bournemouth third and fourth for defense is interesting. Nacho, talk us through the com teams though because there's a bit of a cushion between fourth and fifth. Well mate, got to give you your flowers because as you know, you've been on a decent run recently, haven't you? and you've pulled away from the depths of rock bottom and mate it's looking quite rosy now the league again there have been some winners and losers this league there bottom OG com team 40 points it's been a poor couple of weeks from then they need to bounce back just looking at what they actually done in gameweek 26 no transfers made which is quite interesting played the triple captain on Gabrielle but really with the 40 points and die which is a big differential don't get me was really the only standout performer for them this week. They have got the triple arsenal still to remain of Timber, Gabrielle Rice. And when we speak about who really is left in that Arsenal team to hurt rank, probably is Timber out of everybody who if you don't own him, that could be the one that actually does have the upside that could deliver. But not the best week for the OG com team. You're now currently 23 points clear of them, mates. So, I'm telling you, >> we ain't doing nothing this year. There is no punishment I'm feeling for us this year boys at all. Um but I have to give more flowers here to the new com team because they made one transfer. Remember they've got loads of transfers available. They are absolutely rolling in transfers. The one transfer they made was Dravka to Jose Sar and they bought him in the moment where he decided to go mode in that game for anyone that watched it. The most ridiculous game ever by Sar against not Forest. I believe they had upward of 25 shots. Am I right? I'm in thinking in that game for Anderson loads of them. Yeah. >> Outrageous. And um 12 points for S. And also he does have another game to play against Arsenal. We hope he doesn't deliver in that game. Outside of that, they had nobody else really that delivered. And they also played their triple captain like everybody else. So fair play. Sar was an inspired choice, but of course they will be hoping he doesn't deliver this week with their triple Arsenal. But from a punishment perspective, we're looking quite quite clear in this league, which is great. >> What's the rules for this punishment? What's >> We haven't really decided, have we? I don't know whether it's got to be both teams beat us or whatever. I don't know. Maybe if any of us get beaten by both. >> Yeah. >> Well, I'm pull a finger out then. Yeah, definitely. >> There's always a keeper in a double gameweek, isn't there? There's always a keeper that hauls and obviously Jose Sar was the one this week. >> That is a fair play. That's a baller move, isn't it? Dun de Bravka and Jose Sar. Fair play to him. Um and also they're both timber owners and I think Ben White got injured, didn't he? Um at the weekend. So I think him and Califury both got injured. So it should be pretty much the exact same team you would have thought apart from Celiba coming back in. Uh let's have a look at some bus teams then. So uh I've got Ryer in goal, Gabrielle, Muki, and O'Reilly at the back with Rice Anderson Rogers, Bruno Fernandez, and Enzo Fernandez with Harland who is my bus captain at the moment and Echitik. I've got Krooppy Junior, Hill and Anderson on the bench with Dravka. I got 2.8 million in the bank because I what was it? Sold Sacka to Rice a couple weeks ago and I did Duo to Hill to free up some more money because I wanted to be able to do Krooppy Jr. to Thiago this week. So, that is still I'm pretty sure that's what I'm going to do, but obviously I'll wait till after the Arsenal game because an injury in that could obviously force my hand a different way, but I'm pretty sure that's what I'm going to do. The thing I'm not a massive fan of is then having eight players to choose from and most likely benching Anderson every week who's been great for me like since I sold Foden. So, I'm not a massive fan of that, but it does look like it would be him that kind of hits the bench most of the time. Rice is the one that stands out for me. Now, Rice is the one I'm looking at and thinking Anderson's been great for me. Rice is what I want Anderson to be, but he's not doing that, if that makes sense. So, I've got a few decisions to make there, but I do think Spurs are there to be got at from Arsenal that week. So, definitely going to be getting Thiago in and then it's basically do I bench Anderson or Rice. It's probably going to end up being Anderson, but I got to I I did all these plans to get Thiago in. If Harland's confirmed out for a couple of weeks, I do Harland to Thiago, I think. I think that just makes sense. I can't keep Harland when he's only going to play two in the next five, but we'll see what happens with that. Every chance he just plays anyway. Uh Nacho, two free transfers, 2.8 in the bank. I think your team is looking pretty good with that amount of money in the bank and those free transfers. I think you're in a good spot. Oh >> yeah, this is a this is a tough week this week. And by the way, thank you for cursing me. I'm I'm going to have a woeful week now. So, thank you so much for that, mate. Yeah, criy. Um, yeah, I couldn't read out the team minute, but like you said, two free transfers, 2.8 million in the bank. So, strong place to be. Double Arsenal against Spurs with Rya and Gabrielle. Richards at home against Wolves. Again, we I'm just going to roll the dice once again on Crystal Palace and hope they bounce back. And then I've currently got O'Reilly at home against Newcastle just because him playing midfield right now just kind of elevates him as a pick from both a minutes perspective and also from a goal threat perspective. So whereas he doesn't really hit defcon and no joke I don't think he hit defcon once weirdly in gameweek 26. I need to double check it but he played midfield and I honestly don't think he hit defcon in it. It was really weird like and I mean any defcon I'm just double checking. Sorry I give you two seconds. He hit zero. So he's offering nothing really as a defender apart from possibly goal scoring. >> In terms of the midfield, we've got Enzo, Lefi, Rice, Rogers, Fernandez, and a front two of Harland and Echit. I'm currently benching Hill once again. So I'm asking, >> can I just say for for people listening on the pod, he's got Enzo and he's got Enzo Lefi, not just Enzo Lefi. He's got Enzo and Enzo Lefi. [laughter] >> Yes, great shout. Yeah, Enzo and then Enzo Lefi. That's right, mate. That's a good point. I forgot about that. Um, hill on the bench. Now, look, just for my own clarity here, am I right bench and hill with the choice here, boys? So I can hold you accountable. >> This is all you, buddy. Um, >> okay. Well, I'm bench and hill at at current. >> I think I think that's right. West Ham are good at the moment. I I fancy them to keep going and and do well at Bournemouth don't keep a lot of clean sheets. So I think you're expected is it but are you going to be making a transfer? >> Well, this is the thing. There is a chance I do Mark Gooey to Thiago and just get it done. and I've got the exact money to do that and then it would mean I bench Lefi at home against Fulham which is a decent fixture or I upgrade Lefy to somebody like a Rayan or someone like that >> or a Dango. So I have I have multiple routes. I'm at a good spot. If you had to tell me right now what to do, I think Mark Guy to Thiago is the move and then next week trying to pivot towards a bit of a differential midfielder like a Florian Vvers by selling Rice and Enzo. >> You must be pretty close pricewise with Guy. Is it dead on? I was going to say I thought it was cuz I knew I know mine was Crooppy to Thiago and I'm point four and obviously Gooey is >> 3.4 less than that. So I I thought it must be close but yeah. Oh, I can't wait to see what you do. I think Thiago makes sense because of the pens, doesn't he? But >> it does. Yeah. >> Yeah. Uh, Hibbo, talk us through yours, my man. Because obviously Oh, by the way, I don't know what happened, but you've got no captain or vice captain on yours. >> What does this >> which I think is hilarious [laughter] considering you're so big on Palmer. >> I'm going to have to have a chat with management about this. But anyway, >> oh, while Hippo's talking about his, chuck in your questions as well. >> Do that. So, right, this is me. I've got 1.5 million and one free transfer. Overall starting 11 feels okay this week, but like I've got some overall squad issues and I generally feel like I'm kind of lumping towards the dead end 31, but it's okay. I don't mind it. So from back to front for the podcast people, I've got Ray and Gabriel away at Spurs. Virgil's at Forest. Aldre and Anderson playing the same game home and away. Then [snorts] midfield I feel looks juicy. So Palmer's obviously the boss team captain have Burnley. Sar's at home to Palace. Bruno and Everton and then I've also got Rice and then up top Hen's obviously an injury dude. So in terms of high level thoughts about what moves I'm going to make like I'm looking at this team right now and like the the player I would really want is Thiago. Now I can't get there on one move from Krippy and like I look at the Brighton fixture. I think that's a very good fixture for Brenford. Brenford have been very good at home, but they've got Burnley in the gameweek after that. And then I'm looking at the overall balance of my team at the moment so far for this game week, and I feel like my team's well set up. So, at the moment, I'm feeling very much likely that I'm going to roll. Now, I think the only thing that would change my mind on that is a timeline in hand. Now, the likelihood is we aren't going to get it. But if Pep came out and said Hal's going to miss the next two games and he was honest, I would just do Holiday Tago and get it done and take the cash the bank. Now, the major kind of rub there is I think around game 28 or 29. I think he's at home forest and he's best captain by a mile. So like you're you're taking them out of head of kind of Le Forest those kind of fixtures West Ham maybe as well and you're thinking do I really want to be backing against Holland at that point in time? Not really because the ranks kind of recovered. I feel like I'm getting in a good position and I don't need to be taking on too much risk and that's why I'm leaning towards like this week role feels like default and the role would be to set up the week after a move where I get tag one and I think I would maybe go for somebody like Dango. >> Mhm. >> Those Brenford fixtures feel good. It's along a vein with similar picks where where I've gone recently where I've tried to pick a player who's kind of got lower ownership. He's got good fixtures in the short term and we can back him right through to that kind of blank game week 31. So that's high level thoughts. At the moment it feels like a role. But look, let's see. Like if if Pep comes out and says Hans absolutely screwed, then I think I'm out. >> I think roll makes a lot of sense for that team, mate. Not going to lie. >> I I kind of feel like I kind of feel like I have to roll. I kind of feel like a role to then make the adjustments a week after. But you know, I think you're looking at the midfield net that looks well enough set up this week. My defenders are starting to look a we bit flaky. I still have Ashley Barnes. So if I score you boys this week again with Ashley Barnes in my team. What? You have to do a forfeit. >> He says this. >> You have to do a forfeit. >> The only one with Palmer. The only one who' be captain in Palmer. Oh yeah. No. If you boys beat me, stop it. Stop it. [laughter] >> Absolutely. And also, can I just say, Ho, if you roll and then you get the double Brenford attack, I actually really like that. I think they're the type of team where you can double up on them. They did it earlier in the season and people doubled up on Thiago, Dango, Sharda, and they came out trumps. I I think it's a really good move personally. Um >> that move would be basically Rice down to Dango and Krippy up. If I if I could stretch the Barnes up and keep Crippy, I would maybe consider that too because he obviously has the potential to play in 312. So, >> yeah. Nice. Uh right then, let's have a look. Uh, Tiger Tomsky says, \"Should I move off triple Arsenal defense?\" Nacho um is well eventually will because they blank again with 31 unless you're planning a wild card and a free hitting. Again, I don't think you desperately need to move away from them. I still think there are going to be clean sheets to be had. Spurs, I think Chelsea at home is actually okay as well. So, it's not a desperate move, but yes, you are have to do it in preparation for a blank 31 if you don't if you're not using a chip. Sorry. >> Yeah. Danielle says, \"Best FFS trio as always.\" Keep up the good work, fellas. Thank you very much. Full of ham. So, I play Muki, Wilson, or Andy this week, Hibbo. >> Oh, he muted me. >> Yeah, you're muted. I think he sneezed and he didn't unmute himself. M at home >> Wilson. Yeah, Wilson >> Wilson's away and then in D is >> that's an easy easy >> M. I like it. Uh yeah. Um Danielle says, \"Who are two decent midfield differentials to dead end into 31?\" Nacho. >> Well, I I think I think we've been talking about the the cheap ones really. The differentials are going to be Ryan and uh Bournemouth and they're also going to be Dangotara at at Brenford. I think those are the two really nice differentials that also give you a fixture in gameweek 31. >> Yeah. Um I know who Hibbo would say. Salah. Oh yeah, got a great differential. Uh Ata Boy [laughter] at Boy says, \"What is the last time when is the last time Pep was clear in a press conference about his squad? I don't expect clarity on Harland Hibbo. >> I don't really expect clarity either. And I think the way that the fixtures are looking for this week, do you man play at 8 on Saturday night? >> Is it? Oh, >> they're they're they're a later game. Like I think there's very little chance. How long do I get that the fixtures up here? I think there's very little chance that they play at 8:00 on Saturday night. There's basically no chance >> and they're at home because you know the way sometimes they're away and then people say, \"Oh, he hasn't traveled, etc. I think there's very little chance that we get anything unless Pep's completely honest, but I think the main steer is always going to be training pitchers. I think if people are looking at training pitchers in the leadup to the weekend and Han doesn't train, you're going to have to assume he's not playing. >> Yeah. Runner Bean 78 says, \"Who to transfer out first, Enzo or Rice?\" What do you reckon that? >> Uh, is that this week? If it's this week, you got to keep Enzo unless you get some sort of news that he's obviously injured or or a minutes risk. Um, look, otherwise I think Enzo after gameweek 28 is is a problem with the fixtures, but Rice is blanking at 31, so that will become your main priority. Uh, Derek Null says, uh, Hibbo, please rate these Rice replacements. Palmer and Bumo Rogers verts >> come. >> So what and Bumo Rogers verts and Palmer? >> Oh, Palmer number one, Palmer [laughter] number two, Palmer number three, and Palmer number four. >> Like it like it really helpful. Um [laughter] um right. And what was the last one? Oh, yeah. Uh motivation says, \"Do I sell Gioarez or do I assess after tomorrow?\" So if somebody got in Joarez for their double game >> confused your looks >> mate there were there were people that did it. I saw a lot of people go he's the one to buy because obviously he was getting points off the bench he had a few holes off the bench people bought him. If you bought him for the double game week what do you do with him now >> Selda Thiago. >> Yeah. >> That's easy >> nice I think. Oh yeah I think it is big time. Right. Uh thank you so much for all the people that are in the chat that dropped your questions in. We tried to answer as many as possible and congrats to Col as well. We've upgraded you to being a uh moderator as well. So well done my man. Obviously the dreams can come true as Gabrielle always said. Uh right, let's have a look then. Thank you so much. [laughter] Exactly. Uh thank you for all those people that listen uh to the stream tonight. Thank you all the people that listen on the pod and all the people that watch the stream back after as well. We had I think we topped out about 350 people which considering everybody's forgot FPL exists I think that's pretty good. Uh Hibbo thank you so much for joining us this evening my man. Hope you enjoyed yourself. >> I have. Well you just talked about can dreams come true and like my dream comes true every week when I get to stream with you boys. So [laughter] >> I could have sworn he was going to mention Palmer then but he didn't. >> Yeah. >> See you next week. I'm going to have a big massive like poster of Palmer on this wall. Right. just like >> I bet you any money you won't have that poster up. Uh Nacho >> going on the air. [laughter] >> Thank you so much for joining us even my man. It's nice to be back. >> Pleasure boys as always. Always nice for three of us to get green arrows. So it's lovely as always. >> Yeah. Well, two3 so far. Two third so far. >> No, I'm preemptive boys don't. This will be a green arrow. This will be a green arrow. >> Uh right. Thank you so much everybody. We will see you again next week. So, we'll have the end of this one plus next week's 27. And obviously, we're going to be thinking about 28. So, we'll see you then. Have a lovely week. Hopefully, after Gabrielle's brace, we will all be loving life anyway. So, see you all soon. Bye-bye."

Um we were just chatting off air then we've still got one more game to go on Wednesday with um Arsenal, which is >> a big one for for both of us and a lot of other managers. But um but yeah. Yeah, doing okay. How are you? You all right? >> Yeah, good, good. Um yeah, this never ending game week. Uh just carrying on and on and on. Yeah. So, um even if all my Arsenal players blank, um I should get um my I should reduce the um >> the red arrow that I've appear to have accumulated this week uh with every single one of my players blanking apart from Harland who I wanted to blank cuz he's not my captain. Um >> but um we'll have a look at your team because you did a little bit better than me and you're on a green arrow uh at the moment. Um, so he should be a bigger green arrow, you would think, with triple Arsenal to come. >> Um, also we'll have a look at your plans uh for the coming uh game week. Uh, and also we're going to have a little look at the fixtures, but also um Brenford players who were excellent against Arsenal um and have a much better fixtures to come. Um, so a lot of their assets are certainly um in demand. So we'll have a look at them and see which ones we might consider as well. Okay, let's have a look at uh how you got on. So, we still got another match to go. Uh 54 points, triple captain Gabrielle. Um yeah, do you want to take us through your team and whi which moves, if any, you you you made uh going into this game at 26 fixtures. >> Yeah, sure. So, I'm on 54 points. That I think that will go up to 55 because Rice is due to get a bonus point in the next update. So, go go go up very marginally. I made two transfers. Um I took out Cells and I took out Bowen >> and I bought in Rya and Strand Larsson. >> So um >> yeah because Bowen got the assist. Um >> I think he came out with six points from that game. So I was a little bit unsure of that after the first night. But then Strand Larson even in a defeat managed to get the brace and the the maximum bonus. So happy that that paid off >> and I rolled the third transfer um for third free. So, I've got a couple couple to work with this week. Um, so I'll just run through the team. I've got Ryer on two points, one match to come. Gabrielle has three, but nine as my triple captain. He obviously goes to Wolves as well on Wednesday. Not great with the rest of the defense. Dow just got the one and Richards, I think for both of us, um, blanked and, um, really disappointing because that had been the match that I had certainly been looking at for a while and that's why I'd kind of held him. Yeah. And uh then they capitulated in the second half. >> First Bley victory for 17 games or something. >> Yeah. They they were on a terrible run and it looked good at halftime, didn't it? They were two nil up Palace and um >> couldn't believe that when I when I checked the result after. Um >> I mean I think it was there was a a period in that game, wasn't there, where where that happened. >> Um so the only sort of I mean because basically Chris go into Wolves fixture next. >> Yeah. Yeah. So you would hope they don't they rectify that sort of crazy block in that. >> It's very very unlike isn't it to to fall apart to that extent against the Burnley side. They're normally pretty solid. Um >> but I think we've got to keep him for Wolves haven't we? And they've got leads coming up at home soon. So there's um and he's only what 4.4. I can't remember if he's gone up now but he's cheap. So um >> so that was the defense. So yeah, blanks all round there, but hopefully we'll get a bit of a bit of a jump on Wednesday. Um, got Rice on four, he'll go up to five and obviously one match to play. Got Semenya with 14. So he's been great for me recently. Um, I think a lot of people have held off moving for him knowing that City are going to blank in 31, but um, he's been he's been really, um, consistent. >> Um, and I've just held him. I didn't transfer him in. I just had him since he was at Bournemouth and kept him there. Um, Fernandez just got the two at West Ham. Enzo just got the two. That was a bit of a tough watch with Palmer and Pedro Hall in that one. Um, but just got to hope that Burnley next. He'll he'll get some more opportunities to get some points. Um, Harland just got the five, went off at Halime and he's flagged now. >> Mhm. >> Um, so we'll have to keep an eye on that. Ekit just the two and then Strand Larson 13. >> And then on the bench it was just blanks all round. D Bravka one, Mule two, Anderson two, Jaka didn't play. >> Yeah. Um so I mean I think just going for the um a couple of things there. One uh Rya I think is a smart move just for planning as well because you can he he blanks in game 31. So you can just park him and bring Dabra in and hope for the best there. Um so so that's good. So that leaves you with Richards, Semeno, Harland, Gabrielle and Rice. So that does leave you with five >> and Strand Larson. >> And so that leaves you with six blankers there. >> Yeah. >> So you have got to remove three of those essentially by gameweek 31. >> Yeah. >> Um so that's what you're looking at there which is annoying this week because Richardson Strand Lson played Wolves so you're not going to do that. SMA is excellent and Harland if he's fit he's is excellent as well. And Gabrielle's excellent. So >> yeah, I'm going to delay that. I'm going to delay obviously I've got to keep that in mind. I've got the two free transfers as well. Um, and that will it's why I might roll this week because I think that somebody like Strand Larson, who I've only just got in, I think I'd be more comfortable selling him next week rather than ahead of Wolves at home obviously. Um, but yeah, got to keep it in mind. >> Yeah. So, you'll be looking at for gameweek 31 um you'll be you'll be looking to either save transfers ahead of that or gradually move some of those players out. I I myself have Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Har Harland Gabrielle Rice which is just the four. >> Um Rice will go before Gameweek 31 and Richards will go as well around then and I'm quite happy to keep um uh Harland and Gabrielle. The other thing I wanted to mention which is also with Gameweek 31 in mind because you were saying about people not getting Smeno in and that is indeed true because Blanks in gameweek 31 and they've already missed lots of points myself included >> uh which you've got. Um and they're going to continue to miss points I think because Simemeno is being greedy and previously we've only really had one greedy bloke Harland at Man City and now we've got two but not just greedy can score. Um so I mean yeah I mean even against um oh there was um a moment in the uh who are they playing Sulford wasn't it in the um >> I know it was Sulford but there was a particular moment where s I just suddenly I turned it on or something and I just saw Smeno just making this move and bit of bit of a pass and then he just I mean he hit the post in the end but the fact is he just was suddenly in that scoring position and I know it was just Salford but that was just Just a little reminder that that's what he's about. >> Yeah. >> For for those I was going to say for those like me um who are unlucky enough not to own him. >> If I I could get him in. I don't mind getting him in because I've only got the four >> and but and it would have to be for Rice and I would still have four then. And so I can still happily go through game 31. So if Harland is out, I was thinking not actually removing Harland um of actually just getting Rice for Smen and then see how Harland is for the the following week. >> Yeah, because I I guess that people are obviously looking at gameweek 31 and they want a full team to put out obviously, but there's a lot of points to play for before then. I think we've been this we're through every season we get blind to certain players because they blank in a few weeks time. But >> look at those fixtures for City. They've got Newcastle at home and Newcastle side who go to Carabag >> before the match and have another Champions League match on Tuesday. It's a tight turnaround. >> Then you got Leads away, Forest home, West Ham away. Now, you know, Semeno could get a couple of double digit balls in those four matches, couldn't they? >> Definitely. >> Um, >> so yeah, I think if I didn't own him, I would still be tempted, provided you can kind of work it into a plan where you're not going to be taking a stupid amount of hits further down the line. Um but yeah, he looks good. Um obviously this week. So um yeah, and if Harland's out as well, like you say, Joe, then suddenly he's probably a captaincy contender, I think. Um >> yeah, >> because there isn't loads of alternatives, I think, this week. >> No. So I mean my So I Yeah, I think we Yeah. need to talk about if if Harland is out and the >> So I suspect he's not because it seemed to be a really small problem. it was inevitable that he was going to be miss um >> the FA Cup game against Salford but if he is out and it's just like oh he's not quite ready but it's the indication is that he's going to be back the following week as I said um I would like to just park him on the bench bring Rice Semeno in for Rice done and then captain Semeno but if it looks like Harland if it's looking one of those ones where it could be for oh he's out for a month then he's he's got to go in a Yeah. >> And the immediate transfer I would want to do would be Salah because I think Salah's looking good form at the moment and is a captaincy contender. So what I would do personally, I don't know about you, but I would move Harland down to J Pedro or Stratton Lson you've already got, but and then I would captain Pedro who has got that Burnley fixture and then I would have enough money to upgrade Rice to Salah the following week. Um >> yeah, I've seen few people mention that because suddenly you've got all of these funds free. Um Salah looked good against Brighton at the weekend. He hasn't been great. >> No, >> since he came back from AFCON, but he seems to be building match fitness. He's more secure in his role. >> Um I mean I don't think I think the thing with Harland though, if he was to miss this week, I don't think he's going to be ruled out for a period of time unless he is a setback. So then you're faced with that decision. Whereas if I were to sell Harland this week, I'm not getting him back for Leads Forest and West Ham given that he blanks. It's probably a see you later till a wild card kind of thing in 32. >> I don't know how comfortable I feel doing that. I might be tempted to try and maybe upgrade Jha or something like that and then bench Harland like you mentioned you might do Joe and and potentially do that. Um I mean the Liverpool fixtures they are good though. I mean, I don't think Forest will be >> no >> a walkover because they've got Pereira in now, haven't they? Maybe a little bit of a new manager bounce, but it's what it's after that. It's West Ham at home, Wolves away, Tottenham at home. >> Yeah, that's why I don't think Liverpool Liverpool, you know, are nice to have against Ningan Forest, but it's the following week where they were like, \"Oh, I really want them.\" Um, and Harland as well price-wise. So, for me, Harland is I got him at 14.2 million. >> He's currently 14.9. So I can sell him for 14.5. That's if So he's not someone I want to I want to remove because I want want back. >> I'm the same as you. Yeah. Yeah. Um exactly. And um I mean it would mean that I could get Eagle Thiago and you mentioned Pedro there. I don't know Thiago and we're going to talk about Brenford in a bit but that he's obviously a player which I do need to make space for but >> I don't think it would be >> in replacing Harland. I think it will be with him. >> Um, one intriguing just we'll get to your team reveal in a second, but it's just your your team is sort of throwing up lots of things um about sort of forward planning as well and looking at the fixtures with Harland. So I obviously if Harland's absolutely fine, great because he's got um you know a whole bunch of great fixtures coming up. So he's got that Newcastle against home game. He's he's away to leads. Um and then gaming 29, Nottingham Forest at home, big captaincy contender there. Um and then looking through then got West Ham away game 30. Brilliant. So I don't want to be removing him for those if he's playing >> but game 31 he doesn't play game and then and then this is going to be intriguing for those like you you and me who haven't played their wild card yet. Game 32 has been earmarked for that to set us up for the doubles and things. But then Man City have Chelsea away and then they've got Arsenal at home and then game 34 Burnley away gets better but also there will be Champions League I presume around then. And if you're going to if you're going to rest a player for an easy match it's going to be that one. Gameweek 35 away to Everton. So they they they start getting a bit better the fixtures, but at the same time on a wild card we could be faced with that decision. Do we get Harland back in? >> Yeah, I think the key will be if they double. Exactly. I think I think if they double, don't they Joe, in 33, >> we're all going to we're all going to get him in because it has the potential to undo a very good bench boost if he hauls and you don't have him. >> But if they don't, then I completely agree. I think there'll be a big decision there. I think a lot of us who wild card in 32 will be wanting a lot of doublers. >> Yeah, >> potentially even 15. Um depending on how many teams the draw actually looked quite promising >> last night in terms of getting a good amount of doubles. Um but we still don't know for sure. No. >> So um we'll see. Um but I think yeah, I'm going to want to pack out my team for that. But again, we've got to kind of think, you know, don't want to neglect the weeks after either. So um it's going to be quite yeah quite a lot of thought go into that where so you're not just you know it's not just a twoe wild card this has got to see you through till we're probably going to free hit in 34 I think aren't we if we wild card 32 >> and then so it's 35 to 38 you got to think about >> yeah definitely I've got to do I'm doing a wild card video this week by the way um and that'll be out on uh Wednesday night I think or maybe Thursday morning um which will look um so obviously I'm not wild carding this week. So, it's quite intriguing looking at what I would do and >> um a lot of what you have to because it's quite a tricky week because Palmer's a great captaincy this week, but yeah, I don't really want him after that and and and so on. So, and you got to plan plan for it and plan for the what people are going to be doing in gamewick 32 and that's difficult because we don't know who's quite going to double yet. >> Very hard. So, so one of one of the key things, a spoiler there, it's one of the key things is build up transfers because you don't know what you're going to do in gamewick 33 and 34. >> Chelsea is Chelsea is really tricky, isn't it? Because um great fixture now then it's a pretty I think it's a tougher run. They go to Arsenal as well, don't they? And what is it? Villa, Newcastle, We Yeah. So, it's that's the really difficult part. Um I think like you say build the transfers up and then you can maybe feel a bit more confidence going for Palmer knowing that if you need to you can get him out after although although I don't think Palmer ever is going to be a priority sale um because he's um you know some people might even think well I'm happy to keep him for that period and fair enough if you do it's just for people who are going to buy him now I'm not sure it might be different. >> Yeah. Okay. Let's finally after all of that um we'll look at your team reveal. >> Yeah. So, do you want to take us through your team, who you potentially captain, and also who you might captain? >> Um, because the deadline's 130, 1:15 on Saturday. So, >> yeah. Yeah. >> What's going to go through your mind if you get the news that Harland is out for a week or it's a bit dubious? >> Yeah. So, I've got, you can see I've got two free transfers. I've got 0.5 in the bank. Um so the team I've got Ryer in goal ga uh in in the north London derby and Gabrielle as well. Um and then Muko and Richards who got decent decent home fixtures. So that feels fairly good this week. Um then I've got Rice Semeno Enzo and Bruno Fernandez in midfield. >> Harland captain Eatik and Strand Larson up front and then Dravaranderson Dalow and Jaca who is still flagged. um on the bench. So, I think the likely plan is to roll. I did a few days ago I was looking at Rice potentially going out and um we'll come on to it a bit, but I was looking at Danoara as a potential replacement. I haven't completely ruled that out. But I think Rice in this kind of North London derby fixture. I think it feels like he's probably got a four-point >> base to work from because he'll probably get Defcon in that game. And um it might be like a set piece deciding that kind of fixture. You know, I think going to have Tudor and aren't they um Tottenham. So they might put up a bit more of a fight than they would have done a couple of weeks ago. But that that was the kind of move I was eyeing up. and then potentially bringing Thiago in for Strand Larsson the following week >> rather than this week. Um >> so if Harland's fit, absolutely great. He's my captain. >> Um >> if he isn't, I've got the vice on Fernandez, but I think I'd be tempted by Smeno. Um >> I would I would definitely >> yeah in that situation because I do think Newcastle going to Carabag playing Wednesday having to travel back couple of thousand miles however much it is then having the second leg on Tuesday. Um I mean Newcastle they I watched them on Saturday at Villa Park and I thought they >> they were it was pretty even before the red car but they looked organized. They, you know, they're a good team, Newcastle for sure, but it's just that that Champions League factor which makes me think City at home, you know, that Brenford result for Arsenal, it's given them um a little bit more of a chance in the title race. And I think that they'll be they'll be there'll be goals, at least a couple of goals for them in that match. So, yeah, I'll be tempted by Semeno over Fernandez. Um I don't mind Fernandez at Everton, but um I just I think the home player Yeah. against Newcastle could be the way to go. Yeah, definitely. As I said, that's pretty much what I would do if if it looked like Harlem's out for a week or so. I would swap I would actually swap Rice for Smeno for me to get him in because I do think he would be good. I do I think Palmer and J Pedro are very good. Very very well Palmer's probably the best captain this week and J Pedro are very good as well. But it's it's it's a question of do I want them the following weeks? And as I said, if Harland's out for a long time, I think yeah, Harland to Pedro is fine because then that s suddenly you can upgrade Rice to Salad in time for Liverpool's really good fixtures, which I >> Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I think I mentioned before I might if Harlem was out, I might have to upgrade Jaka, but I don't I think my bench feels okay. I don't mind playing Anderson at Sunderland this week. So I think I think in whatever event what's happened, I think it's a role this week. It builds me up to free transfers, blank game week 31. I can start thinking about then moves when to take players out and to to make sure I get 11 out in that in that week and then wild card after that. >> Yeah, I mean Dowo as well. I mean we so you know blank this week 12 points the week before. So you know he's away to Everton. Anything could go there. Um >> yeah, that was the match I was worried about against Spurs, I think. And I think you said no, that's an okay fixture and I'm glad I listened cuz he came out with a big haul. >> Yeah, it did. Um and yeah, so Dallas exactly the same place on my bench as well. >> Um so um uh yeah uh because you've got I've got very very similar. Yeah, I've got Alderi though. So you'll get you'll get four points more than me with Maley. >> I think Alderetti he didn't play in the FA Cup, did he? >> Because he came off against Liverpool, but I think I think the suggestions were he was going to be okay. Yeah. So um maybe it's his turn to get the points over Mule. It can't go on forever. >> Maybe maybe one day. I can dream. Um let's I've just have a look at the fixtures because we've been talking about them a lot and we've included gaming 31 here and it's quite good to just show that so we can map that out. Um whatever people are trying to do with their their transfers as well. This shows that from now until gaming 31. The reason we're doing gaming 31 is that gaming 32 is a bit up in the air because a lot of that transfers and wild cards are going to be based on who's doubling. So then you might bench boost or triple captain in game 33 and then you might free hit in game 34. So it's it's impossible to really judge the fixtures. So we're do we're doing up to what we know. Bournemouth are top. They've got West Ham, Sunderland, Brenford, Burnley, Manchester United. Can't see a lot of clean sheets. Doesn't matter with Hill. Um but also looks good for Rayan um and Evan Nilson and all their attackers. Fulham are good as well actually. Sunderland, Tottenham, West Ham, Nottingham Forest, Burnley. So Wilson could be returning to Bournem over this period. Um the likes of Anderson. So I might I might get Anderson at some point. um because he's quite handy. Uh Man City's really good fixtures. That's why uh we were talking about Simeia a bit and and make and making sure we know what we're doing with Harland. Newcastle leads Nottingham Forest at home, West Ham away, and then they blank in 31 as we said. Liverpool, they got Nottingham Forest away. Not sure how that's going to go with the new manager, but West Ham at home, Wolves away, Tottenham at home, Brighton away. That is really good, especially from the attacking point of view, and I do not look forward to that as a Brighton fan. Um Aston Villa leads at home this week. So I've got Rogers. So um happy happy days for my two points that one, but hope hopefully he'll get he'll get one of his 12 pointers. Uh and then Wolves away. Great. So great couple of fixtures for a Villa. Then Chelsea Manchester United. Okay. Then West Ham at home. So Villa worth investment. Brenford, we'll talk about them in a second a bit more detail. Brenford, they got Brighton at home. Brilliant. Burnley away. Brilliant. Bournemouth away. Brilliant. Wolves at home. Brilliant. Leads away. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant, brilliant. Um, Crystal Palace, they got that Wolves game, but then they got Manchester United, Tottenham, and then Leads and then a blank. So, um, meanwhile, um, looking down at Chelsea, brilliant. Burnley, and then it just drops off a cliff. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle might be okay. Then Everton away. Uh, Manchester United, they got mixed fixtures, but still okay. Everton away. Crystal Palace at home could be okay. Newcastle away. Aston Villa at home. Bournemouth away. So, a lot of hard to call games there, but I'm quite happy to keep hold of Bruno Fernandez and Dalow as a bench option or or maybe field him for some of those. So, um yeah, some it's a different set of fixtures. It's not pre four or five weeks ago it was get Chelsea, get Chelsea. Now it's like Chelsea got one more good game left. >> Yeah, it's it's coming towards the end of that run, isn't it? It's not to say Palmer can't do well, but yeah. Yeah, Bournemouth fixtures look very good as you said and I do like Liverpool from 28. >> I'm kind of thinking could I complement Ekit with a Vert or a Van Djk or I think KZA has been playing well recently as well. >> My my hope is that Harland is fine and I am going to save a transfer then next week what I would really really like to do is Enzo and Rice out for Vertz and Dango and that that will be me. So speaking of Dango, um let's have a look at some Brenford players. >> So I've got the last six game weeks. I've excluded anyone who hasn't got a return over this period. Um obviously the goalkeeper. So this is outfield players. So Shardai is back from his ban. He's top in terms of minutes per expected goal involvement on penalty. Uh just from four starts because he has been banned um for two games and one in the FA Cup. But he's had 10 shots, three on target um created six chances. Just that one assist though and just seven points and he's hardly in any teams. Dango is next. A a mammoth 23 points six last six game weeks. Minutes per expected goal involvement non penalty every 151 minutes. Still pretty good. Seven shots and creates six chances as well. Thiago is probably the stand out. He's got three goals. Dango's got three returns by the way, two goals and assist. D Thiago is probably the the key one here for three goals doing exactly what a striker should. 25 points uh the most on this. Um created five chances, 17 shots, eight on target and strong expected goal involvement non-penalty as well. And he's on penalties. Um Jensen is worth a mention at 4.9. He's got two assists so far and 19 points. Not too shabby. Lewis Potter, it remains to be seen whether he'll stay in the side of Shard. So Sharda you would expect would come in, but he has had 18 points. Um and then there's a few others like Yamaluk, Yanau, uh Vanderberg and Collins who has been in your side. He was amazing for you last season but has suddenly sort of found himself dropped. Um yeah, it's just the three starts. So in terms of a defender um well two things here, what do you think about the attackers and also the second thing if you can remember after you talked about the attackers, defenders? Which defender to get in? >> Well, well, I'll do the defenders first because that kind of links to the attackers point a little bit. So yeah, Collins has been benched. He picked up a bit of a knock. Um, so it's been Vandenberg and Christopher Azier who's been playing the past few games. >> Um, and Keith Andrews, I think a lot of Brenford fans will know that he likes to keep a winning team. So if a player drops out, be it through injury or suspension, if the team is performing well, it's players have found it quite tough to come back in. It also happened with damage guard as well. Yensen has been playing in that number 10 role instead and he hasn't been able to get back in just yet. >> That makes me a bit concerned about Sharda. Will he come straight back in for Lewis Potter given that Lewis Potter has just scored against Arsenal? They've got a good result against them. >> Not totally sure. Um, so at the back I probably wouldn't touch any of the center backs. I'd probably go for Kod, I think, if I wanted one, who's um, obviously got these kind of long throws in his >> Arsenal and he's pretty he's pretty effective at them. He's a player I like. So that's probably Orala of course in goal. >> Really good goalkeeper pick. >> Um, I think I think Thiago's the number one pick further forward, isn't he? Obviously he's on penalties. He's the main man there. Um, if you want to add an extra in, I think I'd probably be be tempted by Dango over Shard just because of that little bit uncertainty. Plus, Dango, he's cheaper. >> Um, he's back in the side after an AFCON. He I think he takes a few corners. His big chance involvement is um really high for midfielders. I think it's something like only behind Palmer up 90 over the season, which is ridiculous really. um he's won a lot of penalties for Thiago, cheaper. You know, what is he like 5.8 million compared to 6.9. So that's a big difference. >> So I think if I was going to go for somebody as well as Thiago, it would be Dango, I think. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think that's where I would look as well. And just remind me actually that my current vice captain is Thiago, home to Brighton. So in what I might do if I was um you know minded to if I found that Harlem was out I would just just keep it because then Harlem wouldn't play um Anderson from Notting Forest would come in against Liverpool and Thiago would be my captain. So I'd probably >> Would you feel happy? Would you be okay with that against Brighton Jay? >> Well as a Brighton fan. No >> no I didn't mean it like that. I just meant as looking at their defense. Um, no, I remember the last game that was when Brighton were quite good as well and he he almost got a me massive ball. He still got points against Brighton. >> Yeah, Brighton are really bad at the moment. I mean, >> yeah, I mean last Wednesday I was at the game and um I thought defensively you're okay, but you didn't offer anything in attack at all really and we weren't great either to be fair. A draw was probably a fair result, but it was just that they were secure defensively because they didn't really get many bodies forward or anything or put any pressure. >> It's got I mean that you know MANA on the wings but Mas can't get in the side. Um and then you got Wellbeck up front >> and Castulas is is fine but you would expect more from that >> es especially with a good midfield. um you know the defense >> defense you expect more you expect more from all of that and so I I have to come to conclusion I think it is the manager there because I don't think I don't think the players are a problem >> um I I think um I think there's a problem with selection when a 17-year-old from Worthing >> gets in ahead of like the likes of Ma and I mean I mean I know Milner came on but you know I I still prefer that I still prefer the a wy old Milner for half an in the derby. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, know it was a bit underwhelming last week in terms of the attack, but >> yeah, obviously Brenford are really good at home as well, aren't they? They score a lot of goals. So, yeah, I was kind of thinking I don't necessarily have to go for a Brenford player this week, but >> yeah, maybe. Yeah, it is it is a decentish fixture for them. So, um I don't think I will have anybody. I've just got to hope that Brighton can kind of keep it down to a low scoring kind of 1 nil or something like that. I mean, from an FPL point of view, I hope Thiago annihilates them, but from a Brighton fan point of view, um I I hope that that's probably our best hope, a nil nil. >> Yeah. Yeah, it feels like you were set up to play like that at Villa and um and it almost worked. >> Um just before we go, um I do want to flag up a few things.

Uh and one that caught my eye this week is exactly what we were talking about Brenford and it was an article by our colleague Mark um Sharda Vango. Um and it was a very illuminating one looking at the stats. Sharda sort of wins out on a lot of the stats apart from the key one. Um which is points. Um and Dan goes goal involvement. So in terms of goal FPL goal involvement, Shard's involved when he's on the pitch in a third, but he's getting 48% nearly half for Dango. And that's because he's winning a lot of those penalties. He's really creative on corners. Um so in terms of expected goals um minutes per expected goals every 214 minutes for Sharda, every 291 minutes for Dango. Um and uh uh yeah in terms of um um looking at minutes per expected goal involvement, not just expected goals, minutes per expected goal involvement every 178 minutes for for Sharda, 224 minutes for Dango. So if you just look at the stats, Sharda is the one. But then you look at the other things. Dan goes a million cheaper. Dan goes well he's on one less point but for less less time because he went to AFCON. Um sorry one more point but with less time because he went to Afcon. >> Yeah. >> So everything points to Dango I think really. But I don't think Shard is too bad. But will he get back in the side? There's too many question marks and >> yeah bit of uncertainty which isn't ideal is it? Um, so I think if you're going to make a move this week, I'd feel a bit more comfortable with Dango, I think. >> Yeah. So, that article's fantasy football scout. Have a look at it. It'll be on the homepage somewhere. Um, and whenever you watch and listen to that and do have a look at that in the other articles as well. Um, okay, Tom, thanks a lot for your time. Um, good luck to both of us for our Arsenal triple up and triple captaincy. Um, let's hope um Gabrielle's no Shane Duffy and um and then we'll be back next week to look ahead to Gaming 28. >> Great. Thanks, Joe. >> See you soon."

      "transcript": "Hello everyone. Welcome back to another stream on Fantasy Football Scout. Today I'm joined by Chris and we're going to run through my gameweek 26 uh total score so far. We'll take a look at some of my uh transfer plans and team selection for gameweek 27. Chris, how are we keeping? >> Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right. Fantasywise, a little bit of a red at the moment, but obviously we're only uh we're not quite through the game week. We're waiting for that beautiful clean sheet for Arsenal to come in and make all our lives better or not. Uh as as we shall see. But yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right. I kind of trying to still my mission to to to have not my worst fantasy season ever. So, I've got to get within the top million for that. And uh hopefully that will turn into a Green Arrow by the time this game weeks over. But then we need to look at what's happened next. I've got no idea what to do next. So, I'm going to be fascinated to see what you're doing. But yeah, how you doing? How's your points this week so far? How your points? >> So, we'll bring that up in just a second. Um, but yeah, in general, I think this week has been, you know, a poor one overall for many. Um, I don't think it's the highest scoring game week. Again, it is a double game week, so a lot of people still have three or four players to play. And for those who went with um, you know, a Wolves asset, um, you know, you've done fairly well if you went with a Jose Saw or a midfielder. So, fair play if you've gone there. Uh, I currently have four left to play and I activated my bench boost last game week or this game week. Uh, and I'm not happy with the bench boost, but I'm not overly disappointed yet. Uh, because many people have activated triple captain. And I'm I'm hoping that my poor bench boost can be combed by a poor triple captain by others and that I can suddenly or hopefully gain points later down the line and hopefully bench boost doesn't kill me uh later down the line as well. So, what did you So, Gone, what did you go with? Let's Let's Let's look at So, what did you go with with your bench boost in the end? Who Who did you end up with? Because I know we were debating it last time. I was saying not to do it, and you did it anyway. [laughter] >> So, my bench boost was the Bravka, Enzo Fernandez, Sessi, and Krooppy Jr. Let me quickly run through the team for anyone who is listening. I'm currently >> sitting on 43 points. On goal, we got Sanchez, a fourback with Daniel Mos, the transfer this gameweek. Gabrielle with the captaincy band, Timber and Shalova. Four in midfield with Fernandez, Indie, Rogers and Roy, and then two up top with Manet and Holland. So very very disappointing gameweek so far for my own team. The most disappointing thing for me is the bench of course and for me I feel like um you know it was good enough to play. Um the reason I played it was because I wanted to bring in Danny Mowz and he was just terribly disappointed even though he picked up some great numbers. though didn't turn out with the result I wanted. Ilman and DI coming up with the goods in my own team. Probably the only shining light. Nice penalty by him of course, but you know, a few disappointing assets in there. Like I said, Mino is clocking very very high numbers and um for Crystal Palace to concede so so many. I know they're in, you know, a hard place right now, but even at that, I didn't expect him to be so bad. Shalaban Sanchez again losing their clean sheet. Shallow coming up with a late cle point. Gabrielle Chris the biggest talking point of the game week picking up a yellow card. It should have been red. >> Could have been that would have been but there was some dispute about what would happen if that would he have missed the cup game or whether he would have missed I don't know there was some dispute about what game would be missed there. Whether he'd be back or not but yeah it was very lucky. He was a very lucky boy. Uh and we were very lucky as as owners. Um but yeah I'm on I'm on the triple captain strategy as I said I was going with and I'm I'm on that. Uh, so I guess we're we're the buying strategies, but yeah, it's going to need a clean sheet, preferably a goal as well for it to really kind of come off. Um, because at the moment it doesn't look great. Um, to be honest, all it needs is one goal from uh from Wolves one and and and the whole triple captain thing is is is is down the Swany. You've obviously got him captain anyways. That's obviously bad for you two and uh Timber. So you you're in a difficult position now. Are you kind of are you hoping now that that Gabrielle doesn't doesn't get a clean sheet um because of the you know the number of people in triple captains? How you how are you feeling about that? >> Oh yeah, absolutely. In my heart heart of hearts I'll always hope that Arsenal concede even if I own them. So it's a win-win for me. They return I get some sort of caveat. Arsenal concede then hopefully they drop some points towards the league. Um I don't think they're necessarily going to drop points versus Wolves but who knows. Brenford were brilliant and Arsenal were very poor versus um you know as good as Brenford have been this season. You know you still expect Arsenal to put up um you know good performance but Brenford doing really well with Keith Andrews in fairness and a lot of chances generated uh in that game which I thought be very interesting and going into this um Arsenal game you know I would mind a man goal I'd be more than happy with it. Yeah. No. Well, I got a man as well, so I'd be kind of I don't know. I I need the triple captains to come off really. I I need just But but I don't know how many how many triple captains quite a lot went from the more engaged managers. I was quite surprised because everybody was kind of poo pooing it and then come deadline everyone seems to be on it. So, a lot of people obviously you went a different route but and you were I I think you've had a bad beat there. I think it's tough. You know, uh Fernandez Enzo is doing exactly what he did last time I brought him in. He's just looking like he should be getting points and he's just not getting them right. And um so yeah, and then Chalaba and Sanchez, I don't know. I I Sanchez is the Chelsea defense is not something I'm enjoying at the moment. Hopefully this week is going to be better coming into which we'll talk about in a minute. But yeah, you've you've had some tough luck there. And obviously you've got the wrong you've got the wrong Bournemouth defender. >> I've got Hill for two weeks, sat on my bench for two weeks. giving massive returns for two weeks uh and and not getting in my side. So, had you got a hill, that bench looks a hell of a lot better, right? >> Yeah, he seems to be taking away even the the defcon from Snessi as well and the XGI. So, very frustrating, I have to say. And I'm paying a, you know, a 0.9 more than what Hill is worth, which is even more frustrating. Crippy Jr. who did who didn't start the game versus Everton, which to be honest, I did not expect. A lot of people actually had him starting in their, you know, their starting 11 who weren't on bench boost. So, poor uh enough game week and poor use of chip by myself. But you know what? Uh and I think given the strategy that I'm on, I do not regret it at all. H looking forward now what this has done for me is now I don't need to use transfers setting up a you know a halfman bench boost later down the line whether it's gameweek 33 or whenever it is. then I can use those transfers to make sure that my starting 11 is where it needs to be. And because I've used my wild card early, I think that's particularly important given that I have less transfers to mess around with. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How many how many transfers you got in your in your your back pocket at the moment? How many have you gotten? >> Um I've got two free transfers. Um and that is only because Declan Rice had to come in for Baio Saka, which wasn't ideal. >> I know that was tough. I'm sat on five and they're burning a hole. I've got to use got to use some this week and they're burning a hole in my pocket at the moment. We'll talk about what we're doing next. Before we go on, can I just say I'm with you on Moon. I brought Munos in the week before. It's just I don't know why because I don't really believe in Palace at the moment. I think Palace I think Palace could be the surprise drop this year. I think they're just heading one way at the moment. They just don't obviously lost players. I mean, Strand Lson was a good signing and and and they brought a few others in, but managers going, they've lost some of their talismen. They just don't look at it, right? They can, you know, and I I could see them, you know, they're they're a little bit clear at the moment, but I could see them dropping down into that danger area really easily. And and yeah, so Munos obviously, as you say, the numbers are good. Um the uh the goal involvement numbers look good, but yeah, we're not getting clean sheets there. I was even considering moving him on before Wolves, but I've been argued out of it so far. So, I guess I guess he gets one more one more game reprieve before I move him. But yeah, [snorts] but yeah, tough. It's tough because we we were hoping for I had big hopes for Munos as well. I thought that was going to be a nice differential. Just hasn't just hasn't proved that way. >> Before we move on, Chris, you are one of those managers who have hit the triple captain button. >> At a minimum, what would Gabrielle have to get for you to be satisfied now that he's gone and blanked in [snorts] that first game? I mean, I it it's got to be it's got to be an eight pointer. I'm thinking it's got to be, you know, the clean sheet uh and and and the appearance points and and and the defcons for me. I anything less than eight, maybe I'll get a yellow card, so maybe it'll be seven, but like anything less than that is is going to be a massive disappointment. Um, be lovely to get a goal and some defcons, some bonus points as well, but I just want clean sheet bonus. Boom. That's what I bought him for. That was the whole point. Obviously, the gold threats there as well. So, if he doesn't get that, I'll be uh I'll be uh I'll be very, very disappointed. Um, yeah, sitting there sitting there with a with a three-pointer, a treble to nine is not is not feeling like the best use of the uh of the triple captive. Mind you, I did use a previous one on Holland when he got like a one pointer, I think, which was absolute disaster. So, it's it's improved upon that. But yeah, but yeah. No, and I can see where you're going. Like, you've got you've had a bad bench boost. It's tough, right? But, you know, if if if Gabrielle concedes, then you know, like you say, maybe the damage is is going to be minimal. It's it's not it's going to be small small damage done. But yeah, I I I want eight points and that will take him to 11 33. Not could be bad, could be, you know, could be better. But that's what I want. I mean, I can you see Wolves scoring. The thing is Wolves I I can see Wolves could score. I think Wolves could score there. I think they're going to I think it's going to be a lowscoring game. I don't certainly see it being a being a you know, highscoring game, but um yeah, obviously any team can score against any team in the Premier League, right? So >> I don't know. And last time around Arsenal dominated Wolves and they scored in the last minute. Exactly. Yeah. So, you never know what's going to happen in this sort of game, especially away and they're fighting for their lives and they do seem to have picked it up a small bit. But let's move on from gameweek 26. Chris, before we get on to gameweek 27, let's talk about Tottenham. New manager. >> What's happening at Tottenham? Has anything happened at Tottenham, Charlie? >> Yeah, there's there's movements being made and you know what? Um, I feel like it's a a burden lift lifted off my shoulder after all these weeks. I mean, for anyone who's been here for a while, you would know where I stand with Thomas Frank. I was always of the impression that given him as much time as necessary. Now, I do agree with the sacking completely by how things have gone. Um, you know, the atmosphere around Tottenham is I think the worst it's ever been if I'm being completely honest. And when it gets to a point where it does not seem recover recoverable, for example, our manager drinking out of coffee cups from our rival team, for example, or saying things, wasn't it? That the PR the PR should be sacked for that. Like someone else should be sacked for that. That happened. That's mad. >> And um also just the football being absolutely nowhere near and never mind the football the results also. So Igor Toador is in. I think it is it is an interesting interim appointment and to be honest I have no issues with it personally. Um I don't think he will be the man for the job in the summer. I think I'd be hoping for a Pochettino. I think that return does look likely after the World Cup. But what can we expect from Tottenham and Igor then? >> I don't know what I mean he's he's neither someone that likes uh likes his uh his wing backs. Is that him? I'm not I'm not I'm not massively massively up to date on on on Eigor. I love they've kind of moved from kind of I said it's a it's a monster season. You move from Frankenstein to to Eigor. This is your uh season. But yeah, what what are you expecting from him? You must be doing your homework bit more than me. You must be looking. What we're expecting is him to come in and apparently he's a very um emotional and um strict manager and we'll make sure the players are, you know, not faffing about, which I feel like we had a bit of. You know, whether it was social media, um you know, I feel like he could be the type to come in and tell the lads, you know, no ketchup. Um no, you're not allowed to wear snusses no matter how cold it is, no gloves, that type of stuff. And they'll put him straight. But yeah, five at the back with wing backs is what he plays. and um you know it is a bit more pragmatic I think it's fair to say. I've heard a few UA fans speak about him. Um he's had two interim jobs since and done very well in the 12 game games he's been appointed for. Got UVA Champions League um and then got the permanent job but it didn't quite go his way after not winning the game in eight I believe it was. So for Tottenham I think is definitely good. I feel like the team just needs something new. uh you know when you go from such a big motivational speaker like an straight to Thomas Frank where I feel like he didn't have the respect of the dressing room and going back to someone who can get you can get behind and is quite motivational but only worry would be h going into what looks to be a relegation fight. What's crazy is after one game this could you know no longer be a relegation fight but it is in in the current circumstances and also given the fact that we have Arsenal at home next which is an absolutely massive game and I think this is you know a perfect appointment for a game like this I mean they'll the fact the players will have to get behind him no matter who the manager is and I think this couldn't be a better game for him to come in and yeah >> I think it's going to be interesting how we're going to set up like I think >> yeah well I I think I think you need I mean if you're going to make a This is a game. It's a bit of a a shot to nothing, right? Um so, um yeah, uh you know, um I I think it's a bit of a shot to nothing. So, I'm answering some questions chat, but I I I I do um I think as you're right, if you you know, bring him in for that big game, get the mentality right, you're going to have to really go at at that and be organized. That's a game. But it's true, you if if if Spurs, you know, if it goes to form, Spurs lose that game. If West Ham are looking a lot better at the moment, if West Ham West Ham beat Bournemouth at home, which is not an easy game at all by any means, but but if they, you know, if they do, they've already won three of the last uh six uh drawn one. Um then it's a two-point gap, you know, and um and at the moment it's it's Spurs and and Forest. If West Ham do pick up, it's Spurs and Forest that are the teams looking most there. I mentioned Palace earlier. They're a little way clearer. They're three points above Spurs, but I just don't think they look very good at the moment. So, you know, I think they could easily drop in as well. And look at Brighton. Brighton have not won a game in six either. Like it's I think it's much longer than that actually. I think Brighton have bit been a bit of free fall. So, there's always a team or teams that get sucked in like late on. Happens every year. I think we're all expecting Burnley and Wolves are gone, right? So I know you say Wills have fired their lives, but I you know I I think Wills are planning for the championship. Burnley pretty much the same despite their their victory, but yeah, you know, after that it's it's won from from three or four teams. I think it's usually Everton, so I'm usually I'm used to being down there. I know exactly what it's like, but but for once we're not we're not as it stands in that in that position. But I think Okay, I think Spurs will probably do I think Forest maybe could be. What do you think about Forest? Because I've obviously change manager as well and the change manager from the guy that people bring in to battle relegation scraps. Um what do you think about that? Does that make you feel better? The the the forest change? >> I think Forest is just a complete mess. Again, it comes from the owner. Um interesting enough, I actually saw him when I was over in uh in London. He was at the hotel I was staying at and he was getting a coffee. Oh wow. >> Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] Mr. Marinus. But yeah. No, Forest is a mess. >> Did you ask do you make suggestions about changing manager? Did you say you should take on Thomas? He' probably give me a left hook if I went up to him [laughter] and he sacked Cogley. So I have a bit of hatred going towards him. But anyway, um Forest is a mess in my opinion. And again, I think they will be fighting of course. Again, when you sack someone like Shawn D, that's never a good look. Someone who, like you said, is the manager you bring in. So, let's see how that go. >> He's only lost one in the last six as well. Like the I mean, fair enough. He's lost some important games and he's not he's only got two wins in six, but he's got two wins, three draws in six. Like, that's not that's, you know, that's the best performance. I mean, West Ham is is only seen better than that in in that bottom half, I think, is West Ham. Like, so fair enough that it's not going the right direction. I've had a couple of dicey results, but overall, Dai's form isn't bad. It was it was but yeah, the guy is impetuous, but yeah. Yeah, I I think that's kind of in your favor to be honest because I think Dice is exactly the manager that can grind out results when he needs to and and I don't know if if Pereira is going to, you know, I know he did did well with Wolves last year, but I don't know. I don't know if it's going to be the smart move. >> It's going to be It's fun to watch, isn't it? Anyway, >> no, it's not fun to watch. Anyway, let's move on from the relegation battle with my own team. Let's move on to my gameweek 27 team. >> Let's go to 27. That's what we want to talk about. There's loads of questions in the chat about about um players to bring in, whatever. So, look at let's look at 27. Yeah. >> So, looking at my team for gameweek 27, I have 1.4 million in the bank and two free transfers. I got Robert Sanchez on goal. I'm playing a five at the back this gameweek with Manos, Shalaba, Gabrielle, Timber, and Sessi. Four in midfield are Fernandez, India, Enzo, and Rogers. And then up top, we've got Erling Holland, who is a slight slight doubt. H. And on the bench we've got Dravka, Krooppy Jr., Royce, and Manny. First off, Chris, the bench order. Have I got it right? And for me, you know, there there is part of me, of course, being a Spurs fan and seeing how this double game week is going with the new manager bounce and at home fixture. Double up on the Arsenal fence. Would you feel comfortable playing it against Tottenham in their current state? Absolutely. Yes. But how do you feel? >> Uh, I Yeah, I I think there's problems all over this because it looks very similar to my side in a lot of ways as well. So, it's not that's not a criticism. I I I think there's there's issues all over the place. I think you're obviously keeping your you're keeping Chelsea against Burnley, but I'm assuming you're thinking Enzo's on borrowed time. I know this is defense question, but um there he's just not delivering. Um yeah, double double double if you're not wanting to make a transfer, I think that's fine. I I don't think that's a you know, that's a massive a massive problem. Um and you got to despite what I've just said about West Ham, you know, Sessi's got to be in for defcons there and you think they've got a chance of getting a result there as well. Um yeah, I I think I mean one of Spurs' problems is the forward line, right? They don't have they don't you know they have a lot of injuries there. They don't have the first choice kind of forwards in. I know Sanki's back, but they that you know and and the people that have been scoring people like Romero who aren't playing obviously because they're banned. So you Yeah, I think you know I don't see if if Spurs, you know, I don't see Spurs being free scoring. So I think that's a good time to have that Arsenal double up even though you're going to hate it. You've got to hope Munos gives us something and you've got against Wolves, you've got to hope they can keep a clean sheep, but I don't know. Has seen them seen Palace against Burnley? I'm not I'm not so sure about that either. Um but yeah, I I I don't know. I mean, five defenses is is is is interesting. What if you weren't going to go which of those defenders is most prone to if you were going to go with another attacker or midfield, which of those defenders would come out first for you? >> Timber or Sessi? I think it's quite close given that Sessi is, you know, very nailed for for Defcon and Timber, you know, he's he's had great attacking numbers this season. We've said it over and over and over again. He's just not coming out with the points and he's not as good as Defcon and also North London Derby. I mean, you wouldn't be surprised to see a yellow or red, especially with, you know, how up for these player or up these upbeat these players are going to be with the new manager. H I can imagine at home like the atmosphere at Tottenham hasn't been good at all because the results that are going to flip on his head I imagine for this home game in this new stadium with the new manager of course so I imagine you know they will come together so I'm just kind of looking at this game and you know it is probably the nastiest fixture well historically in the league so >> there is part of me that goes >> I think you're fine I think you're fine with playing both of those I think I think Sessi I actually think Sessi of these is the most likely not to keep a clean sheet if I'm honest. Um I do I do I think West Hammer just you know are on a good run at the moment and and will at home will will I think they can score. I think Bournemouth can be scored against. So I I I I think but then maybe he makes some ends the defcons. Um although you know Hill is going to score right again and annoying. >> Yeah, [laughter] everyone but Tessi is going to get defcon and Hill will get a hat-tick. That's just the way it's gone since people have wild card in Halen. Fair play if you have gone. >> What about your midfield then? I I think defense is fine and the bench will ask me but but you've got Fernandez weight ever. Obviously as an Everton fan I don't like the fact you've captured him but fine. Um, and but you obviously played at Nai on the other side. That's interesting. Um, what about Enzo and Rogers? Like Enzo again, home to Burnley. You've got to play him. I get it. I'm gonna be playing him as well, but I think he's he's he's going after this. Um, and there's been Rogers Rogers has gone a little bit off the boil as well recently. Are you are you happy with with with him? Is he a long-term hold again? Home to leads. You've got to hope there's goals there. Um, Villa just got beat in the cup obviously by by Newcastle, but what are you are you happy with that midfield? Is there anybody else you'd want in there? because in the chat there are people talking about other options about the the likes of Vertz of uh of Ryan. I've been looking talking about Smeno as well. Is there anyone else you'd rather have in that midfield what you've what you've got? >> Absolutely. So for me I'm I'm very happy this gameweek to be honest. I have absolutely no complaints with that midfield. You have Fernandez and Di um and Rogers with potential penalties. Enzo Fernandez who might get up for the last 15 minutes if um you know Palmer is rested for the last few if they're leading. So >> that's true >> if you consider the little margins like that and also for me four fantastic fixtures on paper. I mean even though Everton haven't been exactly free flowing in attack I still feel like a man like Elimin big game good for defcon he's uh you know he works really hard um only 6.2 million. Enzo is an iron, right? I think you're right there. But in in another um time and un universe if buts and may, but he would have the those penalties that Palmer has had and we'd be talking about him as like one of the best. >> Yeah. I mean, if if Palmer had still been in and out, you know, it's amazing, isn't it? I I if id known Palmer was going to play as he has been, then, you know, obviously if I knew his score, I brought him in. But yeah, it would have been something I'd looked at more more closely. I just didn't think he's reliable for minutes um at all. But you know, but he's he's doing the business at the moment. He's doing the Palmer business, right? So, okay. So, you're happy in the midfield. What what do you think about people in their chat are asking about transfer? So, what from a midfield perspective, what do you think about about verts this coming in? If Liverpool got good fixtures coming up, a lot of people are talking about Ryan as I say at Bournemouth. Is that is he at all on your radar? >> So, Raj in chat is asking me about Halen as you know. Um in that infamous season where we went without Halen. when I was at my best, but he wasn't involved once again in that City team in the cup. Um, and you know, there are slight doubts and we've not got any concrete updates since, to be honest. And one man that has h played his socks off yesterday, Chris, I don't know if you were keeping tabs on it, but Liverpool played Brighton yesterday and Mosala had the game of his life. He had >> Kadiagloo on strings all game >> and won his penalty and scored. Um, [laughter] if you're asking me something I'd absolutely love to do and the reason I'd love to do it is because one, it g it gains me two fixtures for gamewick 31. >> H it gives me another captaincy option. And third league allows me to bring someone who's out of form uh who has a potential knock either way out of the team. H and that is bringing in MoSalah for Royce and bringing Ekit in for Halen. Now that is absolutely absurd. Uh >> I can see you're doing this. I know what you're like. This is done. Basically you're you're in your heads. You've got this. I can see it's ticking around. I know what you're like in for a week. I love I actually love it. I I I mean Echitique has been trolled me totally. I had him for five games. He got five points. across those five games. Soon as I took him out, he got, you know, a brace. But um but he's yeah, he's he's he's very inconsistent, but he has got a se he has got a good ceiling. But Salah, yeah, if obviously if Salah approaches anything like old Salah, then he's worth the money. So you So when would you you're not thinking this game week though. What are you thinking this game week? >> I think if I were to do it, it should be this game week because again, if >> Yeah. Well, because the run starts, right? They've got, you know, Liverpool have a better fixture this week than than than uh than than Man City do. I mean, I think Newcastle >> Forest >> Yeah. >> Soough I love it because you can captain him in every single week for next um until the end of the season to be honest. I mean Forest next game then they have West Ham at home, Wolves away, Tottenham at home, Brighton away, Fulham at home, Everton away, Chris. >> It's a run. I mean like if you ever if you're going to make the switch this that this is a season defining switch, right? This could be the thing that just cuz you're getting ahead of the ahead of the kind of I like it. I like it. I I've not considered Salah at all just because it's just out of my head. But but now you're going to make me go away and think about this the rest of the day. >> You swine. >> Yeah. The problem with it is that City are now back on for the league. Um I can't imagine Halen is actually out. Uh but you know his minutes in recent weeks haven't been great and he hasn't been you know the Holland that we're paying 14.5 or >> I'd rather have Smen than Holland to be honest. >> Me too at that price point and that would that's what that would allow me later down the line. Of course, I'm going to have City assets going forward because they're going to inevitably have a double gameweek or two and because of that, you know, whether I don't have Erling Haland and I'll need to cover him somehow. And for me, I feel like Semeno again at the price point. It's not it's not a like for like, you know, comparison because of course Hand has the penalties, but Semeno has just been on such good form this season. Ever since he came into that team, he's just fit in perfectly. And again, watching >> Yeah. And he's just is, you know, exactly. He's the same guy in a different team. It's very hard. That doesn't happen very often. I mean, you know, but he's just slotted in and picked up where he left off at Bournemouth, right? And uh and he's been given he's been given the minutes and the freedom to do that. So So yeah, the seller shout it's very you. But I I'm I'm already in my head that's like, \"Oh, yeah. I like I like the flavor of I don't know if I'd go echk.\" But then again, I was actually looking at at Van Dijk to come in and uh and Vertz. So that's an interesting different variation. I was I'm interested in getting on Liverpool as well. And yeah, something about Verts, the chatter I'm hearing elsewhere, you know, seeing his performances, you know, and obviously some good returns. I I he's intriguing me. But but yeah, Salah Salah's a big bet. Oh. Oh, I like that. I do like that. I've got five transfers. I could do that. I could get off it. >> Chris, talk to me about Ekkit, right? Amongst my own friends, so maybe I'm, you know, kind of blinded. >> Conversation about Echitique in terms of strikers in the league. Do you like Ekit first off? And where does he rank for you? >> I I I I like him as a player. I just don't think it doesn't it's I don't know. He's so streaky. like he he's he's he's got you earlier in the season he had like he had a nice run of of uh 1339 against leads but Brian Spurs and he's you know looked looked great. it looked like he was setting off and then you know and then there's I think a bit of an injury and then obviously early in the season they're messing about with him and Isak and then he just since he's come back he's he's like I I got him I think it was about gameweek 19 or something and it was just kind of like yeah five five points in five games some of that cuz he was missing some of that cuz he had managed minutes and and if he was playing guaranteed to play and start every match you and and sals and dish form deliveries coming in. I think he's a great option. I just I just think he's they're still monkeying about with him a lot. I don't know. I as as a player I like him. I like him. Every time we're actually in for him or looking at him when he was uh in in France, wasn't he? That's where he came from. Um was I think he was in France. I think maybe Mar anyway. We're looking at a couple of seasons ago and it never came off. Um not saying I'm not saying our record with strikers is is particularly great, but um but yeah, I think he's a good striker. I I I I like him. Um and I he's clearly got he's he's clearly a player that can easily deliver you double digits, but it just also seems a player that can get, you know, left on the bench or subbed off after after half an hour, you know, after an hour or something. I don't know. It's I don't quite understand it. >> I'm lucky he's not have more returns, always involved. >> Yeah, I agree with Simeon. I think he's absolutely raw uh talent and for me I love that in FPL a Liverpool striker uh who just loves to you know he's not afraid to take the ball and shoot. I mean that's exactly what he is. He's very very row and for me I I really like him as you know as a player. I think in FPL if you have him you definitely hold him. The fixture run is there for Liverpool and I would have absolutely no problem with bringing him in. I mean in comparison to Erling Halen who is just completely off it. I'm not trying to make a Erling Halen narrative again because the fixtures also fall really nicely for City. They are on for for the league. I mean, >> you know, you can't really go against Halen, but Ekit and Salah might be better than Royce and Halen given that they don't have a fixture in 31. Readjust the team in 32 and >> you've got to deal with that at some point. And as you say, you know, you're not wanting to use your free hit on that. You're wanting to you're playing for that. I I you've got if you're dealing with that issue as well early on. Um yeah, I I I don't hate it. I I think the thing that if it was just Harland to echo okay, interesting, but you know, they're both players that have got a high ceiling, you know, and and and you know, Harland could could easily just come back into it and smash a couple of hats. He's he is still the best top scoring forward in the game by by by some distance, right? I mean he's got not quite twice the points of echet when he's more minutes obviously but he is he is a long way clear in terms of the top scoring kind of forwards um of Thiago and J Pedro so I I don't but if it was just that move I I I I would be like okay but the Salah thing which is what it's enabling I do like that I like that a lot >> yeah something to think on and that's that would be where my mind is currently again looking forward to game 31 again I don't want Declan Rice um for immediate short-term or even long run because again he doesn't have a fixture in 31. So for me, he's a sell either way. Selling him right now. >> Arsenal's fixtures are getting more difficult, right? That's not to say Rice can't return as mean won't get defcons, but they've got they're coming into a tougher tougher fixture on Arsenal now. You know, I mean, obviously Spurs were holding for that, but then it's Chelsea Chelsea at home. Uh who else they got then? Got Brighton away. Maybe that's not that tough at the moment the way Brighton are playing. uh Everton at home. Obviously very difficult game, but um but yeah, I I I I I'm I'm for the first time for a long time, I'm feeling especially with that running to 31, I'm feeling that um it could be a time to sort of say goodbye to to Rice, but I also want to say goodbye to Enzo. So after this week anyway, I've had enough of of Enzo, my second own second stint of ownership. So I'm kind of uh [snorts] I've got a few I'd like to move on, but yeah. Yeah. Um, and also the other option I could do would be to bring in Florian Verts. I have 8.9 million in the bank to do Rice H to Verts and that would leave me with.5. So >> I don't think that's a bad option at all. I just don't think it's necessary this particular game week. I mean, I have no issue with playing the team I do have. And again, Forest is a brilliant fixture for a player like Vertz. He got subbed off um with 10 minutes to go in the cup and he's been the hardest Liverpool team so far this season h along with Dominic Obisla who's come up with big goals. So um >> would you would you definitely go vert at this point if you were going to Liverpool putting aside Salah and Ekit you've talked about would you go Vertz over Sabai? >> Oh yeah >> obviously there's a price differential there right? Yeah, for sure. I just feel like, you know, you can expect um verts to be more involved. A lot of softiz returns or goals even this season in all competitions have been set pieces. Uh barely odd few um you know, in play ones, but >> I don't think you know numbers wise he's largely involved unless he's going to score a screamer, which I mean for a player of Dominic Sabasai's quality uh who has a laser of a shot on him, you wouldn't be surprised. But for me, I'm more of a Florian inverts type of guy and you know, I haven't enjoyed owning Sabasside this season. >> In the in the chat, they're saying there's Susant saying he'd play Rice over Sessi and Cap Harland, but you're not you're saying you're keeping Rice this week, but you're not playing him. >> Yeah, I don't like the last time you played Tottenham, he did hit defcon in fairness. Um, but like >> corners, knock a knock a corner in as well. you know, >> against Vicario with no arms. That's a good point. But I I just can't seem to push myself to do it. Two Arsenal is enough for me. >> You're already you're already feeling bad about two. I can tell that you're already feeling bad about backing to Arsenal against your own club. I get it. It's fair enough. >> I don't think he gets in ahead of Sessi though, me personally. Like >> no, >> Sessi has decent attacking number as well. Again, he's been off in the last two game weeks maybe, but I still feel like there's an asset in Sessi. uh you know and as good as West Ham have been that's West Ham's problem is that they're inconsistent and I know in the last few they have turned it up but who knows going with Bournemouth what you're going to h you're going to get and I have no problem with playing Sessi. >> Yeah. Yeah. There's a there's a note about Holland being yellow flagged. I mean I think that's because he didn't play um in the cup right that's >> and he got subbed off early. >> Subbed off early. Right. That subbed off early. Yeah. I just to be clear that Sorry, you're right. sub. I was I was looking at two bits of news at the same time. Um yeah, you know, it does say Holland is not 100% but and he got subbed off early, but usually the 75% yellow flag that almost automatic when a player gets subbed off early without, you know, it being very clearly tactical. So I I yes pay attention to that but don't I wouldn't let that in it on its own decide your decisions whether the fact he's got a yellow flag because that that that is applied really um very very uh regularly whenever a player comes off early. Um so yeah I I I I think you can wait a little bit with that. So, and and you don't think you're not you're happy you're captain of Fernandez >> against the fortress Hill Vickinson, which has not been a fortress at all [snorts] >> definitely fully fit starting this game versus Newcastle. How Newcastle have been. I know they won in the cup, but >> yeah. Yeah, >> I still fancy them. Um, you know, City are just I feel like they're really going to go for this title and obviously, you know, we're used to seeing City do it. So, this is usually the time and period that they really turn >> it on. Yeah. Yeah, >> they get into that unbeatable phase, don't they? They get into that phase every other season where they just don't they win every game >> and then, you know, somebody else chokes and that's it. But um yeah, there's there's a lot of love for uh a lot of love for Rice over Sessie. Apparently Bournemouth Bournemouth only one clean sheet on the road. So not I'm not not confirming that fact, but that was uh but yeah, you go with it. You're going to go with what you want to go with anyway. I I will not be surprised to see this side has Salah and Ech. [laughter] >> I surely can't do that. Surely not. >> I'm really tempted. I'm not going to lie to you. Like um anyway, >> I'm really tempted now. I wasn't thinking about that at all. Neither those players. I'm not about Ekit, but definitely Salah. >> It's the two that get me in my head. >> Like I'm I'm two players uh worse off right now than if I do Salah and Nekit for the two lads. Uh and also Liverpool are likely to have a double in 33 also. Uh and I believe don't get me uh don't quote me if I'm wrong but the fixture in 33 if City do double is against one of them is Arsenal. Um let me just fact check that real quick but not not that Liverpool's um you know much more impressive but in 33 if I just look at some of the projections Liverpool were ever in Crystal Palace and City with Arsenal and Burnley in the doubles. So maybe it does balance out the best team and the worst team or two good teams for Liverpool. But either way, >> two good fixtures for Liverpool assets if I do go down there. >> No, I I think I think getting a Liverpool now is is is they've been you know and again I think there's the there's differential points there like you know they they've they've been abandoned the assets kind of largely. Obviously FPL general hasn't got any uh hasn't got Salah or or Hol this year, but he wouldn't go early. But but they've been um yeah, it's been interesting. He went with that at the start of the season and everyone was being like, \"Oh, he's didn't start particularly well, but he's he's going to come out with quite a good finish, I think, because because neither of them have consistently really delivered the I mean, they've done it okay, you know, but not not the points that we'd expect.\" So, it's interesting. But yeah, yeah, Liverpool, getting on Liverpool, I'm I'm even as as an Everton fan, I don't don't enjoy backing Liverpool assets, but I think that's definitely in my in my mind as well. Um, when to switch. Like I say, I was thinking Verts this week, but but now the Salah thing, now you put the Salah thing in my head, it's there now. >> So, if you went Salah this week, you captain Salah, right? >> Absolutely. Um, I would absolutely captain Salah this game week. That means I would have four transfers and 10 players going into gameweek 31. Uh which means that in gameweek 32 I'd have four transfers preparing for the double in 33 with potentially of course depend on how the fixtures land. But >> potentially with already um eight players with double game weeks if the double >> you you you convinced me man. This is the way to go. I'm I'm I'm all over this like a rash. I'm just thinking I because I don't mind I don't mind pushing off Harland. Um the only problem with it and this is for both of us is we both played our wild card, right? So >> there's no going back. >> Well, going back is tough. It it would mean sacrificing Salah the way and and and and you know it's it's it's going to be expensive. I don't know how much how much uh extra cash. What's he at now? What's he actually at? Harland 14.9. So yeah. So there's there's there's he's very expensive and there's like money saved from having him at the start of the season that you've earned. You're going to lose point three or point you know at least in that. So um that's the only thing against it. That's a like you say it's a one-way ticket. It's unlikely you're going to come back but I actually would feel like I said before I'd be feel happy if I can get into Semeno instead. I could probably live with that. I think Smenya can cover most of Harlem's points the rest of the season. That's where you heard it. This is Harland about to go on to a hat-tick hat-tick hat-trick run. Uh I've I've I've basically damned damned all non Harolland owners because I'm just saying that he's he's maybe not the best asset at the moment. Um >> and lastly, Chris, before we finish up again, we're just at the 40minute mark. Vtor Pereira has just been confirmed by Nottingham Forest taking in charge this at home fixture versus Liverpool in gameweek 27. Um interesting appointments. I don't know how I feel about that overall. >> Does that change anything for you? Absolutely not. There's no man who could have went in for Forest. That would change my mind. >> I don't I don't think that changes anything for me. I like I say, I think I think that makes it more likely Liverpool score hatful than less. >> To be honest, and Sean D's team like >> Yeah. No, I do. I do I do actually think that I mean like Dice has has got um I think Dice got some results for us against Liverpool. Um you know, we we've we've Yeah, we didn't get spanked though. I like I I this this is Liverpool on form against Wolves if they're really at it. I mean that's that could be a big big number and I don't know we'll we'll see. Obviously no disrespect to to Victor Pereira like he did well but sorry against Forest I think it could be a big number so I meant Forest not Wolves sorry. >> Yeah too confused when people manage the marriage manager or merry ground is is is crazy. So are you are you just final question for for me to you about Spurs you talked about earlier obviously this guy Eigor we don't know what he's gonna be likes it's you know we'll see good luck to him right good luck to you but in the summer you think it's just PCH all over PCH does world cup >> I think it has PCH written all over it and I think if he wasn't in charge of this World Cup he'd be in right now um I'd be very >> wouldn't want you wouldn't want a Glasner or you know >> the reason I think PCH is the perfect man for the job is >> you wouldn't want Amarim or a Sha dash >> or a Carrick What the club is missing is togetherness. Pochino I can guarantee you that whether or not he's >> I think PCH I think PCH would be I mean he should they say never go back right but I I think you know Moyes has been is is is doing a decent job on Everton. I'm really happy for him to be back. So I I think yeah he had a good connection there didn't he Poch and he was much loved. So I I I think uh yeah it's going to be uh I know Sam Sam Bonfield's FPL family will be very happy if they get PCH back. >> I [snorts] will be a happy man also. Anyway, Chris, we'll wrap it up there. We're just having >> We'll wrap it up. We've got Yeah, we've got no football apart from FA Cup this until FA Cup and then it's Champions League and we we Yeah, we'll be uh but but the the round will have kicked off obviously by Tommy speak again. So, good luck. Good luck whatever you do. I look forward to talking to you about how Salah captain's gone for you next week and uh maybe I'll be there as well. >> Who knows? But anyway, we'll leave it there and do hit the like button and subscribe to Fast Football Scout before you go. And as usual, we will see you in the next"

      "transcript": "Hi everyone, welcome to Early Thoughts. Looking ahead of gameweek 27. And as you can see, the superstar Praz is not here. But don't worry, don't worry. I've got an unbelievable replacement. Sam, how you doing? >> I'm like the world's worst substitute for Pra. >> N you're an excellent substitute. >> Everyone coming here to see Pra, I'm really sorry. You're stuck with me for a little bit, but Paz will be back for 27 prop, but he'll be back for your final thoughts. So, he's he's only a temporary substitution. I'm like the interim. We're going to talk about some managers later, aren't we? So, we we'll consider me the interim manager while Pra is out of action. >> Praise hasn't been sacked like Thomas Frank. He hasn't been sacked. Don't worry, he'll be back. It's just uh you know these superstar content creators, Sam, soon as this FA Cup or international break, they're jet setting. >> I know. gone. Nah, they don't do content. >> He's like, \"Sorry, guys. I'm out of here. I got to take my holiday while I can.\" He's like, \"The Spurs players off on a 12-day break.\" >> That's what he's doing. >> Rest in recuperation. >> Exactly. Let's hope he does return like you said for final thoughts for gameweek 27. Um, great timing to have you, Sam. Great timing because a lot we're still we're recording Thursday night. The Arsenal game is currently on. We'll try and keep up with the updates on that. But also look what's happened at Tottenham. Just look at what's happened. What's going on, Sam? What is happening to your team? >> Oh, Mo. Do you know what? Three on a bit weeks ago, I sat in the stands watching us lose to West Ham in the 90 odd minute. And I came home that night and I posted a little video on my Instagram and I was like, I'm done. I'm done now. I've supported this man. I've been nothing but loyal and I'm done with him. Because as much as I don't think that all of the problems at Spurs are caused by Thomas Frank, and I think that's proven by the amount of managers that we've had in recent years, I do think that a lot of what's happening right now is problematic in terms of or or has been problematic in terms of whether people actually follow what he's saying and his direction at the club. I mean, walking around the Bournemouth stadium holding an Arsenal mug is, you know, possibly the biggest disrespectful thing you can do to the Tottenham fan base. And in that moment, I think he lost 99% of those that were still loyal to him. And I think over the last few weeks, he's lost the players as well. Like the fact that Mickey Vanderven's having to go into his office twice and apologize for ignoring him and ranting and that's really not a Mickey Vanerven characteristic that we've seen over the last few years. So, it's been a disaster. I think they should have done it three weeks ago. I kind of understand why they've done it now though because like I said before when we were joking about PR, like we have got this period of time off now because obviously we're also out of the FA Cup. So nice window of time between the game we played on Tuesday night and then the Arsenal game, which is our fixture of gameweek 27, while they work out what on earth they're doing. And I I do think this wasn't a planned thing necessarily. I I do think the board plan to stick with him and see him through till the end of the season, but I think on Wednesday evening or Tuesday evening rather when we lose to Newcastle and we are so close now to the relegation zone like Jules joked with me on the FPL pod last week and he was like you know you're in a relegation battle and I laughed it off and then we've had two game weeks since then of which we've picked up no points and at the same time West Ham have picked up four points for a win and a Sure. And leads are picking up points and even Forest have picked up a point in the game against wolves. So those when those around you start picking up points, even if it's just a draw and you lose the potential to gain six, it becomes untenable and and they just have to do something about it. So yeah, now we're going to need a character him. I think >> why h why did it go so wrong? So I actually like Thomas Frank and I was actually rooting for him. I was hoping he would do well, but >> why? Apart from the Arsenal Cup, which I think he got done like a like he got done like a kipper there to be face. I don't think it was >> chicken. No, I know. >> But I did see a lot of Tottenham fans, even ones who are not very vocal were actually they wanted him gone. >> Yeah. >> And I was quite Yeah. It did like what happened? What's happened? >> I mean, I think in in many ways, Mo, I don't think it's his fault. like he starts the season, we were without Kulusfki, who by the way was due back at Christmas and it's now midFebruary and he's still not back. >> Um, we were without Madison who got injured in preseason. We have been without many over and it's no excuse, but we've been we start the season without the Yes. Sanki is another without our big key asset. So, we're going into the season already with a squad that feels compromised. And as the season goes on, it gets more and more compromised to the fact that we're now down to four attacking assets that are fit. That's it. We've only got four. We've got Salanki. Thank goodness Sanki is back. We've got Salanki up top. Um, we've got Kola Moani and Tell to be honest, neither of which are good enough, but they're fit, so that makes them first choice. Uh, and then we've got Javi Simmons who thank goodness seems to be finding a little bit of form and a little bit of grit and weight and desire because we really, really need it. And that's it. Even goes off injured and is now out for the rest of the season. I mean that the reports are that that's going to be somewhere between 9 and 12 months of recovery for him. Still no closer to Kulleski. Madison's still out. Kudis is out until at least the March international break and that's if we don't get another set back. So he has been fighting a losing battle for a long time. >> The January transfer window, Gallagher comes in, which in itself I think is a really interesting >> player because don't get me wrong, I love him. I think he's great. But why does he sign for Spurs? Because he's got the opportunity to go to Aston Villa. So there's at the time I thought maybe he wants to be in London. Maybe that's why. Now I'm wondering if there was something more going on behind the scenes. is like I'm wondering whether there was a conversation that says we're looking for an new appointment of manager in the summer and maybe we get one that you've worked with before in Poccino and then if you're here maybe there's an existing relationship he's also worked with Javi Simmons before um PCH so I don't know maybe it's just me you know >> looking positively on things but I think we just need to go and find an interim now and my worry is who is it going to be? >> Yeah, I know there's no there's I don't know who actually I've not even seen any names. I've seen already Nottingham and Forest another team who sacked their manager. >> Four in one season. >> Yeah, they're going to be the first Premier League club to have four managers in one season. >> Very impressive. >> Very impressive by that owner there. I have to be honest. But everyone's panicking what you said. Leeds doing well and West Ham and everyone's thinking we can't go down. So is anyone being just before we finish up with uh on on Tottenham, is there anyone being targeted for any names being mentioned for the >> for the forest job? >> No, for the Tottenham Spurs for >> now. Well, the the immediate conversation goes back to Ryan Mason again, who's been our interim three times already. Okay. >> Um had a successful time as interim the first time around. Um and actually, you know, did a really good job. Second time, not so much. Um then obviously he was sacked by West Brom in January. >> Yeah. >> Uh so he is currently unemployed. I personally don't know whether that's the right thing to do. Like at first my thought was just get Mason back. Just put it with Mason. At least he's passionate. At least he knows the club. He knows the players. He is a safeish pair of hands. I think we'd stay up under him because that's what it's come down to now. It's like who's going to keep us up. >> Um I think I think he's capable of doing that. Harry Rednap. I like that. He threw his name in the hat. Said I'll do it. I'll keep him up. Get Crouchy back. Crouch replied to his tweet. Yeah, I kind of >> He's like, \"Yeah, exactly. Wants to reunite the crew.\" Um, I think it will be somebody like that. Robbie Keane's name's been in the mix. He's currently in Hungary managing. So, there was conversation around him. I think it will be somebody like that. It will be a club person, somebody who can come in and manage the situation out for the end of the season. My gut feeling is it's potties. I think but we can't the payout for taking him ahead of the World Cup is astronomical and there's no chance that Spurs pay it. >> So, and and does PCH want to come before the World Cup? Like he's put up with a load of nonsense managing America to get to the World Cup. Yeah. >> Do you realistically walk out a few months before? >> I don't think so. So, he's gonna stick it out till after the World Cup and then I suspect they'll try and get him. That's that's what the Spurs fans want. If if they want to do something that the the fan base want, that's what they'll do. Um because I think the other managers that are out there, I I mean, they're not going to get the likes of Jave or Zabi Alonzo or they're not going to get that type of manager. They could wait it out and try and get in a battle with Manchester United for Glasgner in the summer. That's possible when he leaves Palace. Is he better than PCH back? >> I don't know. Like it all feels very unknown. >> I think we want PCH back. Anyway, as non n on Tottenham fans, I want to see PCH back in the Premier League. >> I do. I do want to see P. >> Yeah. So, I'd be happy with that. But that's that's that's enough Tottenham now. This is the most we've ever spoken about Tottenham on this pod. >> Let's move on. Let's move on. >> Honestly, but uh just before we even get into our teams here, Sam, just quickly, how's uh your gameweek 26? We know it's still going on. It's a double game week. How is it going for you so far? And how's your season in general? Just just for how's that going? >> The season's been difficult. I think that's the best way of describing it. It has been difficult. It's been one of those seasons where I feel like every couple of game weeks I take a big step forward and then all of a sudden it's like little little step back, little step back, little step back, little step back and then I'm back where I started from and then I go again. I take a big green arrow. a wild carded early a few weeks back and actually since then it's been it's been really positive. Like I've gone up 1.1 million places since then. So it's it's been a big jump in three weeks. Um this week's not going >> it's going okay. I mean I thanks to the Man City players. I had Harland's assist. I Harland's goal rather. I had Semeno and our gay. So the three of them have kind of saved the day. I've currently got free Arsenal playing. So the double Arsenal defense and Timber and Gabrielle who's got my triple captaincy because >> which is one nil Arsenal by the way. >> Yeah is one nil. >> Is it Maki who scored? Okay. Did Gabrielle get the assist? >> He did not. It was Hinki. So it was another defense. It was one of them, isn't it? That you always going to have the wrong one I think in this double. And Gabrielle's actually annoyingly been booked in this game already. So, if it's just a clean sheet that he gets, then it's going to be five. That'll be 15 going into the next round. And then we just wait and see. This is the game I'm least uh positive about. I think from a from an Arsenal perspective, it's realistically it's about the Wolves game, I think. Um, but I've also got Declan Rice as well. So, double Arsenal defense and Rice. >> Um, I don't have any Wolves, so going into next week, it will be them three. But yeah, I mean I feel like it's it's looking >> Did you triple cap him? >> I did. Yeah, I wasn't going to. >> Yeah, I I had no intention of there was no plans to do it up until about two hours before the deadline and then I thought, what am I waiting for here? So, my original plan was to, and this is rogue because I'm having such a rubbish season. And I was like, maybe I take this as an opportunity to use the triple captaincy in the blank game week in 31 and pick somebody out there and because I don't think I'll have a team of 11. I think I'll probably go into it with um 10 men. So if I use the triple cap, it gives me the opportunity to boost from there. So that was in my head that was where I was. But actually then I just thought maybe this is the right opportunity because as we get into the other doubles I'm going to want to play my bench boost probably my free hit. I'm going to run out of doubles for chips. So it's either now and it's punty or it's later in a single game week. And in the end I just thought just go now because I'm on big green arrows for the last few weeks. If this works, it would be a good it'd be a good boost and it's a good opportunity for me to kind of get further. Uh Gabrielle's currently on seven Defcon, so hopefully what we got we got half an hour left. He get three more in half an hour. So if we could get Defcon in this >> and a clean sheet, that's that's excellent. That's a great start to a double game and a triple captain. >> Yeah. So it's going all right. How's your game going? Not too different from what I read. >> Game week not very good. Season not very good. So you've come >> it's been hard. At least you've had some boost. I I don't even have boosts. Every week is just >> you can come and join AZ and I on the Q&A if you want cuz it's just it's >> it's just a disaster. >> It's a safe space to cry because AZ >> is probably in the same room as me. I mean Emma me and AZ are really um in the pits. come join us on the Q&A because I'm only ahead of him up until last week. So as and I finished gameweek 26 >> on the same points. So I've been chasing him down. So we ended up gamewe no we ended up gameweek where are we now gameweek 25 we ended up on the same exactly the same when we're sitting level. >> I'm now 15 points ahead of him after this game week. So he's raging. I'm still not happy with my rank but he's fuming bless him. So come to the Q&A with us. It's very safe space over there on a Thursday afternoon. >> Yeah, long as we're allowed to cry, I will join you lot because this season good because me and Pra, we've been crying here weekly. So, you're in good. You're in good place. Early thoughts, final thoughts. This season has been just a a difficult season. But, um, right, we're going to get stuck into it now. We're going to go into my team actually, and I might need some of your green arrow inspiration because I'm going to tell you now, Sam, have a look at this team here. It's currently not doing that well. We know it's still game week 27 26. But I'm looking ahead now. I'm going to run through my team. >> Mo, there's no reason this team shouldn't be doing well. >> But this is the thing though, Sam. Every week I look at my team with a bit of hope thinking surely should be okay. But honestly, I'm I'm at at the start I was upset cuz we're so competitive. Obviously, we do. We love FPL. We want to do good and you know, >> but every week it's been disappointment. every 50/50. All the little tight decisions and a bit of luck here and there. Don't get me wrong, there'll be bad decisions by me at times as well, but uh just being one of those just it's just one of those just one of those things. Everything that could go wrong goes wrong. That's the the honest truth of it. But uh so I'm going to take you through the team and I'll take you through some early thoughts I'm actually having happen um having so 2.8 8 million in the bank, two free transfers, Rya Ringol, Muki, who's been one of the few good signings I've had, been a super superstar, Gabrielle O'Reilly, Rice, Enzo, Fernandez, Rogers, and Wilson. And up top is Harland and Ekit. On the bench, Dravka, Keane, Raldon, and Mark Guey. So, like you said, the team in theory looks not looks not too bad. What are my pro what are my problem areas here? So, Keen disappointed me. So I'm currently in game 26. I started him and to sum up this season you saw what happened. Did you see what happened with that? Okay. He came on. He as he came on the referee blew a whistle. Literally I don't think it was 93rd minute. I just What can he do? You just have to laugh. I mean to be fair he only blocked Muki who ended up getting is it two points? >> He got two. Yeah. >> Yeah. Say it wasn't. It would have hurt if Mugi kept a game sheet. I would have been on holiday with PZ. You would have been here. I live in here by myself. I had to get a in again. >> Yeah, you would have to get a in to cover us. But um so that's the one problem area. I'll tell you what I've got with two fridge transfers and and what I'm thinking. Then you can give me some of your thoughts please. Anything you could share. So >> keen to potentially someone like a cheaper I don't mind dropping down to like Hill for Bournemouth. He's been a superstar. >> Absolutely. >> He's been and can I be honest? I nearly went there like I do a deadline stream yesterday. I'm on there. I nearly went keen to heal and I nearly done Mark Gooey to Shan Lawson. >> Oh man, >> I know I know I know right but I didn't do it thinking oh this is one of the few opportunities I can roll and maybe have to Yeah, I know it didn't work that that one day unfortunately but uh so say Keane drop him down to someone like Hill and then I'm looking at something like this maybe because I'm chasing points now. You can tell me if this is actually a good idea or not. I could potentially go Enzo to Palmer and captain him. They've got Burnley. >> That's that's early. It's very early thinking. You know, it's one of the ideas that's coming to my head. At >> one stage, I thought I was going to have to deal with O'Reilly, but it does look like he is still playing in midfield. Even though Nori's playing. We thought eight Nory coming back >> is going to finish him off, but he's still Yeah, we actually even scored this week, so that that was a big bonus for us. >> Yeah. He got He did get you 12 points, didn't he? I think O'Reilly. >> Yes, he did. Yeah, it was a lovely return. Um, >> so what do you what do you think of those moves, Sam? What do you think of those moves? >> Do you know it's it's funny because on the Q&A last week, I said I thought I didn't think Palmer was even in the top five best Chelsea assets to own. And since then, he's won well, J Pedro's won him three penalties with the three most ridiculous fouls I have ever seen. Like, they're just basically the same foul three times and it wins him a penalty. He's basically just become a pen merchant, which let's be real. That's why you buy these assets in FPL, right? Because they've won penalties and all of that. So, I get it. Um, and they've got like they've got the best fixture of the game week coming up at the weekend when they or next weekend when they play Burnley. Like that's unbelievable. The problem I sort of have for a little bit with Chelsea is after that because after that it's Arsenal versus and then it's Villa Newcastle, Everton before Man City, Man United. Like that run for Chelsea after Burnley is awful. And I think that's my slight issue with Palmer is that you got to find 10.5 million for this week. He's captainable. He looks brilliant. >> But it's one of those, isn't it, where you're kind of like, well, do I go there? Because he seems to be over the fitness issues now. He seems to be fully back to himself. Therefore, the minutes risk stuff maybe isn't there as much as it has been over the last 3, four, five weeks. Um, but after this one, the fixtures are more difficult. And I would expect that teams like Arsenal defense isn't going to give away such soft Oh, Mo, the Arsenal clean sheets just gone. >> No way. >> Oh, it has. >> Oh, don't tell me it's Thiago. >> I don't know yet. It hasn't flashed up on who it was. >> This is breaking news. >> Breaking news. Um, but I would expect the Arsenal I was just about to say I would expect the Arsenal defense to be more secure than we're going to get against Burnley. Um, so I get it. Like I get the desire for um to own him. Like I can see the fear. Have you not got like do do you want him more than you want J Pedro? So this is I'll go back to my team and I'll tell you I think I've reached the stage of the season now Sam where I'm definitely going to take a bit more risk my season I'm not going to finish where I would normally like to finish. Okay I'm at one I'm at peace with that. >> So trying to to pick captains or aggressive plays where possible. I know this uses a transfer because like you said after game week 27 goals I'm looking at my team and it it might not look look as appealing >> but I I could go Xiao Pedro. could go. I was I was actually preparing for Thiago Sam instead. >> I was preparing the features to them are great. >> Exactly that. And he's being he's been another pen machine and been playing well to be fair to him. I don't want to be too harsh on him. So I was cons that's an option as well. Although having said that, Ekit is good. So if I go Thiago, I've got to bring up Mark. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Bring him up. So these are ideas in my head. But I think maybe it's just the recency bias of Palmer doing really well. And it's not just the penalties. If you watch the his matches, he he actually had a good performance in the last >> Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. >> He did have a good he did have a good performance and he's got playing with the that carrot of a World Cup spot which is very competitive at the moment. So, you're going to you're going to think he's going to want to turn it on for the remainder of the season. Maybe being sensible like you said, I could go elsewhere like Thiago and then I'm pl it's longer term moves because it is possible I go Palmer and try my luck in the captaincy and then I look to move him on to Embumo or someone else maybe. Or do you think that's a wasted transfer? Do you think I should look? >> I honestly I'm having similar thoughts with my team to be honest because I'm looking at it. I've also got Enzo who it's so frustrating because his xG numbers are still good that like the underlying data is still really good and in the last two matches he just hasn't got any points and it's like it's really annoying because you have him for this great fantastic runner fixtures that they've had over the last couple of weeks and then Palmer's back and you like in my head I keep thinking I'll bling Palmer because otherwise Enzo takes those three pens suddenly we're absolutely laughing as Enzo owners we're really ahead so It's really difficult and I think I look at the Chelsea team and I think well there's an opportunity here to to invest in somebody but then I'm also thinking more long as somebody that's already played my wild card. I'm also got to think more longer term with my team and I can't I have to be thinking about the blanking 31 and >> yes >> the the amount of Arsenal and Manchester City assets I have and how I'm managing that. So those transfers that I have have to be in some ways dealing with my gameweek 31 issues as well as the other issues that I have coming. So there is a bit of me that's kind of in the back of my head thinking well you know getting rid of because you know there are unlike your three Arsenal which is the kind of sensible way of doing it because Rya can just move to the bench and you can whether you want to play Davo or not is irre is kind of irrelevant that week like you have got a playing goalkeeper that you can play and it means you've only got two Arsenal and two Man City to deal with whereas I've got three outfield Arsenal and three outfield Man City so something's got to give there. Um, so there's part of me that's kind of thinking, well, do I if I go for another Chelsea asset, do I have to take out Enzo this week or would I keep Enzo this week? If I was to free up the money to go to Cole Palmer, am I downgrading other spots in my team where there could be some significant improvement had? Um like cuz I'm looking at the like your midfield on paper is fantastic. Um and like but realistically the bench is your issue now. Going from Keen to Hill. I've been talk which was really annoying since I wild carded I've non-stop spoken about Hill everywhere I've been and and for some unknown reason when I wild carded I decided to get Cessi instead and it's because I had the money. So I was like well I've got the extra money. Sessi's got that attacking threat. I'll just go there. That that's great. That hasn't been >> and so far so far that's going equivalent of say Muki Alen Alderete you know there's little it's exactly like that I know and it happens unfortunately through the season. Yeah, and it's so annoying, especially with the price difference between the two of them because obviously that money makes a big difference across the rest of the team. But I get I I absolutely can see why you want to go for Palmer and I can also see the appeal of him over Jal Pedro when you look at the ownership because if you're not happy with your rank like neither of us are, >> you do have to try and make some interesting and difficult decisions and like I've been without J Pedro like you have over the last few weeks. I thought I could cover it. Last week it sort of covered with Dominic Calbertt Leuen. This week I knew I wouldn't be able to cover it with Calbertt Lewin and then he wasn't even around so that was fun. Um although I had benched him anyway. Uh so >> imagine me I've kept Eatik. I've really shown faith in him apart from that one hall. He's been he's been a a bad FPL asset. He really has. He hasn't. It's unfortunate. I mean the fixtures are about to turn and he's a good player. I do rate him but he has been super frustrating if I'm if I'm honest to use an example. I've tried my best to cuz you get caught in between trying to be very aggressive and you can't change everyone every week. So you you put faith in you put faith in certain players to think I'm going to give them three or four five games >> but when I've done that this season it really hasn't materializing. He he's becoming one of those. I don't think I can move him on now. >> But my and Mo the fixtures for Liverpool are just brilliant. >> Very good. They're very very good. I'm going to bring them up. >> You look at the next like is Forest. God knows what kind of Forest. I mean, if it's Victor Pereira's forest, which is what we looked like it's going to be. I mean, I know he kept Wolves up last year, but then the opening part of the season, what did he get? Two points in 30 from 30 available. Like, and then he gets sacked from Wolves. >> I mean, they're going to play attacking football, which is what Maverinos wants. He wants them to play this attacking football. Well, mate, you had the most attacking manager in the world. Impossible. >> I was about to say, exactly. And it went so badly because the players that you have at Forest aren't they're not that that's not them. So you can bring in another attacking manager all you want, but I'm telling you now it's not going to go well. And Liverpool for all of your defensive woes in recent weeks, the attack has been really good and against that Nottingham Forest defense that there'll be goals. And then you look across the rest of it. West Ham Spurs, Brighton, Fulham, Everton, >> they're very good fixtures. And I think I'm going to just I think I'm going to leave I think going back to my team before we move on to your team. I think I'm going to leave Ekitique in for that reason. So I I can't change him, but I have got the money in the bank. It's possibility I need to look at maybe say Mark Goo to Thiago and maybe Keen down to Hill if I can afford that. In fact, I'm going to check that in a minute. If I can afford that, that might be a more sensible move. But you like you described a minute ago, Sam, it's that feeling of trying to chase now. I've probably missed the Palmer bolt now the points because three penalties in in two games or something like that. You know what the what's the probability of getting more penalties? >> Well, it depends, doesn't it, whether everyone's going to keep fouling them in the same way? Like are Burnley going to foul J Pedro in exactly the same way that they have been? Pedro going to keep falling down like like >> cuz if he is then goodness me like >> but then after that it's this week this week's the problem. Like I'm looking at a team like yours that's only got Enzo in it and I'm thinking this could be a problem. This could be a problem going into the Burnley game. But after Burnley I'm less worried about having another Chelsea asset. >> Let's uh let's segue. That was a good segue to your team. I think my team I'm there at the moment. It is early thoughts. We've still got the FA Cup games to go. Injuries could change my plans and stuff like that. But it is if I'm if I was going to say to you now Sam what moves I'm going to do. It's either Guy to Thiago and Keane to Hill. >> Okay. I think I can even do Raldon as well. If I had a feeling Keem because they did get a red card, didn't they? Is that only one game or three games? I can't remember. Is it Braveweight? Brandweight. Sorry. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Does that mean Keane gets free game? I don't know. Maybe I'm reaching there. But so that's one option or I can go go for it and do Palmer and and so I can make that work as well. So they're they're the two moves I'm thinking about. But let's uh let's have a look at your team. Talk us through your team then Sam. >> So much like yours, it looks good. Like it it looks fine on paper. It looks like it should be doing all right. It's been doing okay since the wild card to be fair. Um Ruth with a home game I'm always happy with. Like I think if he's at home I'm happy. If he's away I'm not happy. It's a home fixture against Finland this week so that's good. Uh, I got the Arsenal double defense against my team. Who's going to be in charge at Spurs? What kind of formation are we going to play? Are there going to be any attacking assets? Who on earth knows? The one thing I will say about Spurs is that we do most of the time score. We nearly always terrible, but we do nearly always find a way to score a goal. So, the double Arsenal defense, do I want to play them both? I mean, I probably will play them both is the reality, but I could swap out for because I've got currently got Sessi on the bench against West Ham and actually maybe if I do Snessi to Hill, which is a possible option, then maybe I want to play play them in that game. Who knows? Um, Mark Gayhee against Newcastle feels like a good pick. Again, it's a home fixture. I mean, I I don't know how he only got seven this week because he was absolutely unbelievably good. >> He's excellent. Excellent player. >> Yeah. So, so good. Uh and then the midfield is not dissimilar to yours, Rice and Enzo with Fernandez Rogers and then the difference being I've got Semeno in that final spot who's been just brilliant since I've bought. >> Talk to me about Semeno, Sam, because the reason I I'm happy you've got him. He's been outstanding and he's one of those scenarios I think you touched on it earlier as well where you talk about a player I think you said it with Hill and he went Senessi. I spoke about Seno non-stop. I liked him even when he went to City. >> Did I make that transfer? No. I >> I'm not quite sure this season what my I don't know maybe I've had a bad start. He's interrupted my my transfer thinking because he's been outstanding and it's clear that they've bought him in >> to help with the mid midfield goals because it's only Holland that scores and he's been delivering. >> Yeah. He's so you must be super happy with him in your team. >> Do you know it's funny because I w I was at the Spurs Man City game a couple of weekends back and I sat there and I watched Smeno be outstanding but also selfish. So in a way that like at Man City before it was like right get the ball find Harland get the ball find Harland whoever it is Dou in the past KDB Foden however it's been it's been like get the ball get it to the big man get it to the big man get it. Semena is not like that. And there were three moments when they were shooting towards the south where I sit where Semenya takes a shot and Han is like mate at him and Semeno is just like what? Like I'm here to >> I'm here to get the golden boot. >> Exactly. >> I'm I'm not here to mess around and feed you. I'm here to contribute to this team. I'm here to win the golden boot. And in those moments I was like and that's why I bought you in because so I I had him earlier on in the season and then I sold him when those Bourma fixers got really awful and I was like well I'll lose you then and I can't even remember who I replaced him with and I instantly regretted it and then when he went to Man City and he was getting sold on mass by a lot of players when he went to Man City and that was the week I bought him back because I was just like I'm listening to what Pep's saying and I know Pep control you but I'm listening to Pep talking about, you know, how great he's going to be and how he's here to score goals and that's why they've bought him. And I'm listening to Harlon say um he's here to challenge for the golden boot. And I'm thinking if Haron's saying that I'm more like to believe what Haron says to be fair than Pep. And he's been a great buy. And part of my thinking with him was that you said before some when you're having a terrible season, you wanna salvage it, but also at the same time, you don't want to tank it. Like I don't want to finish in the I don't want to finish at 10 million. So like I've got to find I've got to find a way to get to a respectable place like somewhere inside the top million. I do not want a million plus finish. That's disastrous. So we've got to find a way to improve. So in my head therefore you take the most heavily owned and you build around them because then they they safeguard you that there's fewer people that can kill you and Lee calls it um the it's like the pain it's killing the roots to pain he calls it >> and so like for me Harl and Smeno gay he they were roots to pain not having them if they do something same as J Pedro it's painful full. So, I've had him since he was at Man City and he's been brilliant. Um, to the point where >> I can see >> I've got my eyes on him over Harland. >> I was about to say we we normally leave captaincy to the end, but I think that's we need to discuss that. So, you've actually got it on him. I'm not I'm not sure. I've got mine on Bruno at the moment, but I don't know depending on transfers coming in. If I bring Palmer, I'd of course fully commit and go for him. So, how how locked do you reckon you're you are with Semeno? And why him over Harland? If so, mine is a bit if I bring in a Chelsea player, like if if I was to bring in Jal Pedro, which is possible, I might move the armband there because it's Burnley at home and they're awful. Um, but to be honest, with the way Man City are playing, with the selfishness of Semeno, with his effort and drive and the fitness levels and the form, I trust him and I like him more. The other thing we have to consider is obviously Harlem went off at Halime. >> Yes. Yeah, we should discuss that actually. So there's a little bit of a potential worry there around minutes and injury. Now could this be a they are very comfortable in the game doesn't need to play him. There was a little bit of anxiety around him heading into the last couple of games and whether he's been fully fit. It's the FA Cup against Sulford at the weekend. Does he need to be playing Harland? No, absolutely not. So could he just give him a bit more of a rest? Maybe perfect opportunity. It feels like that rather than an actual injury to me, but maybe it is an injury we need to watch on that. But I just trust Semeno more than I do Harland right now. Plus you have the extra points for clean sheets. Plus you have the extra points for goals. The route to points with the exception of penalties feels far greater for Semeno than it does for Harland at the minute. >> Do you think you would do it if he was say flying and having a great season? Is there a little bit of chasing as well in that or not really? You don't take that into consideration. Do you think I'm I'm asking you say if he was really having a great season? Would you just go Harland and think nope a bit of defensive here to >> Yeah, that's I think I think probably I think probably there is a a part of me that is looking and going is are there opportunities to go against the grain here because Harland's always going to be the most captain because he's so heavily owned. So in the majority of casual teams and teams that aren't necessarily active, he is going to be the captain. So his captaincy rates are always going to be much higher than everybody else's. So going against him is always risky. and and I've done it a few times of late this week with the triple captaincy on Gabrielle, which isn't going great at the minute, but you know, let's see. It >> is it is still 1-1. >> It is indeed still 1-1. Uh, which is not ideal, but it's not also terrible. Um, because there is another game to go and we'll just wait and see. But I think like the the weeks before I'd gone for Bruno and that had gone really well. I' had a couple of good returns out of Bruno. I said a couple of weeks back that I um that I thought that I thought going for Semenyu was better than Harland. And actually I had um in the game against Spurs, I captained Bruno in that one, but I had the vice captain on Semenyu rather than Harlem because I just thought if if Bruno doesn't play for any reason, I want Semenyo to be to be my captain. So >> I I think there is a I think you're right. I think there is a little bit of me that's like where can I push the boundaries? Where's the best option for looking for somebody a little bit outside of the box for the captaincy? Um it's a home game against Newcastle. Like I mean >> Newcastle been struggling as well. They've they've been struggling recently. They really have. >> They have and they weren't great against Birds. It's just that we were awful. So it's not, you know, they won the game, fair enough, but they didn't win it because they were great. They won it because we are awful. >> Um, >> so I'm less, you know, I don't think that that's a turning point for Newcastle. I do think that City comfortably win that game. I expect most of the teams to have a rest in the FA Cup and for Pep to play the youngsters or or more of a youngstery squad. Anyway, >> um, yeah, >> I was going to say Sam, so looking at your team, I can I take that wild card as a success. Green Arrows and you've managed four you've got four free transfers which is a good sign. You haven't had to panic and try to patch up your wild card team which is good. >> So who are the problematic players? You've already mentioned Pedro but who are the players in your team because it has been a couple of weeks now since he wild carded. Who are the ones you're looking at? Is DC for example one or not? >> Is he a player maybe? >> Yeah I mean the fixtures aren't great. It's Manchester United, Newcastle before Burnley which is a good fixture and then it's Arsenal. So, and then Chelsea. So, the next five weeks, there's probably one fixture I want to play him in. Part of the reason for going cover at the time was that I quite liked his rotation with Krooppy because I wanted to be able to play Creepy every week. >> Um, but obviously I wild carded before Rayanne arrived. So, I think there's a slightly different narrative around which Bournemouth attacker I would prefer to have. I'm happy to hold Krooppy that like he's not an issue. I know I'm happy to have him, but I'd rather not have if I want to go into the Bournemouth attack, which I do with the fixes that they have, I'd rather it not have to be creepy and get one point like I've had this week, which is really annoying. >> So, when I look at my team, like I want rid of Rice soon. >> Yeah, you want him to go. Yeah. >> Yeah, I've had enough of Rice. I think I appreciate that Arsenal from set pieces can be brilliant, but I just feel like that's a wasted spot at the minute for the returns that we're getting from him. I know that he picks up Defcon every now and then, but we're not seeing those massive halls that we were. And even when we look back to those massive halls, I mean, one of them is a fortunate own goal headed in. One of them is a fortunate penalty given for a hand ball. >> Um, so he's picking up the assists for those. >> All right, he's taking the corners and that's why you pick him because he's on corners and it's roots points. I get that. But they've still been fortunate to have gone in from him. So, he's one that's on the topping block as is Enzo Fernandez, but he has to stay for the Burnley game. I cannot bring myself to sell a player that's got Burnley at home. So, he's got to stay for the next week. Morgan Rogers, to be honest, uh for those of you that watch the Q&A, apologies for the rant that I'm I had earlier because he drives me insane because the underlying numbers are great and I watch the games and the eye test. It's like tick tick tick tick tick tick. Great points. No, >> like >> I mean he has I mean how many blanks has Rogers have you? Have you he been harsh there? You being harsh? Let me have a look >> on the Q&A today. We did we did um I did a look at him. So over the last six game weeks, he's top for chances create for shots with 20 of the midfielders, but he is also 18th of midfielders for points scored. >> And of those, I think he's got 27 points in that six week period. 10 of them came last week. So in five weeks he's got 17 points and that came because he got an assist a few weeks ago. Like and that came in a game where he should have hauled. I remember sitting here making FPL family graphics and thinking how have you not absolutely hauled in this match like he should have had multiple multiple goals and it was absolutely infuriating not to see him get them. Um >> but look at his fixtures though Sam surely problematic. Look at his fixtures. Surely he can't be on the transfer leads Wolves Chelsea who who can see the goal and they're competing with them for a Champions League spot and Manchester United and then West Ham. They're decent. I don't think he's a he's a major issue. I mean when you look at your team I don't think he's frustrating you. So you've mentioned him. Have you got a potential plan for him to go for someone? >> Yeah. So this is the problem is that I look at the fixture ticket and he's got no red fixtures right through to gameweek 38 when they play Man City. And by that point, title race might be over and if Man City have made the Champions League final, it might be no focus for them at all on the on on the title. So, it might even be red by that stage. And if Aston Villa is still in the hunt for European football by that point, you'd expect that to be a full focus for them. >> Um, I don't think he'll end up being a priority transfer out because I think for a lot of managers, he might actually be a priority transfer in with the fixtures that they have. So, I think he's probably one that I'll end up keeping, but he's really annoying. It's really annoying to own. It is really frustrating. Um, >> would you sell rice or Rogers first? You had to pick one to go. >> It'll be rice first. Mostly also because of the blanking 31 as well that I've got to start prep for because obviously I've got the free man city and I've got the three Arsenal. So, I got six players that I've got to shift down to >> down to at least three. So, Rice will go. So, my current thinking I the one thing that I regret about my wild card is selling for inverts. and I knew I didn't want to do it. I kept so I had him on wild card and I kept him for two weeks after the wild card and he was fantastic and he was returning me points and it were differential points and it was great. But then I had to get Bruno after Man City. >> That's the reason and that's a fair enough reason. I think that's a a valid reason actually. >> Yeah. And it was a straight it was a straight choice at that point between selling Rogers or selling Bruno. And I looked at at selling Florian and I looked at the fixtures that you have versus the fixtures that Villa had. And I was like, I have to sell Vert. And as soon as I hit go on the transfer, I regretted it. And it was one of those where I was like, I'd rather sell Enzo. I'd rather sell Rice. I'd rather sell anyone else rather than Vert. But I couldn't sell either because at that point, we didn't know which one of them was going to double. So I was like, I have to keep you both. So Vertz went, but now I want to root back to him. So he he's a priority. The Liverpool fixes are just they're too good. >> They're too good. I mean, really good. Literally, if you run the fixture sticker on scout through till the end of the season, Liverpool are top. They're the only team in there that don't have any red fixtures at all between now and the end of the season. They are they are delightful. They are really, really >> playing and he's playing really well. I mean, obviously I watch Liverpool. He's an excellent player. I mean, of course, there should be more output. Same with Ekit. Very wasteful recently, but but the team is being built on Verts to be honest. He's going to be new. It is. He didn't that's why they bought him in to phase out you know the old old team of Salah and stuff and it's going to be on him and the ball is starting to go through him so I do like him as a transfer I mean maybe it's some maybe that is something I could consider actually instead of pal mom because then I could just leave him in the team with no headache >> but um >> I do like that move. >> Okay so if I pushed if I pushed you then Sam before we finish off if I did push you on your team what move are you going to do? I gave you two options. Which move you going to do if I had to push? So, I've got four transfers. There is a chance that I'd use quite a few of them. So, if I I like rice toverts. That's the transfer I'd really like to make. I do need to find some money in order to do that. I've got 1.1 in the bank. So, in order to get up, I need a and I need loads, but I do need, >> you know, I need to find a little bit because what's um rice is 7.4. Actually, I don't I could just do that transfer straight off the bat. So, I could just go rice to birds and be done with it. Use one transfer, leave it at that. Um the other option is to go and then go up from Calvat Leuen. But the question is where do I go and a bit like you do I go for a J Pedro pick but know that it's it feels a bit >> shortterm if I'm going for Burnley really. And I'm and am I just shielding myself? >> I feel like I am. I feel like that's what I'm doing. I'm just shielding myself against pain because he's in so many teams and it that's the thing that kills my rank every week. or do I take it as a more of a long-term look and do I go for somebody like Thiago because that seems like the sensible play here. The sensible move is to go straight to Thiago. It's a home fixture against Brighton who have also been poor defensively and could easily concede a number of goals against that Brighton Brenford attack and then after that they've got Burnley. So it's not like I'm, you know, over if you look at it in a two-eek block, I'm better off to go Thiago. The little bit of me goes, you've got loads of transfers, it's going to be fine. Just get J Pedro one week and then swell in the next week for Thiago and get Burnley Burnley. But that feels really wasteful at a time where transfers are important because I don't I've used my wild card >> and with gameweek 31 not too far away and you you're stacked up like you said. I think you're right. I I I think with your team albe it's a very nice team I think you do need to your moves do need to plan >> adapt they do yeah otherwise you're in danger of because you might you might use some of these transfers in a more luxury way and then two injuries or one injury then you really are in trouble you're taking a minus minus 8 minus 4 to get you you know it's kind of undoing all the good work you've done >> I mean my plan over the next couple of weeks is for Rice and Timber to go um leave me with just Gabrielle to bench because obviously I've got a lot of value invested in Gabrielle because I've had him for a while. So keep him to the bench and then either I play through double game week 30 blank gameweek 31 with 10 and keep all three of my um city assets or I have to sell one of them. But the problem with selling one of them is I have had gay for ever for like forever since he was at palace. So I've got a lot of value in gay. Yeah. >> So if I sell him, buying him back's difficult. Seno's gone up since I bought him. It's got value sitting in him as well. Got 2 in him. So don't really want Could I could I sell the big man? Like Well, let's see where we are. But you know, he's gone. I got point4 in him. So >> yeah, >> in terms of owning these city assets back, I do feel like I'm going to be 10. I'm going to be 10 men, I think, for the blank. So Rice and Timber are the priority sales. Enzo's a priority after Burnley. I think after Burnley, I'll go Enzo to Rayan. That feels like the move I'm going to make. I'll take a little downgrade there. That'll give me a bit more. >> He does look good. I mean, I didn't know much about him before. He does look really good. I was watching the extended highlights of him. My goodness. >> The habit of this. How do they do it? They pick up these players. >> Good scouting and and then they put him in they put him in a good platform to be able to express themselves. >> They'll be getting 60 million from probably Spurs. in the summer. Probably, but probably offer him 100 million. You know, we're >> Yeah, probably he he could be the one for for for next season. >> Cool. Thank you for that. I think >> was there anything else that we've missed in my team or your teams? Anything else you wanted to run through? >> I don't think so. I mean, look, Mo, our teams look like they should be getting green arrows. They should be getting green arrows. >> This season is coming. >> This season, that's not cutting it, Sam. I'm going to be honest with you. Maybe hopefully for you, I I'll wish for you. But I've already um accepted it. I'm going to try. I never give up. I'll play right to the end. But but in my mind, I'm like every week I go into it now. Like yesterday when Keane came on, I did have a chuckle. I was like, \"Yeah, come on.\" Like 93rd minute. Come on. You know, it's just one of those seasons. >> You got to laugh or you cry. >> Exactly that. But as I said, I'll be coming and crying of you as one day anyway because I need that. I need that therapy. It's a safe space. >> It's a safe space. I know in Port as is u being been being in the the mixer as well. So Sam, thank you very much for joining me on Early Thoughts. How was it? >> It's great. Can I I'll come back next time PR is uh unavailable. You know where I am. Give me a shout. >> Pra, thank you Sam. You've been a breath of fresh air every time. So listen, every uh international break, every uh FA Cup, Praz is first class obviously around the world and then so so you can come, >> you pick up the phone, I'll come as interim manager for the week. >> He's going to give me so much stick when he hears this, you know, which is why you say that for >> he's going to refuse to come back. He'll be like, \"Right, if you're going to be abusive to me, Mo, I'm out of here.\" >> No. No. It'll be >> We love you. >> Exactly. It'll be fine. Listen, if you're still listening and enjoyed it, please like, leave a nice comment for Sam. Tell me what you think of Sam's team in the comments. And um >> not Spurs. Don't tell me about them. They're terrible. >> Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry about Spurs. We know. >> I'm not going to say they could get relegated now. I don't want to rub. >> We know that, Mo. We know that. >> No. No. We're going to leave that. So, but yes, we will see you. I'll be back next week with Praz for final thoughts and um we see Sam again soon. So, thank you very much. Take it easy to buy from me >> and bye from me."
