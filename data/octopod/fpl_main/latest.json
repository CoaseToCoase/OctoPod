      "transcript": "It's time for your Gameweek 27 transfer tips. One player you should buy, one you should sell, one you should keep, and one you should avoid by Thiago. And whilst the league's second top goal scorer has disappointed in some recent tough fixtures, one thing is certain. Good fixtures breed good form. And you know what? I don't even think Thiago has been playing badly, he's just been a bit unfortunate with fixtures and not getting as much service as he needs. He had the best chances of the game in a tough performance uh and an excellent performance really against Arsenal. And with Bryson, Burnley, Bournemouth, Wolves, leads and Everton in the next six, I think that changes. He's playing some of the very weakest defenses in the league, in particular against teams that concede a lot of chances from central areas from strikers. So whilst the unengaged FPL managers will simply look at points and say Thiago is not worth it, those in the no will snap him up whilst his stock is low, buy the dip and reap the rewards. Cell Tarovski. Now, unfortunately, Everton just have a pretty tragic run of games. Now, they face Man United, Newcastle away. Burnley, Arsenal, Chelsea, Brenford, and Liverpool in the next run. Outside of that Burnley game, Tarovski isn't really playable. And for 5.7 million, you can't really be benching him for six out of seven game weeks. That's just a poor use of budget. Maybe he could be forgiven if he was still getting defensive contributions or Pigford was still bailing his team out for clean sheets. But it seems the points have dried up and pretty much any Everton defender or indeed goalkeeper can be sold. Keep Enzo. This guy went from scamming points to dodging them within the space of two weeks. Back-to-back blanks may fool you into thinking that Enzo is no longer involved in the attack, but it's just not true. In fact, during this twoame week period, if you take away the penalties, no Chelsea player has generated more expected goal involvements than Enzo. That means he's putting up better numbers than Joel Pedro. And he's putting up better non-penalty numbers than even Palmer, which means if there are no penalties against Burnley, which I wouldn't hold my breath on, by the way, Enzo is just as good as the more fashionable Chelsea attackers right now. Avoid Joel Pedro. Now, I cannot stress this enough. If you already have Joel Pedro, you should 100% keep him. You should maybe even think about captaining him. But if you haven't bought him yet, you're kind of too late at this point. Burnley at home this week is a great fixture. And I think he will get points here. But after that, he faces Arsenal away, Villa away, Newcastle, Everton, Man City, Man United. This is the worst run of fixtures of any team in the Premier League after Gameweek 27 for Chelsea. And whilst he has thrived against some weaker oppositions and scammed three penalty assists in uh two games from dumb opponents pushing him over beyond gameweek 27, you're probably going to want to sell him anyway. So the real question is if you're only just buying him now, is it worth two transfers? One to buy him this week and another to sell him next week. So congratulations genuinely to those who had the foresight to bring him in early. But for those only thinking about it now, I think you missed the boat. Make sure to drop a like and follow for more FPL tips."

      "transcript": "I asked 100 FPL experts for their gameweek 27 transfer moves, captains, and chip strategies so you guys can follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Welcome to FPL, mate. My name is Dan. We are back with another experts video for gameweek 27. A massive shout out to all of our experts who volunteered their data for this new gameweek. Um, it's going to be an interesting one, particularly for captains, as you will soon see in this video, guys. So, uh, stay tuned for that. lots to discuss. So, let's start off with the transfers and chips. And whilst there are some transfers being made, actually the majority of our experts will be rolling this week. But given that it is kind of roughly almost 50/50, I don't think I lean one particular way. If you need to make transfers, you need to make transfers. But if you can afford to roll, you will be in the company of 54% of expert managers, which is also pretty good company to be in. But 33% of our experts will be making one transfer this game week. Just the one. 12% will be making two. and just 1% making three transfers in game read 27. Not any of our wild our experts are on a wild card or a free hit. So don't even think about it. No trends there. And in terms of chips generally speaking, no bench boost. We have two using the triple captain chip. And we'll reveal who our experts are using that triple captain chip on later on in the video. But um yeah, it is a maybe a a small opportunity for triple captain if you do really want to and if you didn't use it last week on Gabrielle. But it's by no means something that you need to do. There are going to be hopefully some more opportunities in future gameweeks. And of course, if you haven't checked out my uh my chip strategy video from yesterday, I definitely recommend checking that one out if you want kind of more information on what your options are in terms of those remaining chips. Let's check out the global trends in the FPL world. What are the overall player base up to? And do our experts agree? Well, one player they certainly do agree on, and that is that Thiago is going to be a good transfer in. Now the transfer numbers in general are not super high among the overall player base this gameweek. So that maybe suggests that either some people are waiting so I don't know how these trends will end up going but outside of Thiago Palmer Semeno Hill Virgil and Ryan are all players that our experts are somewhat interested in. Rogers and Bruno are pretty highly owned among experts. So line not so much but none of these players see new interest among experts. But the headline here, guys, is that Joah Pedro, the most popular transfer in in the overall player base. Our experts are just not interested in bringing this player in at all. Now, granted, a few of our experts do own him already. He's owned by around 19% of experts right now, but uh yeah, no one's really bringing him in. So, if you don't already have Joel Pedro, it genuinely might be a little bit too late for that one to be totally honest with you guys. Only one good fixture left. And if you're not going to captain him, he's probably not worth buying to be honest. But if you already have him, obviously that's amazing. But just to let you know guys, whilst the overall player base love Joel Pedro as a new transfer in this week, the experts simply do not. Let's check out who they are transferring out before we look at the transfers in. And it is Declan Rice that is seeing the largest volume of transfers out. Now, of course, he is massively owned by experts and 86% had him for his double gameweek in 26 and that will be dropping down to 70% ahead of his non-double gameweek in gameweek 27. Certainly with Declan Rice looking to blank in gameweek 31, there will be, you know, generally with Arsenal and maybe Wolves players, we are going to see them start to trend downwards over the coming weeks as we build towards that blank game week. But certainly Rice is not a must-sell player. The majority of experts will be keeping him, but if you do have a midfielder in mind that you'd like to bring in this week, he's certainly a player that could be sacrificed. Bruno G with his long-term injury is being transferred out by all of his current owners in the the world of FPL experts, I suppose. Evan Nilson, four transfers out for him, slashing his ownership almost in half. So, definitely a player losing popularity after a few blanks. Euran Timber with a few transfers out here as well. Mané, Tarovski, Harland, three transfers out each. A lot of our our experts are waiting on the injury status on Harland and we may see some more transfers out for him if Harland is indeed injured out for this gameweek, but we'll have to wait and see on that one. We're still waiting for press conferences, so difficult to give an accurate answer on that one, but a lot of the experts did kind of say, you know, if Harland is going to be out, then maybe that changes things. But right now, only a few planned transfers out for him. A couple of transfers out for the likes of Kuna, Doru, and Mark Guu. And one thing in particular, I think players like Mark U and Mane, that third cheap forward position, we're going to start to see more and more of these third cheap forward slots kind of being transferred out in upcoming gameweeks as uh a lot of people look towards building a solid 11 players for gameweek 31. and players like Mark U Mané just are not going to cut the mustard in game 31 unfortunately alongside a lot of those Arsenal Man City and Crystal Palace players which I expect all of whom to start to trend downwards but no clear patterns in terms of transfers out this game week. Maybe we've got some better ideas for transfers in. But before we have a look guys, make sure you do drop a like on the video. It massively helps out and do feel free to subscribe as well. We are shooting for 250,000 subscribers by the summer. Let's see if you we can do it if you haven't subscribed already. It really helps you guys receive these videos in your algorithm if they are the kind of thing you like. Let's check out transfers in among experts. And yeah, there are two players who both play for the same team that are super popular right now. And I think whilst for a lot of players the best jumping on point might actually be next game week, gameweek 28, where we might see a lot more transfers, a lot more variety of transfers. For this gameweek 27, it's actually a pretty good jumping on point for Brenford players because their good fixtures really do start now. And that's why we see Thiago and Dango as the two most popular transfers in among experts this week. Thiago kind of expected to see this 13 transfers in and he is the number one most transferred in uh player among experts and that's despite 42% of experts already owning him. So he is going to increase and increase. He's going to go to over half of experts are going to have him in their team. So be aware of that one guys. And Dango is a little bit more interesting because he's a he's a differential. Like there's no other way of saying it. Very few people had Dango before this game week, but now the fixtures are turning very, very good. I think more experts are going to be bringing him in this week. 11 new transfers in for the cheap 5.8 million Brenford midfielder. Not too bad. There are some uh transfers in for Palmer and I think a lot of that is to do with targeting captaincy for Palmer against Burnley this game week. So, pretty interesting one there, guys. Yeah, six new transfers in in addition to his 10 old owners, I guess. So, there'll be 16% of experts will have Palmer in their team ahead of this new gameweek with a few, I imagine, selling him the week after that. But, we'll have to wait and see on that one. That's for next uh next episode, for next week. Hill. Finally, we are continuing to see Hill uh appreciated by the masses. Five new transfers in for him in addition to the 17% of experts who had him last week. Uh just a cheap beast in the world of FPL right now. Five new transfers in for Virgil as well. So, you know, significant interest there. Semeno with a few more transfers in. He is going to be in around a quarter of expert teams by the time we hit deadline this week. Ryan differential, three new transfers in for him. Same with Shardai. We're seeing a few differential transfers in this gameweek to be fair among experts. Pretty exciting stuff. Um, yeah, Ryan is just looks really good right now, but you know, we don't know too much about him, but what we've seen so far, it looks good and he's very cheap. Sharda may be an alternative to Dango, but it does seem that to be that the experts do prefer Dango to Sharda. Um, mostly going to be because of that cheaper price tag for a similar kind of result. Couple of transfers in for Rogers and Verts, but nothing too interesting to say there. Don't think two transfers really counts as a expert trend and that's what this video is all about. Checking out the template guys. No change on the goalkeepers, not too much change on the defenders, but Timber has dropped in ownership a little bit and Hill now enters the template due to his five new owners. He's up to 22% and that is going to allow him to leaprog Alderete as the fifth most popular defender among experts. In midfield, no change in terms of the personnel here. Rice receives a significant drop, but no individual midfielder has gained enough traction this gameweek to enter into the into the template in the top five popular midfielders here. So, there you go. Um, interestingly, no one's selling Enzo. I know Enzo is a pretty popular cell this game week for some reason, but none of our experts are selling him. Everyone's keeping him. And in terms of those forwards, a little drop for Harland, decent increase for Thiago to be fair, and a small increase even for Ech. So I think we are going to see this uh front three become really the expert template. Harland, Thiago, Ekit. I think a lot of experts will be looking to roll and rock with this front three for the upcoming gamewigs. Difficult to say average current ranks and scores because I'm recording this before the Arsenal game, but so far no good. After the Arsenal game, hopefully our experts will be seeing certainly a few more green arrows in there. We'll have to wait and see for that one. So, can't really um judge that too much. But you guys will be watching this video after the Arsenal game has finished. So, let me know what were your final scores in gameweek 26. Did you get on well or you know, was it a little bit of a struggle all the way to the finish line of the gameweek? Based on all of that guys, I think we can make some rough suggested transfers. I think certainly if you are selling Declan Rice going for either Dango if you don't have the budget or if you want to go for a oneweek punt captain shout then moving Rice to to Palmer if you have the money could also work pretty well. I've seen a few people doing Rice to Semeno as well. So those are the kind of midfield options that you kind of got going on that are kind of supported by our expert data this week. But if you do want to go for some other positions, for example, if you were to bring in Thiago, you might be looking to sell someone like uh Evan Nilson. But if you have a cheaper forward like Mane or Marku, maybe that is going to be another way. Or even Obi and maybe that's going to be another way of getting uh Thiago in if you do have the money in your back pocket. If you are looking for a new defender, Hill and Virgil seem to be the most popular guys. So maybe something like a a a Tarovski to Hill if you want to free up some budget could work. Doo to Hill would work as well if you still have him in your squad. And finally for captains, guys, and we have a right old variety here. Wow. With nine different captains being selected by our experts, this is one of the widest arrays of genuine captain options we've seen all season because we actually have a few trends here as well. It's not just a whole bunch of players being captained by one uh expert each. We've got a couple of trends here which is nice. So, first of all, let's talk about Harland. Now, 55% of our experts said that they will be captaining Harland this gameweek. That accounts for 59% of his ownership. A lot of them did kind of say that if Harland is unavailable for this week then they'll be captaining Bruno Fernandez if they have him or maybe Joel Pedro if they have him. One of the other guys basically in the top four if Harland is unavailable. But certainly we are seeing a case where if Harland is available at home against Newcastle the majority of experts will be going this direction for their captaincy. But at 55% or 59% of owners that is far from conclusive and actually there is a lot of experts almost half of experts going a very different direction in terms of their captaincy list. So let's talk about Bruno Fernandez first of all 16 of our experts will be captaining him but out of 96 owners and by the way Bruno is kind of the most popular um FBL asset now pretty much I think outside of Gabrielle who is actually no Bruno is is slightly ahead of Gabrielle. So Bruno is the most popular player among experts right now. So actually even though we do see 16 captains from him as a percentage of his ownership, it's not crazy high. I mean it is a trend, don't get me wrong. It's certainly something to be considered. But what's really interesting is if you're not going for Harland and you have some of these Chelsea players, Palmer Jal Pedro. So let's talk about Palmer. First of all, at home against Burnley, he is owned by 16% of our experts and 12 of them will be captaining him, which means Palmer has a captaincy rate among owners of 75%. Which means to me, it's pretty obvious if you have Palmer, the experts think you should captain him. Pretty simple, right? And even the triple captains, the two triple captains being used in this gameweek among experts are both being used on Cole Palmer against Burnley because we know it's the best fixture of the season. We know Palmer has that ability to score those crazy points. Not saying it's guaranteed that it will happen, but he has that in his locker to get that 20 point plus haul in there. So, it is a consideration to triple captain. I don't think we need to take it too seriously just because we're not seeing any real strong trends towards it and there will be other options. But I think if you do have Palmer, he is definitely captain material. And even Joah Pedro here, of course, 59% of Harland owners will be captaining him, but 47% of Joel Pedro owners will be captaining him, which is definitely worth taking note of. So nine out of the 19 Joel Pedro owners that are part of our expert group will be captaining him as well. Interesting stuff. Three captains for Enzo. Not really too much here, but it's worth at least having a little look at. Echk with two captains here as well, which I thought was interesting. Didn't expect to see that, but here we are. And a little bit lower than that, we got some kind of one-off captains from individual experts. Um, two targeting that Crystal Palace versus Wolves game, one on S, one on Mos, and one of our experts even captaining Semeno against Newcastle. And considering Semeno's form, I can't say I totally blame them. If you like Harland, kind of have to like Semanuel as well. And let's wrap up with some bonus questions, guys. First of all, uh I asked our experts in the private Discord channel. Are Chelsea players still worth buying with only one good fixture remaining? And both of these questions are kind of related to buying players. Chelsea and Man City players, Chelsea because they literally only have one good fixture and then they have terrible fixtures after Burnley. And also we asked about Man City because um they have decent fixtures in the short term, but we're expecting them to blank in gameweek 31. So let's start off with Chelsea. Um 13% said yes, it's what it's still worth the risk going for a Chelsea player. 31% said yes, but only if you have a lot of spare free transfers so you can remove them again afterwards. And we saw 56% of our experts said the majority view is actually it is just too late to buy Chelsea players. No one is worth considering anymore. Move on. target the next uh the next players with the nice runner fixtures. So yeah, if you are wondering about whether you should buy Chelsea players or not, um the majority of our experts say no, don't even bother going there. Just ignore them now. But there is still 31% I think that's a decent chunk. Uh you know, if you include the 13% as well, there's still a decent chunk saying that if you do have some spare free transfers, then maybe you could go for it. So leave that with you guys. If you wanted the experts opinion on that one though, that is it. Um, as for Man City players, very, very different results. And I think that's because Man City genuinely do have a lot of good fixtures coming up. So, it's not so much of a oneweek punt. It's more like a four week punt before you're going to have to transfer these guys back out again, which is uh far more significant than one week, isn't it? Four times more significant. In fact, ah, we do love data on this channel. But anyway, should you buy Man City players? Are they still worth buying even with an upcoming blank? Uh, 25% said yes. It is still worth the risk no matter what, even with just one transfer. But 75%, the vast majority said that yes, it is only worth it if you have many free transfers to depend on taking them back out later essentially. Um outside of that, no one, you know, said, you know, it's too late or anything like that. So our experts are still on board with potentially buying Man City players if you want to. So um hopefully that maybe clears up some questions that you guys have. The bonus questions are there just to answer some of those additional questions and kind of give a nice uh idea on what the majority of experts are saying. So hopefully there was loads of good stuff in today's video. I certainly thought there was. Let me know guys who you will be captaining and which players you're thinking about transferring in and out. Are you going different from the experts or are they going to do something pretty similar? Let me know your ranks as well. Do drop a like, subscribe, and uh check out the chip strategy video from yesterday, guys. Honestly, it's a banger. is going to tell you everything you need to know about doubles, blanks, and the chips. Um, check it out and I'll see you later, mates."

      "transcript": "We have new information about the double and blank game weeks coming up soon. So today I'm going to share everything we know right now as well as the best chip strategies to succeed in FPL. Welcome to FPL mate. My name is Dan and it's going to be another super important fixture changes and chip strategy video today. If you've already used your wild card, this is going to be a crucial video for you to watch as there are things you need to be doing and thinking about right now. now. And if you've still got your wild card in hand, I think you're going to like what you see today. We're going to go through all of the upcoming double and blank game weeks, which teams are most likely to double when and against who, and we're going to look at three different chip strategies to best take advantage of the situation that we find ourselves in. And the situation, by the way, is maximum chaos. The planning has well and truly begun, and I really think by the end of this video, you guys are going to feel so much smarter. Um, a lot of nerding out has come into this video over the past couple of days. So much so, I need to put on the nerd glasses for this video. So, let's start right here, guys. The most important game you need to remember between now and the end of the season. And we're going to take these off so we can actually read correctly. But basically, between now and gameweek 13, we have no interesting weeks, no doubles, no blanks. Gameweek 31 is a blank gameweek as things currently stand. Arsenal, Wolves, Man City, and Crystal Palace will have no fixture in gameweek 31, but this may actually change. Gameweek 32 is likely to be a normal gameweek and uh gameweek 33 is going to be the largest double gameweek of the season. A maximum of 10 teams can double here. But the most likely outcome is that we see eight teams doubling. There's also a small chance of only six teams doubling here, though. Uh anything less than six is pretty unlikely at this point. So, it's going to be a big double, the biggest of the season, bigger than anything else we'll see. Uh, I've had a few comments from people asking about free hitting in blank gameweek 31. But if you think you're going to have a depleted squad in gameweek 31, wait until you hear about its big brother. Yes, gameweek 34 will be the biggest blank gameweek of the season with a maximum of eight teams with no fixture whatsoever. So, if you don't have a plan for gameweek 34, I don't know how to put this lightly, but you could be screwed. Uh this gameweek 33 to gameweek 34 pair of weekends could make or break seasons. But anyway, gameweek 35 is probably going to be normal. Gameweek 36 is the second best chance of a double gameweek this season with a maximum of four teams doubling. Two teams doubling here is perhaps more likely, but honestly based on current information, I would say that there's actually a less than 50% chance of any teams doubling in this gaming. So, there is a possibility, but it's not like uh more likely than not, if that makes sense. Uh, in fact, outside of gameweek 33, there is a very fair possibility that we will see zero other double gameweeks this season. So, be aware of that when you're planning your chips out. Gameweek 37 I previously had as a possible double and a possible blank. Uh, blanks here are now impossible because it would require a team to reach both the final of the FA Cup and the final of the Europa League. And since Aston Villa and Forest are out of the FA Cup, this is no longer going to be possible. Uh doubles are still technically possible in 37, but I don't think it's that likely. Certainly not likely enough to warrant spending too much time talking about it right now. Um FA Cup finalists will most likely have their fixtures moved from the weekend of Gameweek 37 to the midweek of gameweek 37, keeping the fixtures within the same gameweek. And there should be plenty of other midweek slots to schedule any other fixtures or unscheduled fixtures. So gameweek 37, I don't think it's really going to be needed this season. So that's the general landscape. Small blank gameweek in 31, big double gameweek in 33, big blank in 34, and a possible small double in gameweek 36. And loads of other kind of fringe possibilities that are, I guess, not likely enough to justify talking about in this YouTube video. I could go on and on about all of the possibilities, but I want to keep this simple and useful. But if you do have any questions or ideas about the other possibilities, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll be more than happy to reply to anyone who is maybe nerding out even more on all of the possibilities and we can have a chat about that because I have looked through it. I just don't think it's super relevant to talk about today. With that said, guys, we need to move on to which specific teams are going to uh double and blank and when that is likely to be. As we mentioned, nothing interesting is likely to happen between now and gameweek 30. So, let's race ahead to gameweek 31 where the fun really begins. The gameweek 31 to gameweek 38 period is what I like to call chip season, and you'll soon see why. So, let's start off with the basics. The most likely situation uh will be that the uh basically any teams that reach the FA Cup semifinals will have their fixture moved from gameweek 34 to gameweek 33. So let's take an example. Say uh let's say Arsenal reach the FA Cup semi-finals. And yes, um the choice of team Arsenal is maybe a little bit biased on my part, but if Arsenal reach the FA Cup semi-finals, they will have their gameweek 34 fixture against Newcastle in theory moved into gameweek 33. This will create a double gameweek for themselves and their opponent Newcastle in gameweek 33 and a blank uh gameweek for themselves and Newcastle in gameweek 34. Nice and easy stuff so far. So now let's say that four teams, four Premier League teams, they all reach the FA Cup semi-finals. Let's just choose Arsenal, Man City, Liverpool, and Chelsea again as an example. And now we can see all of these teams and their opponents, Newcastle, Burnley, Crystal Palace, and Brighton all doubling in 33 but blanking in 34. If we see less Premier League teams reach the semi-finals, then that means less less fixtures have a chance to be moved. And if two teams reach the semi-finals who already play against each other, so for example, if both Arsenal and Newcastle reach the semi-finals, because they already play each other in gameweek 34, that is one less fixture that will need to be moved from 34 into 33. All of this would create a scenario where the teams who double in 33 are the exact same teams who blank in 34. Now, this is super important because it means that the double gameweek players that you will desperately want in your squad in gameweek 33, these are going to be the exact same players who you will want nowhere near your squad in gameweek 34, at least in an ideal world. Your ideal gameweek 33 squad will be the complete opposite of your ideal gameweek 34 squad. And the only way to transition between one FPL team to another FPL team uh entirely different for the following week is going to be by using a chip. So with that said, at the absolute minimum, you will need to save one of your free hit or wild card for the gameweek 33 to gameweek 34 transition. If you've already used your wild card, don't even think about touching that free hit chip until the gameweek 33 to 34 transition. you know who you are. You've got your finger wandering around that free hit button. Save it. You got to save it. Um and of course vice versa. If you have already used your free hit, you're going to have to save your wild card. Um if you've used both of your wild card and free hit by the time gameweek 33 and 34 come around, there's no real way of uh kind of sugar coating this. Um you will drop down in the ranks. Um wellprepared FPL managers will thrive in this moment. and the impatient or unaware uh FPL managers will kind of be punished. Uh which is why watching videos like this is is so important.

So, guys, we do put a lot of work into these videos. We make sure that we understand everything that's going on. So, one, we can ensure that you guys have all of this information in as much detail as possible before anyone else. Um, before kind of other creators are kind of either using other people's uh calendars or whatever. um we try and get ahead of the game here and we try and understand it and a lot of work does go into it. So yeah, all support appreciated, likes, subscribes, this that and the other. That was a pretty shameless plug, right guys? But uh let's get back on topic. It's got to be done in the world of YouTube. So looking at this guys, uh these fixtures on screen are just hypotheticals to explain the kind of process we're going to be going through today. Um and we need to deal with the real situation now. So here's the latest. the FA Cup. A fifth round fixtures have been drawn. Uh Fulham versus Southampton, Bristol or Port Veil versus Sunderland, Newcastle versus Man City, Leeds versus Norwich, Mansfield versus Arsenal. Yes, Wolves versus Liverpool, Rexon versus Chelsea, and West Ham versus Brenford. Uh three of these games are all Premier League affairs. Liverpool, you would say, should be Wolves. West Ham versus Brenford is maybe a little tougher to call. and Newcastle versus Man City is the standout difficult fixture for both teams. Every other Premier League team faces a team in a lower division. Arsenal and Chelsea in particular, you would expect to qualify from this round and reach the quarterfinals at the very least. So, any Premier League team that wins here and then wins again in the following round can blank in gameweek 34 and double in gameweek 33 as uh along with their kind of previously scheduled gameweek 34 opponents. So that's where we're at. Nine teams are out of the FA Cup from the Premier League. Aston Villa, Bournemouth, Brighton, Burnley, Crystal Palace, Everton, Man United, Forest, and Spurs. But here's where things get a little bit interesting. Every single one of these teams, whether they are still in the FA Cup or not, still have a chance of getting that famous gameweek 33 double and Gameweek 34 blank. And this is the reason why. So, here we are back at the Gaming 34 fixtures that will be required to move should one of the participants of the fixture reach the FA Cup semifinals. And what you'll notice is that every single fixture here has a team still in the FA Cup. And outside of Arsenal versus Newcastle, every fixture is between one team who is still in the competition and another team who is out of the competition. This means so long as one of Arsenal or Newcastle get knocked out before the semi-finals, we have the opportunity to get at least eight doubles and eight blanks. Um, it's the maximum chaos situation, bigger and more extreme than last season, which makes chip planning more crucial this year than it was last year. If both Man City and and Liverpool are knocked out, I even think we have a high chance of that 10 team doubling. Uh 10 teams doubling in gaming 30 sorry. There is a a real real chance of that happening. So um that is going to be a story for another time. But one more note from here because Wolves play Liverpool and West Ham play Brenford in the next FA Cup round. That means that we will have two fixtures confirmed as nonblanks by gameweek 30. One of Wolves versus Spurs or Liverpool versus Palace will definitely go ahead and one of West Ham versus Everton and Man United versus Brenford will definitely go ahead. We'll cover this when we do the next fixtures and chip strategy video which is going to be ahead of Gameweek 30. So stay tuned for that one. So what are the chances of these uh Gameweek 34 fixtures being moved? Well, uh here are the odds. Uh these odds were taken from FBL Spaceman's 100,000 FA Cup simulations. Very good work from him. I think these are probably the most accurate odds that we have available right now, which is why we we're kind of using them. H and when we're particularly when we're trying to figure out the likeliness of teams reaching the FA Cup semi-finals and therefore having their fixtures moved. So, let's start at the top. Arsenal versus Newcastle is by far the best candidate for a blank gameweek in 34 and a indeed a gameweek 33 double created from that blank. So, not only do Arsenal have a favorable round of 16 fixture in the FA Cup, um which should help them qualify to the next round at the least, but Newcastle are still in the tournament as well, which means there are two teams and therefore two opportunities um to create a situation where this fixture has to be moved. One if Arsenal reach the semis, the other if Newcastle reach the semis. Every other fix fixture here relies on just one team to go all the way to the semis. Chelsea here have a 48% chance of reaching the semis. Uh this gives uh a near 50/50 chance of this being moved. Liverpool versus Palace is at 47% so pretty close too. Burnley versus Man City is down just 40% maybe a little less than you expected. And that's mostly because Man City have a tough fifth round fixture against Newcastle. Um which is really important because if City fail to reach the FA Cup semi-finals and they have a big blockade in Newcastle before they get there. um you know and and this fixture does end up going ahead in gameweek 34 because City don't reach the semi-finals. It massively damages the possibility of a second double gameweek in gameweek 36. So as things stand, gameweek 36 is really on the ropes here. We got Fulham versus Aston Villa at 35% chance of being moved. Bournemouth versus Leads at 34%. Man United versus Brenford 27%. Um I would personally love to see Man United double by the way. So, I'll be cheering on Brenford to reach the semi-finals. Sunderland vs. Forest is at 25% chance to be moved. West Ham versus Everton 18%. And since Wolves need to conquer both Liverpool and another team to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, they have a measly 9% chance to blank in gameweek 34 and have their fixture moved. So, based on this data, we can project 7.24 teams to have their fixtures moved. And it doesn't automatically mean that they will be all moved out of 34 into 33, but it gives us a real nice rough idea on what's possible. So that lands us here on the fixture calendar. Arsenal versus Newcastle, the prime candidate for blanks and doubles. Chelsea, Brighton, Liverpool, Palace City, and Burnley a little further behind with odds between 40 and 50% before we factor anything else in. And anything else is really just guesswork at this point. Most crucially at this moment, every single Premier League team has a chance, at least a chance, of a gameweek 33 double and a gameweek 34 blank. Though some clearly have a better chance than others. So, what's next? I'm very glad you asked, assuming you did. Uh, you may remember that Arsenal and Wolves had their gameweek 31 fixture moved to gameweek 26 due to the clash with the League Cup final. But what about fellow finalist Man City and their previously scheduled Gameweek 31 opponent, Crystal Palace? Where does this one go? Well, there are a few possibilities. Now, the first possibility requires us to address the elephant in the room. Um, so whilst there are plenty of of of like really obvious and kind of empty midweek slots to put these unscheduled Premier League fixes in, if a team isn't in a particular tournament that plays in the midweek or indeed the weekend, they could technically play there instead. So, if a team kind of needs to have their fixture move out of gameweek 34, for example, but for whatever reason gameweek 33 doesn't work, maybe there's a TV deal clash or, you know, there's a a tight turnaround between fixes. I don't know, there could be a bunch of reasons. Um, but that would mean that there's a small chance, small but nonzero chance that a fixture is moved to somewhere other than gameweek 33. I mean, uh, if a team and their opponent isn't in, uh, a European semi-final, they could even have their game stay within gameweek 34 and simply move to the midweek, um, and not blank at all. So, there are possibilities in which teams reach the FA Cup semi-final and still don't blank in 34. Yeah, again, small chances of these these things happening. Um, I don't think it's really very likely without a strong reason, but we do have to acknowledge the possibility at the very least. And that brings us to Man City versus Crystal Palace. Currently, this game is homeless. H But if Man City are knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle, it could go on the weekend of the kind of the the 3rd to the 6th of April. If Man City and Palace are both knocked out of Europe before the quarterfinals, then the fixture could be moved to the midweek between the 7th and 9th of April. Both of those slots are technically within gameweek 31, which would mean neither team would blank in gameweek 31 after all. They would simply have their fixture rescheduled back into gameweek 31, but just at a much much later on point uh which would be a very bizarre gameweek that would straddle an international break. Now, even if those uh they you know these teams are knocked out of their their competitions, Man City out of the FA Cup, both teams out of Europe, that doesn't automatically mean this fixture would go into or back into gameweek 31, but it is would therefore be possible for that to happen. So, there is still a small chance that Man City and Crystal Palace um have that that small chance of a fixture in gameweek 31 after all. So, they will unblank themselves if you like. Um I am guessing here because you know there's so many factors at play. A lot of them are nothing to do with with fixtures and results. Um so you can't really project what the uh what the Premier League might be thinking for example. So I am guessing. But on current information I would give this maybe a 10% chance of happening of both Man City and Crystal Palace actually having a fixture within gaming 31 after all. Um, but the next option is a little bit more obvious and that involves simply putting this fixture in the wide openen gameweek 36 midweek slot. There's no other competitions being played at this time which would mean the Premier League don't have to factor anything in. No TV TV deals, no clashes with Europe, no worries about, you know, competition or upsetting other competitions or anything like that. Really, really simple and elegant solution to the problem. Then we have gameweek 33. Now, if both Man City and Liverpool are out of the FA Cup, that leaves gameweek 33 wide open for both teams to play each other instead uh in here. So, um this could create the the kind of 10 team double gameweek scenario we mentioned earlier, but it would require both Man City and Liverpool to be out of the FA Cup um before the semi-finals. So, I don't know how likely that is. probably not very, but uh you know, stranger things have happened and it would open up a really interesting 10 team double gameweek. And indeed, even if one or both of Man City and Liverpool do reach the FA Cup semi-finals, the Premier League could just decide they want to prioritize rescheduling the gameweek 31 fixture before the Gameweek 34 fixtures. Um so that would kind of boost boost boot I guess any fixture that needs to be rescheduled from the FA Cups semis later into Gameweek 36. So, kind of things would just be pushed down the line a little bit. Um, kind of a knock-on effect. So, if just one of Man City and Liverpool reached the semi-finals and the other doesn't, I don't really see any real reason why this couldn't happen. And actually, it's it's Man City versus Crystal Palace that goes into game week 30 uh 33. I'm getting mixed up weeks now. Yeah, in game week 33. And actually it's the whatever it is whether it's a kind of Liverpool versus Crystal Palace or um Man City versus Burnley could actually end up being shoved later on into gameweek 36. So that's a very real possibility as well. Um that could [clears throat] very well happen. Um so that's a whole bunch of different possibilities without me even mentioning some of the less likely possibilities. But what it leaves us with is actually Man City and Palace with the highest chance of a double in gameweek 33 because they have multiple ways of kind of getting that double gameweek of requiring that double gameweek in 33. It opens up a few niche possibilities for gameweek 36. Though I really wouldn't hold my breath on a gameweek 36 double. It is still got a very good chance of happening, but it is so far from certain. There are some different possibilities that could happen in there. and it gives us a double and blank fixture calendar. Um, the first that I've seen anywhere on the internet of a double and blank uh game calendar. I'm sure other people will start to put some out in the near future. But yeah, I think this is the the best and most accurate calendar that I've seen anywhere on the internet. And hopefully this is going to be really useful for you guys if you do want to start planning ahead a little bit. And that's exactly what we're going to be doing right now when we talk about the trips next. All right guys, the nerding out must continue. And just a reminder guys, if you haven't liked the video yet, please do. Here are three chip strategy ideas that I have come up with based on the currently available information. Now, these things, these chip strategies may change a little bit as we get more information. And we are going to get more information before the Gameweek 30 deadline. And we're going to have a lot of things actually confirmed by Gameweek 32 as well. when we have more details and we can start to narrow down or all of the kind of guess work that we're doing at the moment and start to get a more accurate uh because with each chip strategy video we do things become more and more and more accurate. Um but it does take some time to get the the you know the the the perfect result if you like. Um so yeah strategies may change some strategies may become stronger some may become weaker. Um but we got to consider everything. Um, just to let you know guys, we will be able to make a much more accurate uh kind of double and blank gameweek prediction before the gameweek 30 deadline. And we will be making another video for gameweek 30 uh around chip strategies and stuff. Uh, those who don't have a wild card, you should probably be like 90% decided on your chip strategy by this point. Um, if you do have a wild card, you can be a little bit more flexible and you can actually wait until before the gameweek 32 deadline um before committing fully sending a chip strategy. Um, so that's good. Um, if you save all your all your chips before until gameweek 32 or at least excluding the trouble captain, which is less important this season, um, yeah, you can wait until gameweek 32 before deciding what you're going to do. No problem whatsoever, but always good to get some ideas. And here are some of mine. So, here is strategy number one. And uh yeah, please feel free to groan if you've heard of this strategy before because it is the template strategy. And this strategy involves making uh transfers with no regard to fixtures beyond Gameweek 31 in the short term. So, you're going to be making transfers ensuring you have 11 playingers for gameweek 31. Gameweek 31 is going to be a small blank gameweek. So, you shouldn't have too many issues here. just sell some Arsenal players, sell any Wolves players you have, and if if uh Man City and Crystal Palace end up blanking, which I think is 90% likely at this moment, then sell a couple of them guys as well, and you should be able to field 11 players for gameweek 31 with not much issue at all. Then what you're going to do is you're going to wild card in gameweek 32. So you don't really have to worry about anything beyond gameweek 32 because you you can wild card there. One small note, I mean, if you have a lot of team value invested in certain players, you may want to keep them and bench them in 31. But gameweek 32, uh, new me, new team, um, you're going to pick as many double gameweek 33 players as possible to maximize a gameweek 33 bench boost. Very nice. So, you're going to have a huge opportunity for bench boost. I think 33 could be nice for bench boost this season as well because there's a lot of cheap defenders who will get Defcon. You know, say you have a player, a defcon defender, a cheap defcon defender, whether that's an Anderson or a Richards or a Muki, I don't know, and they get, you know, two points for playing, two points for Defcon. And they do that twice. That's eight points right there per defender before they've even done anything. They've got no clean sheets, they got no bonus points, they got no attacking returns, and they've already got eight points, which is amazing. If you can do that for two defenders, 16 points. Get a goalkeeper who can score four points, then we're we're we're already up to 20 points. get a an extra attacker like you know a fifth midfielder or third forward on the bench as well. Maybe they only score two points and already we're a 22 point bench boost which in most seasons would be considered a successful bench boost. So you don't even need anything to happen as long as you can get plenty of double gameweek players which um with a wild card in 32 should be pretty easy to do. Um free hitting gameweek 34 to remove all of those blanking players. Um, if you still have your triple captain, use it on a future double gameweek if there is one. Gameweek 36 looks like the best candidate right now. That is not guaranteed. You may have to end up using the triple captain kind of uh reactionarily. Is that a word? Reactionarily, reactionally, I don't know. Um, because there may not be a double um later on in the season. And that's kind of why it is optional and why the triple captain is less important because yes, we're getting a big double game in 33 most likely, but actually outside of that, there's not too much going on in ways of doubles. So if you already use your your triple captain chip, it's not really going to affect your your chip strategy at all really. It's kind of unimportant. So uh yeah, weak weak season for triple captain, but um still um there is still plenty of other chips that you can get a lot of power from. So that is strategy number one. It's the template strategy. It's the strategy that a lot of people will be doing. Um, you'll probably, you may have seen other content creators or even myself talk about this strategy before. You may think it is boring. You may think it is uh uncreative. Fair enough. Uh, but if I'm totally honest with you guys, anyone who has spent any amount of time kind of looking at the fixtures and the doubles and what's likely to happen will kind of arrive at the conclusion that this is just super obvious as a strategy. It's just so obvious. It ticks every box. it kind of deals with every problem and it provides a solution for them. So this just seems like the best strategy based on current information and um yeah this is the one I strongly think I will be going for because it is just so obvious right now but there are some other options. So this is strategy number two and this is for those of you guys who have already used your wild card and you're not dead and buried yet guys don't you worry there's still plenty to be done. So, this strategy is going to involve prioritizing players who have a fixture in gameweek 31. That either means keeping or buying players who have a fixture in uh blank gameweek 31. Trying to get I think 10 players. 10 playingers for 31 would be fine. Obviously, 11 is preferable if you can get a full squad out. Um but you're also kind of wanting to keep an eye on players who also double in 33. So, if you can get players who have a fixture in 31, but also double in 33, then that would probably be a good thing. Of course, we don't know for sure who those uh teams are going to be, but we need to keep an eye on it. We need to keep an eye on what's most likely to happen as well. If you've already wild card, it's going to be really important to keep an eye on things and really keep your head in the game. St stay ahead of the game and eyes on the prize, eyes on the ball. There's a bunch of cliches for you. Um after that, you're going to use your bench boost in gameweek 33. um if you've if [clears throat] you've created a strong enough bench, which hopefully you'll be able to do. If not, you can use this chip kind of reactionarily later and I think maybe gameweek 35 looks like a potential candidate for a bench boost, not because of double gameweeks or anything like that, but because some of the cheaper players have uh fairly good fixtures in gameweek 35. Um so, you know, maybe so, you know, Burnley versus Leads for example, maybe there's some cheapies there you can get. We got Sunderland versus Wolves. if you got some cheapies there as well. So, yeah, just uh some kind of examples for you guys. Um they could potentially work there, but uh I think generally speaking, bench boost still going to be 33 even if you haven't got a wild card to set it up. Gameweek 34 is still going to be your free hit to remove all of your blanking players. And if you still have your triple captain, uh you can use it on a future double gamewick, if there is one, your game 36 again looks like the best candidate. And here is strategy number three. And this is the Uno reverse strategy. It's uh kind of like the first strategy but kind of a little bit backwards. But I'll kind of explain why and why that might work. Um so stick with me guys. This one could really emerge as a better strategy depending on which teams end up kind of going through to the FA Cup semi-finals and having those blanks and having those doubles. If it is a different subset of teams than is currently projected, then it may change things a little bit. But let's go through this. So the reverse strategy. So make transfers with no regard beyond gameweek 31 ensuring you have 11 playing players for blank gameweek 31. So same as the other strategies wild card in gameweek 32 but this time instead of picking players who double in 33 you're going to pick players who blank in 34. So ensuring that you have a playing 11 for gameweek 34 with little to no regard to who doubles in gameweek 33. Now, one possible advantage of doing this is that um one you can free hit in Gameweek 33 rather than the bench boost, which means you have the pick of the bunch. There is a world in which the best players for double gaming 33 that you think are going to be the best players in gamewick 32. By the time gam 33 comes around, maybe you've changed your mind. If you hit in 33, you've got one extra week of data to make your selections. Though, you do sacrifice the bench doublers, if that makes sense. Now the other advantage of doing it this way and free hitting in 33 is if gameweek 34 actually has some quite strong teams and quite strong players actually quite like to keep longterm. So for example let's say Arsenal end up you know getting booted out of the FA Cup in the quarterfinals and uh and so did Newcastle before the quarter in the quarterfinals maybe or before and suddenly Arsenal play in 34 and don't double in 33. But wait, you want to have Arsenal players in your team long term. So if you're wild carding Arsenal players in, you either have a situation where they're not doubling in 33 and you're bench boosting non-doublers or you don't include Arsenal players in your wild card team. So just so you can maximize your bench boost in 33, which wouldn't be ideal really. So you know, we can extend that to some other teams. I mean, Man City, I think it is highly unlikely that they will um not have a double in 33. So, Man City will probably be the players you want on your wild card. Um, you know, whether they free hit or not, I don't know, sorry, whether they double or not, but they will. Um, but seems like Manchester United and I think Manchester United not actually that likely to double in 33 and pretty likely to have a fixture in 34. If you want a lot of Manchester United uh players in your team long term, then you know maybe freehitting them out in 33 is a better idea than freehitting them in in gaming 34 and not having them as part of your long-term squad. Now, a lot of these kind of things are resolved by just saving loads of transfers. Um but you know there there there's just a world in which actually doing this kind of back to front a little bit could work. It does mean that your bench boost is going to be weaker, but actually in the scenario in which the a lot of the players who don't double are players you want longterm, actually this strategy is a lot better. Now, in this strategy, there is no natural place for the bench boost and indeed trouble captain chips, which is just going to probably default to 36 um if there's a double there. Um but bench boost again, you may be looking at gameweek 35 for a bench boost just because some of those cheaper players have some of the better fixtures there. So wild card and free hit would be sorted in this strategy. Bench boost and triple captain are very very difficult to place in this strategy to be to be honest and again you may have to kind of muddle through use them reactionarily and you know indeed if you've already used your bench boost in triple captain actually this maybe favors you using this strategy a little bit more as well. Um, if you've already used your bench boost, there is kind of less uh need, I guess, to to save, you know, to to leave gameweek 33 as an open gameweek. You can use a chip there. You can use your wild card there. You can use your free hit there. You can use uh your triple captain there as well if you've already used your bench boost in a previous gameweek. So, that could potentially work as well. Um, and kind of those are kind of I guess a few varieties of strategy 3, which is just a different it's just a reverse version of what we've seen already. So, those are the strategies I've come up with based on current information. I hope they were useful to you. I hope this video in general has been useful to you and uh yeah, um it's been fun to make and it's been some hard work to make. Um but I love learning about this stuff. I love understanding this stuff and uh I think it's really really useful as well and it's it's setting us a really nice platform really to kind of go into this next fixture period with some confidence when each game week passes and we have more narrowed down information. we kind of already know a little bit what to expect and uh we can prepare for various things which is great. Uh always helps to be prepared in the world of FPL. But that's going to be it from me today guys. If you did enjoy this one, drop a like, do subscribe. We'll be back for more videos throughout the w the week focusing more on transfers than chip strategy to be honest guys. And we did already upload buy, sell, keep avoid. You can check it out right there if you want to. Thanks so much for watching once again and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "Gameweek 27 is here and whilst gameweek 26 hasn't technically finished yet, we are already looking ahead at some transfers. So, in the calm before the storm, who should we be buying? Who should we be selling? Well, let's find out in this week's Why, Sell, Keep avoid. This video is split into two parts. The first of which we'll be looking at those players you may already have in your team and which ones you should keep and which ones you should sell. After that, we'll be looking at the players you don't have and which players you should buy and which you should avoid. Players will be tier listed with the best players at the top and the worst players at the bottom. Welcome to FPL mate. My name is Dan and welcome to the calm before the storm because in four gamew weeks time after the next four game weeks things are going to get a little bit crazy. We're going to have blanks, we're going to have doubles. will be talking about all of that in the video coming out probably on Tuesday because I am recording buy, sell, keep avoid a little bit earlier on Sunday because I do want to give myself a couple of days to work on a new chip strategy video which will be going over the latest double and blank gameweek, I guess, news, likeliness, all of that good stuff. So, today we're going to talk transfers, guys. And like I said, the next four game weeks are pretty straightforward. No doubles, no no blanks, everything looks great. So, let's start off with our forwards that we may already have in our team. And we're going to start off with the likes of Thiago, who I think if you have him in your team still, and I know he has blanked for a few game weeks, I would 100% be keeping him in my team. I mean, look at this run, guys. All green fixtures, all beautiful fixtures coming up. Um, we like the look of this a lot. Brighton, Burnley, Bournemouth, and Wolves in the next four. I think there's lots of points to be had. And certainly Thiago actually has been underperforming his data for once, which is crazy. 17 shots, 16 in the box, and six big chances in the past uh six game weeks. Of course, he is the main man penalty taker extraordinaire, and I'm sure there'll be a few more penalties with Dango back in the team, winning those penalties for him as he was doing kind of before he went off to AFCON. So, I really like the look of Thiago, and I think he's even worth talking about when we come to the buy section. Ekit, another player I would be looking to keep here. And I I know everyone is kind of going crazy over Joel Pedro right now, but did you know Ekik actually has better underlying data than Joel Pedro? And we'll come to that a little bit later when we talk about the Chelsea striker. But Ekk, the numbers here are really strong. Like similar to Thiago, 18 shots, 14 in the box, eight big chances with 2.78 xG. If you've been watching Ecato over the last couple of Premier League games, you will be surprised to see that he hasn't come away with more because he had has had some huge chances. He just needs to start finishing them off. Thankfully, Liverpool do have some good fixtures now. The fixtures are improving from here on, particularly from gameweek 28 onwards. They look really, really nice all the way up until gameweek 32 where you may be thinking about wild carding around about that kind of time. Ollie Watkins, another player I would maybe be looking to keep. his um his data has dropped a little bit. He is it is getting a little bit weaker and obviously there has been a couple of weaker performances. That said, I think from an attacker's perspective, the next three fixtures are quite nice. Uh leads, Wolves, and Chelsea at home. Chelsea concede a whole bunch of chances and I think Watkins still seems to be nailed on for minutes. I think there is definitely potential here, but this is a keep that doesn't come without some risks. So, one bit of news coming out of the gameweek 26 games was Harland substituted at Halime with a knee issue. Didn't play in the FA Cup game this weekend either, which means there is maybe some doubt around his availability for Newcastle. We do need to keep an eye on this. The issue is seemingly not too serious. So, I think he will be back very soon. And I do think, you know, he is going to be a player you would like to have from gameweek 28 onwards if he is going to be available because I think the fixtures are very good there for Man City. There's always going to be question marks around Harland's value for money, particularly when he's not in the best of form. Uh that said, uh what else are you going to spend the money on right now? There seems to be uh not too many options when it comes to expensive players. Maybe we'll have a look at a few of them though later on in the video. Um Harland however I think is most likely going to be a keep and the only kind of exception to that is if he is going to be out for a little bit longer because remember guys Man City are like 95% likely and we'll talk about this more in tomorrow uh well tomorrow the next day's video whenever it comes out our our strategy video um we're going to see Harle 95% chance of blanking in gameweek 31. No fixt during gameweek 31. If he is out actually for a couple of game weeks, then suddenly, you know, maybe he's only back for 29 and 30 or something like that and suddenly he's blanking again in 31, is there any point in keeping him at that point? Particularly if you're wild carding in 32 and maybe planning to bring him back in at that point anyway. So, if there is an injury, then I think Harland is going to be a cell if he's going to be out for a couple of game weeks. But, I think in all likeliness, he's probably going to be back. So, let's keep an eye on that one. Let's monitor it. Evan Nilson is going to be in here as well as a monitor. A slight dip in form recently, but I think the numbers are still reasonably good. They're not quite Thiago and Echitique levels, but they're okay. He is 7 million, which is not super cheap, but it's cheap enough where I think you can get away with keeping him if you want to. And the fixtures are certainly good enough to keep him as well. So, there are still are some things to like about Evan Nilson if you're happy to continue to take the risk on what is a fairly lowowned FPL asset. Calbert Lewin wants to monitor. The good fixtures are coming again reasonably soon. Of course, he missed out in gameweek 26 due to illness, but he is going to be available again for gameweek 27. No problem whatsoever there. Jared Bowen is kind of edging towards the cell category as well. But I think the Bulma at home fixture, he's going to be fine to keep for that one. And maybe after that, you could think about selling him if you do indeed still have him in your squad. Remember, he is a penalty taker like Cal Lewen, like probably Evan Nilson, too. So there is definitely some advantages to a lot of these guys on this list. You know if they get a penalty even if they haven't been performing recently suddenly things look very very different indeed. But Joarez is a player whose penalty status may be under scrutiny because Bukayo Saka is now fit back and available a little bit sooner than expected. So Yarez being a little bit of a rotation risk there. Another disappointing performance in gameweek 26 so far. Maybe he turns it around against Wolves. But yes, certainly he was a player who there were certain advantages to buying him ahead of a double gameweek. But given that the next two fixtures, Spurs, Chelsea, are pretty average fixtures. I don't think they're amazing fixtures or anything like that. And then in gameweek 31, we are going to have a blank gameweek for Arsenal, I think the appeal of Jockarez is largely disappearing. So definitely a player I would be more willing to sell. Walter still rotation risk player with pretty poor fixtures. So we'll be looking to sell him. Mateta as well with his long-term injury is going to be a fairly obvious sell. Crystal Palace, by the way, with another team with 95% blank likeliness in Gameweek 31. Into midfield. And yes, guys, indeed, some people are selling Bruno Fernandez. I believe he is the ninth most sold midfielder at time of recording ahead of Gameweek 27. And yeah, it's just it's it's not the one. He's just the guy right now. Um, he really is in terms of those midfielder picks. So, no way I'd be selling him. I think there are some pretty average fixtures in this run to be fair, but I think, you know, Man United have generally been in some good form. Maybe the West Ham game wasn't great in 26, but uh certainly with all of the set pieces, penalties, and everything that he's providing, I mean, 27 key passes, guys, in six game weeks. That is absolutely crazy stuff. So, no doubt about it. Bruno Fernandez is a player you're going to want to have in and around your FPL team. Morgan Rogers, another player I would definitely be looking to keep ahead of this run. Like I say, I do like the I like the look of this run of fixtures for Aston Villa more for an attacker than a defender. I think there's definitely some games where Rogers can uh really really perform. And in gameweek 31 where we are going to be struggling for players a little bit uh because of all of the blankers. Um Rogers plays West Ham which is a pretty good fixture there. Enzo another player to keep. I know he has been points dodging like crazy recently so it would seem. Um, Burnley at home up next. It's just not a game you would typically look to sell uh your players when they're about to play Burnley at home if you're at least happy about their minutes and at least they're, you know, providing something in ways of, you know, creating, taking shots, that kind of stuff, which Enzo certainly is. So, um, in my mind, he is probably going to be a keep for this week. And I think when we go into gameweek 28 where the fixtures do look a little bit more troubling for Chelsea, he is a player we would perhaps look at maybe removing after this game week. So got to give him this week in my opinion. Wilson a player I would be quite keen to continue on with. Plenty of shots he's still taking, set pieces and the like. Um underperforming creatively, so hopefully he can pick up a few more assists. The Sunderland away game is not perfect necessarily, but I think he is playable in that gameweek and certainly 28-29 against Spurs and West Ham at home. You would be looking to start Wilson in those games. And of course, gameweek 31 where again we are going to be lacking a decent chunk of FPL options. I guess Wilson is going to be facing Burnley in gameweek 31. So, not quite on the screen, guys, but he is going to be one of those uh real useful players to have when the chaos of the season truly begins. So, uh, Wilson must stay. Uh, well, at least he must be considered to stay because I don't think it's an absolute must keep because the fixtures upcoming are not perfect, but certainly strong arguments to keep him, particularly if you can bench him. If you can't really bench him ever, maybe there are some better options, but still Garner. Um, another player who you could maybe sell if you really wanted to. The fixes aren't amazing for Everton, but a player like Garner who is kind of a bit of a defcon beast. maybe not the same as a defcon beast as Anderson. Um, you know, he his fixture it doesn't really matter. He's always going to pick up those Defcon uh well opportunities at least because he's kind of tracking what like four Defcon points hits in the last six gameweeks. I know 93 defcons in six game weeks looks crazy high, but he got like 28 29 in one game, which has really inflated those numbers. So, I think he's fine to stick around, but if you, you know, have an idea of a new midfielder you want to buy and there aren't really any other options on on who to sell, then I think Garner could be sacrificed, particularly as he has lost some set pieces since Juicebury Hall has returned. Declin Rice, I I still think is an okay option. I think really because we have some average fixtures in the next two and we have that guaranteed gameweek 31 blank. I think those are really some strong reasons to maybe think about selling Rice only if you have another midfielder who you really want to bring into your team. I think Rice is absolutely fine to keep. He is, you know, perfectly good to keep but he is sacrificable and I think that is the key point here. Kuna another player who I think is sacrificeable and I think the reason for that is because of some concerns around his minutes. Now, obviously, he has been returning here and there over the last six game weeks, which has been pretty nice for owners, but we're seeing a lot of early substitutes. And with Shesho scoring in gameweek 26, kind of against West Ham, the hero of that game really to recover the unbeaten record under Carrick. I think as such, there is maybe a world in which Kuna is benched for the next game and Shesco plays up front. Now, I can't say that, you know, for a guarantee either way. And even if it doesn't happen in gameweek 27, we're then looking at gameweek 28. will it happen then instead? So I think Kuna is definitely a benching waiting to happen and whether you care about that or you know are worried about that is maybe a personal decision but for me he is another one of those players who falls into the sacrificeable kind of category when we're looking at straight up cells Turkey Foden these guys are just definite cells I mean come on I mean who still has these guys at this point hopefully you don't but if you do um there's so many great midfield options that we're going to talk about today that you can replace these guys with things can get better. But really, the rotation risk combined with the real real lack of performances, you know, one goal and one assist for Churkey and Foden combined over the past six game weeks, it's just not good enough. And Bruno G. Yeah, disappointing news for Bruno G as he has picked up a hamstring injury and he is going to be out for a significant period of time. We're talking like two months that this guy is going to be out for. If you are a Bruno G owner, he is a 100% definite bonafidey cell. In terms of defenders, Chaliba is going to be a keep for this Burnley at home game. He has actually been one of the Defcon masters recently, but maybe that's more to do with Chelsea's poor defensive performances and he's just having to do so much defending perhaps. Um, and you know, maybe some of the ways in which he gets Defcon Gons is kind of interesting. Let's just put it that way. But he's doing him and that gets you FPL points. Now, I think after this game week, the four-pointers that he seems to be picking up maybe could turn into some three-pointers if Chelsea conceded a few more goals against some more difficult oppositions. But in 27 against Burnley, you may be looking at a four-point minimum, assuming he gets his defensive contribution points. Maybe not, maybe not guaranteed. And you know, Burnley do have a annoying knack of getting the odd goal here and there, but I I just can't see a world in which you would sell a nailedon player playing against Burnley at home. So, Chalaba's got to be a keep this week and then next week definitely a player to reassess. Timber, I don't think has to go this week necessarily. Spurs in a transitional period with some with a new management, but I don't think they're suddenly going to find their score their shooting boots. So, Timber I think is going to be fine to keep for 27 and we can maybe start to reassess that one as we get to Chelsea, Brighton and indeed the blank in 31. Mark Gay, another player I wouldn't really be looking to sell this week. I think the next two fixtures are pretty average against Newcastle and Leads, but there are still some good clean sheet opportunities before he is blank in gameweek 31. Um, I can't really see myself selling him to be honest because I think Man City and Gayhei has just been fairly reliable recently and of course he did indeed score as well in the FA Cup. Maybe we could see him get back to his Crystal Palace scoring ways this time in a Man City shirt. Sessi want to monitor. Now the fixtures are great and on paper a Bournemouth defender right now who's you know typically a defcon guy looks great but unfortunately there has been a certain other uh defender who has been eating up all of the defcon at Bournemouth who of course we will be talking about again this week but Sessi he has been falling a little short on defcon over the last two game weeks. I don't think that is necessarily going to continue to happen every single gameweek. I think defcon will be back on the cards for him. He has been a reliable Defcon guy throughout the season and the fixtures are good. So I think things could potentially turn around for him um in the coming game weeks in in kind of a contrast to the last couple of weeks. But um yeah, I guess we do have to monitor him a little bit because if he continues to really really just be mogged by Hill in terms of Defcon, then you know, it's become becomes a little bit more difficult to justify Sessi. I I think the defense is not maybe not as bad as some people make it out to be at Bournemouth right now. And I think in these fixtures there will be a couple of clean sheet opportunities for him and for Bournemouth. It's just about that defcon really. Rehys James is of course always going to be a rotation risk player. But ahead of this Burnley game now we know he's fit and available. I wonder if it is a risk worth taking. I guess that's down to your risk appetite. But Rais James at home against Burnley if he does start in that game and you know not only does he have some some clean sheet potential but also you know being that set piece man set piece taker you're always going to have those additional chances of you know spiking a goal spiking an assist and maybe even getting into bonus if the clean sheets's there as well. I think James is such a high-risisk high reward player but if you still have him in your team and you're happy to continue on with that high-risisk high reward then why not? Collins this is a really interesting one. Now, I asked some Brenford fans uh recently, why isn't Collins playing at the moment? Why hasn't he not started the last three games? And the short answer really is that despite all of his FPL points, he hasn't actually been playing that well. Um certainly in the few games before he was dropped, he wasn't playing that well. And Andrews at Brenford is just a manager who is happy to rotate his defenders based on form. Now, there's every chance Collins comes back into the starting lineup for Brenford, but it's probably going to require one of the other defenders, so Aya or Vandenberg to drop an absolute stinker in a Brenford chair. And if that happens, then maybe Collins comes back in and reclaims his place. We don't know if that's going to happen. We don't know when's that going to happen. It's really difficult to say. So, is he a keep? Is he a cell? I don't know. The good thing is certainly over the last two game weeks is that he whilst he has been benched he hasn't been auto subed on because he hasn't had any minutes played and in that sense maybe there is some argument to say you know start him try him out if he doesn't play then hopefully you've got a backup on the bench but he is definitely a player we do need to keep an eye on if you are a Collins owner hopefully things can turn around hopefully you can get back into the starting 11 and become a really useful asset again because we know he's good for attacking contributions and indeed defcon on. Um, so I would like him to be in the lineup again, but we don't know right now. And, you know, we got to keep an eye on those other Brenford guys and the other Brenford performances. If Brighton, you know, absolutely dominate Brenford, score a couple of goals, the the current center backs drop stinkers. Collins is back in play. So, maybe you can bench Collins this week. Wait and see for next week. Um, yeah. So, that's basically the rundown on Collins. Difficult really to place him because we don't know what's going to happen next. um he could go in either direction in terms of keep or sell um in the next week. So, we'll keep an eye on him. Definitely a monitor. And Kuka um an injury that is likely to see him out for game week 27, but we don't know for 100% sure. It is a hamstring injury, which is usually bad news for a player. Of course, he picked up picked that up uh injury up the other game. If he's back for Burnley or if it looks likely he could be back for Burnley, maybe he's worth keeping. But uh if he is going to be out then yeah just an obvious cell because after that the fixtures are pretty stinky for Chelsea. Cash is going to go in the cell category. Minor injury not sure if he's going to be back for game 27 but just in general with Aston Villa I'm not massively keen on their defenders because they don't get defensive contributions. Cash I think is kind of overrated when it comes to attacking potential. He doesn't really have that much. and clean sheets. Well, yeah, Aston Villa keep a clean sheet maybe one every three games, but over this run of fixtures outside of Wolves, I don't think there's an obvious clean sheet fixture here. I think Leads have a very good chance of scoring and in 29 and 30, Chelsea, Man United away from home. Yeah, surely surely there is going to be better picks to come in uh to have in the coming gameweek. So, I think I would maybe use this opportunity to just sell cash to be totally honest. just not really my kind of pick. But maybe that is some personal bias um when placing him in the cell category. Vanderven um yeah poor fixtures. We don't really know what's going on with the managers. Defcon is not super common and just Spurs have been so bad defensively. I don't think any new manager can suddenly magically resolve that one. And Tarovski, the fixtures are poor, the price is very high, and the defcon has begun to dry up as well. really with with uh Everton defenders. It's only game week 29 where these Everton defenders look even playable. They've got Man United, Newcastle and Arsenal in the next four and they've got some difficult fixtures kind of in game 31, 32. Um really the next seven game weeks are really really rough for them outside of that Burnley game. So yeah, Tarovski at that price, yeah, it's got to be a sell. And guys, we are of course back after a little break from the FA Cup. So, if you wouldn't mind leaving a little like on the video to welcome me back to YouTube after what is it 4 days off, 5 days off, um I would be massively appreciated to help me get back in the algorithm. Do feel free to subscribe as well if you're new. Right, let's check out some players to buy. We spoke about Thiago and Echk already, but you know, I really would be strongly looking at these players as potential buys. Certainly Thiago because the fixtures really are so nice all the way up until a gameweek 32 wild card, but also beyond um as well. So if you're not planning on wild carding in game 32, Thiago serves you really really well um really for the next 67 game week. So um I did the 67 thing again that was accidental but guys Thiago looks really good right now. Days are good on penalties fixtures good everything is pointing in the right direction when we're looking for those FPL picks. a strong consideration to buy um you know if you've got a third forward as well right now who uh is kind of you know like a 4.5 million forward who you know is not going to play uh in gameweek 31 and you just need to have uh in gameweek 31 an additional player in your squad so you can field a full 11 in the blank gameweek. I think upgrading one of your one of your cheap forwards, I guess, to someone like Thiago, it could be really nice. Or if you got a Maray, an Obi, a Mane, even up to someone like Thiago, if that's possible, if you can free up just, you know, a couple of million to make that upgrade, I think it may be well worth doing in preparation for game 31. I think that's the way I'm looking at doing it. But anyway, um, Ekit also still looks really good with really good underlying data, and I think the fixtures are certainly good enough for him as well to go forward and succeed. So, uh, let's see what happens there. Joel Pedro is a really interesting one and finding him really difficult to place right now because on on the one hand, Burnley at home is a fantastic fixture for him. You know, it's the best fixture for him as long as he's starting in that game and there's no guarantee of that happening. I think it's fairly likely though. Um, he is potentially even captain material in gameweek 27. You you have to put him in that category. But after that when the fixtures look rougher, the rotation maybe becomes a little bit more of an issue um suddenly Joel Pedro becomes a problem player. So if you are happy to go for a a shortterm punt with you know maybe you know being aware that you'll live have to sell him or maybe bench him in some of these game you know Arsenal away probably going to bench him maybe you can start him in in 2930 potentially you know if you're comfortable with that then um yeah absolutely go for him. I mean certainly there's not that many options in the forward position right now. So whilst Joel Pedro comes with significant risks you know the alternative is to not just get no points in gameweek 27 but get no points in gameweek 28 29 30 anyway. So uh yeah I think Joel Pedro is is you know one of the better of a bad bunch amazing for 27 but even from 28 onwards is he really that much worse than a lot of the other options even in these really difficult fixtures? Probably not. So yeah, could be considered as a buy after that. It's pretty rough out there. I mean, I've got Strand Lawson in here. Very likely 95% chance of a blank in gameweek 31. So that's not looking good. Um but he looked good first game in a Crystal Palace shirt. Uh well actually second technically. Um yeah, looked reasonably impressive I I think. So, uh, Wolves at home is a good fixture as we well know. If he is, you know, starting in that game again, which we we see no reason why he wouldn't be and he can continue his performance and really get his confidence back, we know he's a good player. So, you know, maybe this could be pretty good. I think Man United away is not an ideal fixture, but I think he's perfectly playable in that game week and 2930, I think these are definitely weeks in which you would look to start him as well. So yeah, he does blank in 31 most likely, but I think you can get some use out of him between now and then, particularly at 6.1 million. So if you've got a few free transfers, you know, in the bank, you're happy to take short-term punts. Players like Joel Pedro, players like Strand Lson, I think could be reasonably useful for you, but they're not going to be for everyone. If you're kind of lacking transfers and already foreseeing some problems in 31, maybe you're less likely to go for some of these guys. So yeah, horses for courses and all of that. Watkins also in here. one to monitor. We need to see his performances improve, but there are some okay fixtures in here for him. Um, particularly 27, 28, and 31. Creeper Jr., you could potentially look at him. We know Bournemouth have some nice fixtures coming up. He was rested in gameweek 26, but I think he should come back into the starting 11 in gameweek 27 where there should be more opportunities. He's one of those players who just, you know, scores one goal every four or five gameweeks and blanks the rest of the time. If that's your kind of player, then why not? Bowen, not really sure I'd be looking at him as much to be honest. Bournemouth at home, not such a bad fixture, but the next three not so keen on for West Ham. Actually, the next four I'm not so keen on as well because we do have Aston Villa in game 31 for West Ham. And avoid Calbert Lewin. Pretty weird time to buy him away against Villa at home against Man City. Probably can wait a couple more weeks before going in on the lead striker. Shesho. I think there's just too much rotation risk there to go for him. I mean, he just simply has not been starting for Manchester United, and I don't think it's worth taking a risk that he will suddenly start. I mean, it's definitely possible, but you know, like we kind of mentioned with Kuna earlier in the video, Shesho starts in game at 27. Fine. There's no guarantee he then starts in game at 28, 29, or indeed 30. So, you're playing with fire every week, and not really my favorite thing to play with fire. Uh, prefer to play with ice, uh, snowmen and all that. Much more fun. Yarez, uh, we've got him next. Yeah, his usefulness as a double gameweek punt is kind of expended now. Blanking in gameweek 31. The next few fixtures are not particularly amazing necessarily. So, uh yeah, he is definitely not going to be a player I would recommend buying right now. In midfield, there's loads of options. Bruno continues to be a really really solid buy, but I imagine most of you guys have him already in your team. Florian verts if not is probably going to be the next option kind of alongside who isn't in this video but um yeah I kind of put in the sim similar category to Vertz as in kind of a mid8 million kind of price tag who is reasonably reliable good data the kind of player we like the look of so yeah Vert if you can't go for Ecat or you don't have ETK and you want some Liverpool attack coverage I certainly do like the look of Vertz maybe gameweek 27 is a little early but certainly from gameweek 28 I think he is right back in contention is going to be a really nice pick. the form has just been so much better from him and I think um I think he can really get some of those you you know you know those really big scores you know those halls those monster scores and he's got a couple of them in his locker in the upcoming game but if you do want to go a bit cheaper with your picks Dango is back man like the fixtures look really good for him the performances has been good he looks like he's in good form right now he is a differential not too many people have him in their team and I just think this could be the punt to go for right now if you were looking to go cheap um He runs you all the way until like gameweek 3233 in terms of good fixtures that just keep coming and coming and coming. Um, have I sold him to you yet? Maybe. Uh, yeah, he looks like the pick if you're going a little bit cheaper. Although, I'm not sure I would double up on Thiago. Maybe for those of you guys who aren't going for Thiago or who don't have Thiago and want to find a midfield route into the Brenford attack, Dango would be the guy to go for. Not to say a double up is necessarily bad, but uh yeah, certainly I'd be more likely to go for Dango if I wasn't going for Thiago. Rogers wants a monitor. Certainly a player to consider buying for this game week with the good fixtures in the the next two and the good fixture in 31. Um taking plenty of shots as we know and creating a little bit as well. But as always, Roger's underlying numbers, they're not particularly uh amazing. Palmer's going to be a really interesting one because he is to me the best captain for Game 27. Um, let's be totally real. Um, players like Jo Pedro, players like Palmer, they have been they have been pretty lucky. Let's put it that way in the last two game weeks. I mean, three penalties all won by Joel Pedro. Two of them because the opposing player just randomly decided to shove Joel Pedro over in the box. I mean, it's not going to happen every single game week, right? We think, but you know, recent trends suggest that Chelsea are picking up a lot of penalties. But I think we have to be, you know, admit that some have been more fortunate than others. Um, Palmer of course with all of those penalty goals, that's been great. 5.1 xG looks amazing, but when you factor in those penalties and the fact that he missed a very much an open goal in gameweek 26, you kind of understand why these numbers are so high. Um, so, you know, take them with context a little bit, but for gameweek 27 in isolation, he looks like the best captain to me. And I think that's pretty straightforward. And I think most people will probably agree with that one as well. But beyond that, he is a very expensive asset to have uh a really difficult run of fixtures because really from gameweek 28, Chelsea have the worst fixtures in the Premier League. No team has fixtures that are worse. So if you have a few transfers spare, you're happy to do the inout hoke koke with Cole Palmer, then yeah, fine. For the sake of getting captaincy, do it. But he comes with, you know, uh he basically costs two transfers is is what I'm saying. probably going to cost you two transfers because I don't imagine you would be as keen on owning him in some of the more difficult fixtures. So is a similar situation where if you have a lot of free transfers, he is a player you could potentially go for because of that blank in gameweek 31. So if you're happy to pick up another blanking player with the uh with the knowledge that you'll have to use another transfer to remove him in gameweek 31. And I know some people will say, \"Well, Dan, I'm just going to free hit in game 31.\" I don't have to worry about that. Wait until the next video. Make sure you subscribed, guys. Make sure you got notifications on because when you watch the next video, I'm pretty convinced you guys are going to be totally against free hitting in gameweek 31. But you'll have to wait for that video to find out why that is in uh more detail. But let's just put it this way. If you think you you're going to have a few players blanking in gameweek 31, yeah, wait until you hear about gameweek 34. Anyway, guys, we have got uh Semeno here as a potential buy only if you have loads of spare transfers to do a hokeie koke. We got a risky player here, Ryan. Um, not really enough data, certainly not enough long-term data in the Premier League to really get an idea on how good he's going to be, but he looks very good so far. I've watched a lot of Bournemouth recently and Ryan looks fabulous and the fixtures are good. He's just 5.5 million. Could be a risk worth taking. He could be a Semeno regen in this Bournemouth size. A really interesting pick, but he is seriously risky because he is so new to the league. Avoid Somerville. The former has been good but the fixtures beyond well even game meet 27 I don't think is a the perfect fixture against Bournemouth um yeah the fixtures the fixtures are just not there the over performance has been um significant but the form has been there so um I just can't really see myself going for someone like over Ryan and Dango who have also been in good form but have significantly better fixtures and play for significantly better teams as well you would probably say Enzo is not like Joel Pedro is not like Palmer because Enzo I don't think is as captainable in in gameweek 27. So the upside isn't really there um in gameweek 27 in isolation and really gameweek 28 29 30 31 32 um rubbish for Chelsea. Really really rubbish. So uh why pick up an extra Chelsea player with such terrible fixtures if you're not even going to captain him in game 27 because really if you're buying Chelsea players I would want them to be captain material at the very least and I'm not sure Enzo is that guy. So line not really a player I'd be looking to pick up uh either. H surely the the uh free kick and corner goals and assists aren't going to necessarily continue. I just think there are just better options at 6.7 million in the game of FPL right now. As for your defenders, Gabrielle is going to continue to be the most essential defender in in the whole game, right? Uh Hill continues to perform. I mean we speak about him pretty frequently over the last few few game weeks. We're kind of early adopters on Hill on the FPL Mate YouTube channel, but uh yeah, certainly he's looking good. I think maybe a little fortunate with the quantity of assists that he's had recently, but in terms of defensive contributions right now, no defender is doing better than him in the entire league. So, um he is top with with that in mind. The fixtures are good and there will be some clean sheets in here. Don't know how many, but there will be some. Um, but when you're getting Defcon every week, you have some kind of uh assist potential, whether that's from set pieces or, you know, throwins. He's like the main throwin taker or he'll or just passing a sideways pass to Ryan who's going to run up the whole pitch. Then, you know, we take it all. And for 4 million, so cheap. So, so cheap. Uh, there is no little really to talk about Hill against him other than maybe West Ham away is not the best fixture in the world at the moment where with West Ham kind of looking okay at the moment. Um, but certainly beyond that, Hill is is, you know, he's playable in every single game because of the Defcon. Virgil also a player to buy if you want to go a little bit more expensive. I think from a defensive perspective, this run of fixtures for Liverpool is really nice actually. Forest great fixture for a defender. Spurs, great fixture for a defender in West Ham. The Wolves are pretty good fixtures generally speaking. So, um, as such, Virgil I would be more than happy to pick up right now if I didn't have him already. And that is not me overreacting to the goal he scored last game week. Um, it's going to happen sometimes. I try not to judge players based on goals randomly scored. Um, but you know, it's so he's so much more than that right now. Uh, he's getting Defcon as well finally as well, which is good. So, lots to like lots to like about Virgil Mukle. Uh, the fixtures are back for Sunderland. So, you can definitely go in on him if you don't have him in your squad right now. Munoz high upside but does have that blank in gameweek 31. There is some potential there. Now, obviously, we spoke about Brenford and the rotation risk of pretty much all of their center backs right now. So, if you're unwilling to go for a Brenford center back, maybe you could go for Coyote. Doesn't really offer much in defensive contributions. Have a has a little bit of attacking threat, but nothing special. But the fixtures are good. The fixtures are good. And he will he'll get Defcon occasionally. He'll get an attacking return occasionally. And he's 4.5 million. So, maybe that's the route. Or maybe you could take a risk on someone like Aya at center back who I believe is 4.4 4 million. Mark Ghee, not sure I would necessarily buy him right now just because of that game 31 blank, but maybe a player to consider to consider to consider and Sessi is going to be an avoid. I mean, if you're going for one of him and Hill, Hill is the guy, right? And and until we see what's going on with Sessi's defcons in the long term, it's difficult to suggest buying him. Of course, you may keep him if you already have him, but if you're going for a Bournemouth defender right now, Hill is your guy. Hill is your guy. and I will die on that hill. Chalaba is in here as an avoid as well for a four-pointer against Burnley, which is probably what's going to happen. Um, is it worth the transfer considering the rubbish fixtures after that? And Malik Chow, goalcoring game at 26 after I sold him. I'm sure a few of you guys feel that pain, but the fixtures are just really bad for Newcastle as well. In terms of goalkeepers, keep Rya, keep Sanchez if you already have these guys. They got a good fixture in game 27 each. Um, I would definitely sell cells. Uh, but Pigford is maybe a sell as well because of the difficult runner fixtures and indeed the high price tag. So, might be worth selling if you want to if you've got no other priorities in your squad. If you're looking for a new goalkeeper, Keller would be the player I would buy for sure. Good fixtures for Brenford coming up. An easy and safe way into that Brenford defense with some save potential there as well. Particularly uh penalty saves could be uh a thing that Keller maybe specializes in. could get you some points that way. Martinez um probably one of the better ways into the Aston Villa defense in my opinion because you don't have to rely on defcon and he does get saves. And in terms of avoiding players, just those players who blank in gaming 31, Rya, Donaruma, these players are going to cause you problems in gameweek 31. So to buy them, I think would be a bad idea, particularly considering those who already own these players will maybe be looking to sell them in the near future. Although to be honest, if you've got Dravka as a backup, he's probably going to do the job in gameweek 31. But uh why put yourself in that position if you don't have to if you don't already have these players in your squad. But that's all of the players I'm going to talk about today. If there's anyone I missed out, let me know in the comments section and I will give them a rating by sell or avoid. Keep the discussion going, guys. Uh we love to talk about FBL here. I missed it a little bit, but we are now back for the new game week. Thank you for watching. Do leave a like. Do subscribe if you haven't done already. and I will see you on the next video, which is going to be a mega one. It's going to be all about double and blank gameweeks and the new information we have on those. Stay tuned and I'll see you later, mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "in the air. Yeah. Thank you. Woo! Heat. Heat. Well, well, well. Hello. Hello. One and all. It's It's almost time, guys. I've put the Arsenal shirt on because it's like an Arsenal kind of day. Well, Arsenal Arsenal kind of day. We've got to wait until Thursday. That's the one annoying thing about the uh double game week, isn't it? that it doesn't really begin until all the way on Thursday and then we got to wait again until uh Tuesday. Um but anyway guys, hello. Welcome to FPL mate. My name is Dan. It is double game week time. It's double game week time. I'm just putting out a tweet about the fact that we're streaming so just bear with me. Um someone says, \"Is the FPL site down?\" Not that I'm aware of. Um not that I'm aware of. I mean, I'm I'm logged onto it right now, so I think it's fine. Uh, the graphic is wrong. Arsenal can't play on the same day. What do you mean my graphic's wrong? I messed up. Oh, that should say, sorry, that should say Tuesday the I don't even know what day. Uh, Tuesday the 18th. Okay, hold on. Let me just update that real quick. Well spotted. Well spotted. Tuesday the 18th. You know, I thought I'd start streaming a little bit earlier today, but actually maybe I just should have spent an extra 15 minutes just ensuring all of the uh graphics are correct. Maybe that would have been a good idea. Anyway, guys, just fixing that now and it should be updated momentarily. But how is everyone doing regardless? Um members, let me know if you're here. Um, and I will say hello to all of you. Um, let's just put this tweet out. And then and then here we go. Right. Oh, we got a super chat already. Right. Okay. Which members have we got here? Carl is here. Uh Trash Pan is here. Max is here. Mark is here. Welcome guys. Welcome guys. And we got a super chat already uh from uh Yugen Raj who says, \"I can't afford Rice nor Timber for my third slot. Should I go Zuba Mendy? I need to replace Wilson.\" I think first of all, I don't think you do need to replace Wilson. Um Wilson's actually a player I'm looking at potentially buying. He has a game against Burnley in gameweek 31. um which is he's he's probably one of the best picks for blank gameweek 31. So I actually quite like Wilson. Would not be looking to um to kind of remove him to be honest. Um if you can't afford Rice or Timber, I think Celiba or you know if you got Rya already, I'm not sure. Um I'd maybe look to go there or I don't know man. I just think Zuba Mendy it doesn't fill me with inspiration. Um, I appreciate he has scored a fair amount of FPL points this season, but I think that's because availability has been his best ability this season more than anything. And he scored a couple of banger goals. I just, particularly as an Arsenal fan, I just don't know. It's the 17th. What's the Wednesday the 18th is when that uh Why are people saying 17th? Maybe it's a time zone thing. Um, so yeah. Um, I just I'm not I'm not at all inspired by the the Zub Mendy pick and I know so many people are so keen on um on him. Sorry, it's Wednesday the 18th. That's why that's why I'm getting wrong. It's Wednesday the 18th, not Tuesday. We will get this right eventually. The Wolves Arsenal game. So, it's definitely the 18th. We just got the day of the week wrong. Well, we're getting there eventually. We're getting there eventually. Right, there we go. Um, right, we've got uh we've got stuff to talk about today outside of Super Mendy because I just I don't know. I just cannot cannot get my head around the selling Zub Mendy. I sorry, buying Zub Mendy or selling Wilson really. Um, so I don't really know how to answer that without seeing a full team. It's difficult to say what your kind of other options are, but I would I would say that Zuba Mendy is like kind of very low priority. I mean that I if I was to rank Arsenal picks right now, I guess I would say number one Gabrielle, number two probably Rice, then Timber, then Rya, then Celiba, then Yarez. So at best, Zuma Mendi is the seventh best Arsenal pick in my opinion of course and you know on a double game week for a good team like Arsenal, do we really want the seventh best Arsenal pick? Few few questions around Califuri as well. Um I wasn't totally convinced by him uh in gameweek 25. Um, and also he's just come back from injury. So given that it's a kind of a Thursday game this week, I wonder if he could be rotation risk. I just I don't think I'd be willing to take the risk there. I don't think the upside is high enough there to um to really be worth going for. So yeah, not super keen on on the Califury pick either. So there are a lot of rogue picks and obviously look if you feel strongly about certain players then you should absolutely go for them but all I can really do here is uh kind of give my opinion. Uh got a super chat here from collage fen says one free transfer O'Reilly to uh will be able to manage gamew. Yeah, you definitely could do. But to be honest, if you if you have a feeling that O'Reilly will play against Fulham at home this week, I don't think it's such a bad fixture to have him. I don't think he's so bad. So, I think, you know, it's it's an improvement on the team, but um I don't think it's an essential move necessarily. I think it's an essential move. Um I still need to um make my transfers, by the way. Uh any team conference, press conference news? Um, yeah, not really too much interesting stuff. And I thought because we're streaming a little early today, we could just go through it together. Um, if you want and we'll kind of answer some questions, genu general FBL questions whilst we kind of do this on the side. Um, so uh yeah, we'll go through some of the press conference news um as well. And uh what we'll do is uh yeah, I there just wasn't too much interesting stuff. I'll put it that way. There was some press conferences yesterday. Uh there's some more today. I don't think we're getting an Arsenal press conference, unfortunately. So, I know a few of you guys may be wondering about like is Saka going to be back? Is he going to damage the, you know, like um like Maw's minutes? What's the Trosard situation? Yeah, unfortunately, uh it is just going to be a case of hoping for the best and picking safely. picking safely, picking sensibly, um I think is probably the wise move as well. Um but in terms of team news, the uh the biggest headline I guess some people I know are looking at Strand Lson. Um Mateta isn't going to need surgery, but Mateta is going to be out for it looks like weeks. So we can certainly consider that team news, I suppose. Uh, in fact, I'm going to just go ahead and start writing some notes here. So, Mateta will not have surgery, but is out for weeks, weeks at least, it looks like. Um, Trayori and oh, sorry, Grant Jaca still out as well, just in case anyone still has him. Um, West Ham apparently have some injuries, but there's no clear idea on what those injuries are. Nuno's kind of kept that a bit secret. Have some um secret injuries from West Ham. Um, oh, Bournemouth. Bournemouth from a press conference from Bournemouth. Bournemouth are going to rotate a little bit apparently. Don't know who, but maybe worries me a little bit about Hill. Um although maybe it should worry Sessi is just as much because Hill is playing very well at the moment. Bournemouth are expected to rotate a bit and uh I don't really know what else was particularly interesting um to be honest. Uh oh, John Stones is back. Uh he was training last last week. Uh and and Kusenov's available as well following his little issue last week. So Kusenov are available. I don't know if that worries uh Mark Gayhei owners at all. Um maybe it should. Uh would you start creepy then? I guess off the back of the Bournemouth thing. Um, it's got to be something to worry about a little bit, but I think mostly the the form of rotation was kind of hinted at because of fatigue. And given that Krooppy is kind of getting pretty early subs every game, he he's probably not one of the players who is probably most in danger of of uh having a a fatigue related benching if that makes sense. So, he's probably just going to play another uh 60 minutes. Hi, Dan. team is Reya De Bravka, Gabrielle Alati Hill, Roland Collins, and Burmo, Bruno Rogers, Wilson, next DK Harland. You is a third Arsenal slot necessary? I think a third Arsenal pick is going to be necessary. Yeah. Um how you go about that, I'm not exactly sure. Um depends how much money you have in the bank. I guess a defender could come in if you can afford to get to Timber or Celiba. Um, not really sure how you're going to get Declan Rice in. You could maybe do Ech to Jockarez as well. Um, if not, is is Rogers to Is Rogers to Rice the one? I don't know. Maybe maybe. But so so you do have some options there. Um, but I would I would do it. I would get that third Arsenal guy. Sir, with the super chat here says, \"Have five free transfers but cannot afford Minor in one move. I can do ciao to Laqua. Uh or should I downgrade Pigford? I mean, you could do um you could do Chiao to be fair, I don't really see the benefit of going for Laqua over Richards given that there is a bit of a price gap there. So, I would go for Richards, sure, over over Laqua, I think. Um yeah, as long as you got your three Arsenal settled, I don't think you need to go too crazy with the transfers. or if you do really want Munoz, make two transfers. If you've got, you say you're open to downgrading Pikford, I'm not exactly sure where I would go to from Pikford. Um, so that's kind of a difficult one. I'm like, who even are the good goalkeepers? I guess Keller from next week looks pretty good. Um, but you probably not the best jumping on point now. Or or to be fair, you could do pick for to Kellaher now and um play to Brava this week potentially as well. That's going to be a possibility. Um that's probably the best I can think of off the top of my head. Really struggling with goalkeepers at the moment to be honest. So difficult to pick them out. Uh Matias says, \"Mr. Deadline on Friday. Was sick in bed. I know it's a huge ask, but if you could look over my team uploaded earlier today to the G Drive.\" Yes, Matias, I will look at your team and any other uh starting 11 tier members. If you just pop your team in the in the Google Drive, I will have a look at it um whilst we've got time sort of in the next hour. Well, within the next hour, I mean. Uh Abdul with the super chat here says Casemiro or Ghana trying to replace Subs? No, neither really. Um, if you're replacing Sasly, I would say that the obvious move is probably is Milasar. I would say not really sure who else I'd really go for in that kind of price bracket. I mean, unless you just you want to go you want to go really cheap and you want to go for like a Anderson or something. Well, not really cheap, but pretty cheap. Anderson, Jupy Hall potential. there is potential there. So that's kind of uh maybe where I'd be looking to go retreat cheap midfielder, but it's minus first of all and that should be affordable, right? So lie to let's see I'm I've not actually owned Soai at all this season, so I don't actually know for sure how much he is. Um but I'm guessing like around 6.5, right? 6.7. Okay. Okay. Well, yeah, that's a pretty simple switch there. And SAR is what? 6.3. Yeah. So, yeah, that's going to be a pretty easy move. If if you're replacing subs, then SAR, unless you're trying to free up a bit of money, in which case I'd just go to Anderson. I think Anderson is just, you know, Mr. Reliable at this point. Um, a pretty a pretty simple one. All in all, Mark says, \"At top 100k rank, if I just captain Gabrielle, if he returns, does it hurt my rank?\" I don't know. I don't know yet. Um, I mean, we can get an idea in the chat of how many people will be triple captaining this week. So, um, are you using the triple captain ship this game week? Uh, and I'll put yes on um yes on Gabrielle, yes on Rice, yes on someone else. And just no is the other answer I suppose. So we get a rough idea on not just how many people are triple captaining, but also where those chips are going. Um, but I have my trouble captain on right now. It's It's activated. It's activated. Has been for a couple of days now. Why not just keep So I mean, you could if you wanted to. Um, I just think there are probably better options out there right now. Um, to be honest, I mean, I'm going to be making some midfield I'm probably going to make two midfield transfers in the next couple of game weeks. Subs is not really even making top 10 for me. There's just I think our our standard our expectations from midfielders just needs to be really high at the moment and because just because there are so many incredible options. There's so many midfielders I want and I know I'm not going to be able to get all of them. It's so frustrating. I want Wilson. I want Ryan. I want Atara. I want Vets. Um and some other guys as well. Rogers. I'd like to have Rogers. How am I going to get all of these guys in my team? I'm simply not. I'm simply not. So, probably looking at selling Rice soon. Probably looking at selling Enzo soon. I mean, maybe in Burmo, but I mean, there's no strong reason to selling Burma right now. It's tough. It's tough. And I've got to upgrade Obi as well at some point. Ready for Gameweek 31. Max said, \"How many gameweek 31 non-players would it take to dissuade you from Tarovski to Minos? I have triple Harland and triple Arsenal, triple Arsenal, Harland, and Gu.\" Uh, non-playing players, how many I mean, if you only have triple Arsenal and Harland and Gu, you're in the same situation as me pretty much. So, I have Obi instead of Gu. And I'm bringing in a new Crystal Palace player this week and it's going to be fine. So, yeah. I it helps when one of your Arsenal players is Rya to be fair. That does genuinely help, but um yeah, I think you should be okay to go for one more. The Australia with a super chat the eur a super chat in Euros despite being called Australia. Uh says, \"Hi Dan, on the fence about triple captain Gabrielle. Do you think there will be better any better double game weeks later in the season? Head is melted.\" Yeah, we've done a lot of content around that this week to be honest. the Australia, but I'm happy to whiz through it quickly for you today. So, uh, I have here my Dublin blank gameweek spreadsheet and I think probably this is the best area to focus on to start off with. So, um, really we've got a double game week 26. We know that's happening. That's sorted. we're going to get a double game week in 33 which almost certainly almost certainly um is going to be a double game week like I'm 99.9% sure there is going to be some double gameweek fixtures in 33 and it should be the biggest double gameweek of the season and therefore unless you've already bench boosted or are planning on bench boosting before gameweek 33 gameweek 33 just looks like such an obvious um bench boost week, particularly if there are a lot of double game weeks, which we have high potential for. There's to be a lot of double game weeks because of the way everything has landed. So, yeah, it's going to be um it's going to be an interesting one. Uh it's going to be the biggest double game week of the season, no matter how we frame it. And uh yeah, that is just that's just your bench boost week or you know, maybe a free hit week. you know, you could maybe spin it and be a free hit week, but unless you've already used some of your chips, um it's unlikely to be a triple captain week, but if you have used some of your chips or you are going to kind of splurge a few of them early, which want to go on record and say I don't recommend, um then gameweek 33 could in that those unique circumstances be a be a triple captain opportunity, but want to try and avoid it really. Gameweek 36 is the next opportunity and I think it looks reasonably likely that uh Man City will have a double gameweek there. As long as Man City reach the or or Burnley, Man City or Burnley, if one of those two teams reaches the FA Cup semi-final, it looks pretty likely that Man City will have a second double gameweek in gameweek 36. And that would be your prime candidate for a second opportunity uh for the triple captain. So it would be in gameweek 36 it would be Brent it would be Man City against Brenford at home and either Crystal Palace at home or Burnley away. I'm really stuck between which one it will be and I guess it depends on some other things that that happen over the next kind of few weeks maybe even week uh because we've got FA Cup games this weekend which is going to really help to narrow things down but that doesn't help us right now when we're trying to when we're hovering over the triple captain button right now. um you know whatever happens this weekend is not useful to us. So realistic expectations gameweek 36 um there are is some potential for a gameweek 37 double gameweek some niche scenarios but it is still so open in that regard so many things need to happen in a certain way in cup um European games in FA Cup games certain teams need to go through etc etc that I don't really think it's worth talking about too much and even so I still think there's a good chance that fixtures just move into gameweek 26. So, in short, what are the alternative triple captain weeks aside from gameweek 26? You could do gameweek 33, but I would rather use a different ship there. A different ship would be far more powerful there. In gameweek 36 looks like the next best opportunity in terms of single game weeks, there's not really much going on to be honest. Um, not really seeing a particular week that stands out for Harland, for example. Um, you know, there's there's is there anything for Bruno? Not really. Leads at home in 32 maybe if you're not wild card in 32 if as a single game week. I don't know. I don't know, man. Not really seeing single game week opportunities to be honest. So, uh, yeah, I'm going to I'm going to basically say triple captain now. The next opportunity is probably going to be game 86. So, there we go. Um, hopefully that helps. Um, but, you know, if it helps, I'm triple captioning now because there's just too many variables for gameweek 36. The double is not guaranteed. It's just the most likely this it's just the second most uh likely opportunity after gameweek 26. Um because I think gaming 33 is a is a non- opportunity. I think it's a hindrance. I don't know. Maybe that helps. Maybe that helps. Uh Chris says, \"Rice and vanventa, Timbar, Triple Captain, and Sar.\" No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Um you Yeah, Rice is fine. Can we not just move Vanerven in this, you know, just one transfer for Vaneran to know Richards Manurs Hill, Sessi, someone like that? That's probably what I would do. I mean, unless you really really want to triple captain Timber, but if you've got Gabrielle and you've got Rice, I'm not as keen on Rice really, but if you've got Gabrielle and you want to triple captain him, then I think that's probably the move. Abdul says minus four to replace Kat Lewin with Mane from Wolves. No, don't think I'd do it. I think honestly Mane probably gets a four-pointer this weekend. This this game week and best scenario really for Mane is like a seven pointer maybe if he can manage an assist. Maybe a little speculative. Rei says Timberle captain. Have I lost it entirely? It's up to you. Do you do you like Timber Gabrielle is the question. Um I don't. I don't. I prefer Gabrielle, but you know there's nobody's saying that Timber is a bad pick. Nobody's saying Timber is a bad pick. He's just a different pick to Gabrielle. Gabrielle ultimately has been the you know primary primary goal scorer out of the defenders are the best defconer the most nailed on for minutes and there's and there's just so and and bonus points does well for bonus points doesn't really get yellow cards. There's just so many points in the favor of Gabrielle versus Timber. What Timber does have is slightly better underlying numbers and maybe slightly better open play positioning or much better open play positioning, but he's so far not really managed to convert that because I don't think he's a particularly good finisher necessarily. Um, so there are more points in the favor of of Gabrielle Gabrielle, but Timber is still a good pick. If you genuinely prefer Timber to Gabrielle or indeed you don't have Gabrielle, um then you definitely could too. Definitely could. Sean says, \"Dan, which one will you bench? Uh Mane, Pedro, or Enzo?\" Well, you're definitely not going to bench uh Pedro or Enzo. So, you got to bench Mané. You can't bench your Chelsea players this week, unfortunately. Leads at home. It's uh the fixture is too good. Uh, Javy says, \"Play Tarovski or Mane or transfer to Minor.\" H um, what would I do there? Probably transfer to Menurs. I'd probably transfer to Minor if I'm honest. But that is a little luxury of a move. There's a little luxury. Stuart asks about news on Sacka. None. Unfortunately, the Arsenal press conference is not until after the FPL deadline, so we won't get an update there, unfortunately. Would you take a hit to sell Tarovski and get? No. No, I wouldn't. Burma injured. Um, I think he's going to be fine. I think he's going to be fine. He's trained. So, are you doing Shouted Riches before deadline? I am indeed. I haven't done it yet. Um to be honest, um I was waiting for Crystal Palace press conference, but that's all done now. Um and it looks like it's the same players are going to be available from last week to this new gameweek. Um the only thing I was kind of w wondering about is is Brenford and Collins. I don't actually know when the Brenford press conference is. Was it yesterday? Does anyone know when the press when the Brenford press conference was? I'm not sure. Or is it not happening until after the deadline? I've not seen any notes anywhere though and I'm not seeing it come up my usual feeds today unless it's unless it's this afternoon. That's the only other thing. Uh, right. What else we got here? Uh, I'm not in the habit of watching Everton games. Where has this Tarovski falloff come from? I mean, I think maybe a a slight switch in tactics um has meant that Tarovski is getting less defensive contributions and we've seen that last couple of game weeks with kind of more center backs on the pitch kind of thing. Um, but I think the main thing is the clean sheets have dried up, right? And with Everton, they were a team and you know this is something that we we kind have spoken about in videos. Um Everton have not looked good defensively for quite some time now. And you know they've been quite fortunate in a lot of the clean sheets that they they were kind of keeping um a few weeks back I suppose now when now that the kind of um the luck has or the good fortune has dried up. Well, we're back to normal and they're conceding goals in situations where yeah, they're kind of expected to concede goals. They're conceding a lot of chances. Of course, they're going to concede goals. It was strange when they weren't conceding goals. And now things are kind of getting back to normal. So, I don't think it's a falloff, but more so things are just regressing to mean a little bit and looking a bit a little bit more how we would expect from a kind of data perspective. So yeah, Everton just not that good of a defense and now it's kind of showing unfortunately. Do I just need to make this transfer now so people stop asking me about when I'm why I haven't done ciao to riches and what I'm doing there? I just wanted to just wait and see if there's there's um anything on Collins. Is there anything? Let's just Google it. Brenford Press conference. Right. When is the next one? Um, there's none available to look at right now. I don't know. I don't know. There we go. Tim, I only answer this question if you put in as a super chat. Uh, hi mate. Tim here is is top 10k ranked good. Triple captain Gabrielle. Good luck on your triple captain Gabrielle. Tim has been top 10k every week for his entire FPL career. Apparently, he's an impressive run in the top 10k. I wonder if he'll ever push on to some higher ranks or just kind of stay around top 10k. Have to wait and see. We'll have to wait and see. VJ with the super chat here says Rya Timber, Taroski, Richards, Anderson, Muki, Bruno Wilson, Rice, Enzo, Chucky, Harland, Watkins, Guers, 3 million in the bank. Shall I remove Cherokee, Taroski or Watkins or Ro maybe bring in Hill Rogers, Echk? I mean, I wouldn't sell Rock Watkins. I think he's fine to keep and indeed play uh this game week. Um, what you may be looking at, you may be looking at Cherokee to someone. Turkey to Vert. Turkey tombmo. Turkey to Sar. I think that's probably what I'd do. Or Turkey to Rogers. You mentioned Rogers as a player you like as well. Um, yeah. I I don't I don't know which which player you prefer out of those, but I think yeah, Churkey would be the move I would make out of those. And that should really help to improve your midfield there. I think Turkey is just just frustrating, isn't he? Just a frustrating FBO asset. And look, there's every chance he starts against Fulham and and scores and whatever, but like is it worth the risk? Is it worth the stress? Is it worth the drama every single game week? Probably not, right? So, I think that's what I would do. Just get it done. Get a player you're confident in and move on. Um, I'd be less keen to bring in Minos or someone like that because you already have Richards. could go for Hill potentially if you want to as well or Sessi. Um maybe save some money to upgrade Gu even to Thiago next game week. That's what I'm looking to do next week maybe or maybe the week after, but probably next week I'm going to be doing Chidowobi to Thiago. Looking forward to that one. So there you go. Those are some suggestions. Belinda says, \"Hey, Thiago versus Anderson. Uh, I'm as an Arsenal lover, um, I'm going to go Anderson over Thiago this week. The only, um, kind of reason to maybe go for Thiago is to kind of hedge against your Arsenal defenders and kind of treat it as a, you know, a win-win scenario. That doesn't really work like that necessarily. So, there we go. Um, I would play Anderson, but yeah, could hedge. Could potentially hedge, right? What else we got here? Uh, bench list. We'll do bench list um at the hour mark. So, we'll start that off at 5. I like to start the bench list an hour before uh deadline just to just so we can uh do whatever else we need to do first. Um, triple captain Rice thoughts. I mean, it's not something I would do. If I didn't have Gabrielle, the triple captain, I would probably just save my triple captain. If it's me, if it's my team, at least. So, there we go. Um, right. Uh, let's do some members team ratings. Now, I can't promise I'm going to do all of them, to be honest, because, uh, yeah, tight deadlines, deadline stream. We'll do our best. We'll do we'll do a few. Um this was uh this is coming this morning. What's the what's the note here? Trying to mimic your team as much as possible. Don't I'm going to go ahead and say don't try and do that necessarily. Um I I one it's not fun um to copy you know someone else's team but uh also you shouldn't tie your your value to mine. You want to go for your own achievements, right? Um but yeah, sacker to rice seems obvious. So yeah, that does help get your team more towards mine. Um yeah, how many free transfer did you say? I don't know how if you miss last deadline I guess you have two free transfers. So Saka Rice Bow into I'd probably do Vitz or Rogers. Um you could do Burma as well if you really did want to get your team close to mine. Um yeah, something like that. Something like that. again that that probably just brings your team closer to mine to be honest. Um but yeah, that's what I would do. Saka Foden, those are your priority transfers out. Chiao could could probably go as well. Um Thiago, if you can create a scenario where you bench Thiago, good, but I don't think that's going to be possible depending on how many transfers you have. Super chat from Sid Vicious have 3.3 million by Manurs for Van Heeka or Tarovski. uh Tarovski I think just cuz you save yourself a bit of money and if Van Hecka's back or if he can return then it's not a bad fixture this week right so who are Brighton playing they're playing never look at Brighton fixtures because I just have zero interest in them uh for my own FPL team away okay yeah maybe not um it was last week they had the nice fixture wasn't Uh so right this is K's team my Everton players need to go soon even with Bourne for home I will be benching one and giant given their fixtures uh a short-term ple or SARS tempting not both I would then get Hill or Anderson or some some of the other guys in gameweek 27 for the other Everton players give me six transfers left gameweek 31 to need to get needing four to get a playing 11 I have exact money to swap my Everton duo to Hill and Burmo or could get vert instead. Um, third option is to do gear to Thiago and game 27. Finding out would mean I get Hill and Jupiter Hall or Anderson. If Daros, I'll probably roll on 26 and do 27. Uh, yeah, I think getting you up to a Thiago is probably your priority. Maybe just cuz it solves an issue in gaming 31. So maybe I would prepare to do that. I mean, this team ultimately doesn't really need any transfers. So I wouldn't rush them in. You mean you've got Laqua, so I don't think you really need Munoz and Saw. Um, you say you got a Bench and Everton player. Maybe make that Tarovski and play in Jai. That's probably what I would do. Yeah, this team this team is a roll. Reevaluate next week. Got Scott's team here. Um, who likes to look at the team? Just wondering what goalkeeper to start really. Um, would I would I play would I play Dravkar over Bugen? I don't know that I would, you know. It's tight, isn't it? Um, I guess. Okay. I guess maybe it would, but it be it would be really close. That's a toin cost kind of scenario, isn't it? Um, okay. Yeah. Play to Braval Carro Bugum only because it's only Sar in the Crystal Palace attack that's doing anything right now. Yep. Rest of the team looks good. Good to go. I mean, if you got your triple up on Arsenal, you're pretty much good to go. Mafon says, \"You've convinced me to triple captain.\" Gabrielle, thinking of rolling um or making a goalkeeper transfer. Don't think you really need a goalkeeper transfer. You can just play to Bravka this week. Um yeah, aside from that, team looks strong. Yeah, I don't think this needs a transfer. Team's in a good shape. No, no changes other than swap goalkeepers to Bravkar on roughs on the bench. Although saying that, saying that Sunderland are pretty good at home. Nah, surely not. It's Liverpool. Come on, let's be sensible here. Let's think smart. All right, Ali's team. And we got a super chat whilst uh whilst we just wait there. Uh from EAC who says, \"Thanks for an amazing YouTube. How many minutes do you think Mawa gets between both Arsenal games? I have him, Timber Gabrielle, one transfer, 0.3 million. Um, honest answer, think you do well to get 120 minutes. I think that would be a success if you get 120 minutes from him. Um, I'm not totally convinced, but you know, you just got to hope during those minutes he does he does do something or whether that's a corner taken that's kind of knocked in by hopefully Gabrielle. Um, I don't know. Um, but yeah, it's it's he's fine. Yeah, I think if you already have Madek, I wouldn't be looking to move him out, but not I don't know. Maybe maybe it's my own kind of profile of FPL asset I like to own, but Madd is not ideal. the the the big problem with Mekke is if Saka returns a little bit sooner than expected. If Saka's back for the second game in the double game week, then Mawke is being is going to be in uh big big trouble. Um but there's every chance that you know even if Saka's not back, we see one game where Arsenal play kind of Trosard and Martinelli on each wing or you know maybe someone else out out wide and that's the difficulty with Mawa. You just don't know. And the fact that the second game is so far away, the fact that even the first game is a couple of days away and there's been no press conference, it's very very difficult to come up with an accurate prediction, I suppose. So there we go. Matias says, \"Dan, thanks for the suggestions. If I do Saka to Rise and Foden tomb and burn, I still have 2 million left.\" It's not necessarily a bad thing. Definitely not a bad thing. No, I've got How much money have I got in the bank? I think after I make my I think I have 3.8 8 million in my bank after I make the child transfer, which is yeah, 3.8 million, which is loads, but it's fine. I want to have money in the bank because I want to upgrade Obi. I want to swap Rice out. I want to swap Enzo out. Um, I might even have to swap Collins out at some point as well. So there's um there's plenty of things in the future that we can be spending our saved money on. Right. So do we do team um three free transfers and four in the bank? This team, what does it need? It needs needs a tavern transfer, doesn't it? It needs a tavern upgrade. I'll do Tava tomb and Burmo Vertz or Rogers. One of those guys. That's what I would do, I think. Or you can go for another cheap if you if you fancy upgrading Obi to Thiago next game week. You could also just do Taer to a to a S. Maybe someone a bit more similarly priced to help fund the Obi upgrade. Or, you know, you go even cheaper. You go Anderson, you go Jbury Hall, something like that. All of them would work, I think. But ideally, you would buy someone to replace Anderson this week to allow you to bench Malik Chow this week, but I wouldn't use three transfers. I'd just use one this week. I think I'd probably play, would I play Wilson? I probably would play Wilson. Man City can be got at Trash Panda says I need to get a third Arsenal player. How are we going to do that then? Um, I think I'd just do pick for Terraa to be honest. You don't need double um or or Tarovski to to Timber. One or one of those. I think that's pretty straightforward. You don't need double Everton defense anymore. Um, at all really. What would I lean towards? Um, is Gabriel Chalaba, Nunz all playable this week? Okay, if you were to do Tarovski to Timber that would allow you a pretty nice four 42 and you can bench Wilson and Thiago if you wanted to. Alternatively, is the is it the better idea to actually just because you've got quite a strong attack, is it better to go picky? That would allow you to hide Rya in gameweek 31 on the blank gameweek. Maybe that's what I'll do. Write on the notes, but I'm really leaning towards Alder to Manurs and Jar Pedro to have there is no way I would sell Jar Pedro over the next two game weeks. Not a chance. Um now leadeds and Burnley I would I'm thinking about you know those people who will be captaining Jah Pedro in gameweek 27. So definitely wouldn't be doing that if you I mean look listen if you really really do want Havs in your in your team then I can't stop you. But um no it's not something I would even nearly consider if if this were my team. Um an Alderi to Mos. Do you need it? Do you need to have all five of your defenders cost over 5.4 million? It's too much money in defense considering the the wealth of cheap defenders right now. So, I don't think I would do that either. Um, yeah, I think if it's my team, I'm probably doing pick for Terra, but I also like Tarovski to Timber. And that's pretty much as far as I would go there. I'd save the extra transfer. I'd roll it on and that's pretty much what I would do. Yeah, but if you really want to do Pedro to have it, I can't stop you. Jessel says, \"Child to Hill. Any other suggestions?\" Um, I do like that. I mean, you could just go Richards. Chow to Richards maybe or mining to someone. May to star. If this is my team, what am I actually realistically doing here? I'm playing Rya. I'm playing Gabrielle O'Reilly, Kenate. I'm benching Chia Mukulele. Um, uh, yeah. Yeah, if this is my team, I'm probably doing Mayu Tasar. That's what I would do if it was my team. I don't know if that's the answer. You're probably not the answer you wanted to hear because every week you you have Minho on your team and every week I suggest some replacements for him. Um, and he's and yes, he's still here. So maybe there is an attachment there, but I can only tell you what I would do if it were my team. TomTom says, \"Wilson against Man City or Croo Jun against Everton?\" I think I'd play Wilson if it were my team. Yeah, I do Wilson. Play Thiago or Obie? It's a lose-lose. I don't know. Obie's going to get zero points. Thiago is going to get at least two. It's not bad. Could be a lot worse. Um, hey, I have Ekki on the bench. Who do I drop for him, Samuel or Pedro? No one. You keep Ekit on the bench. We're going to do a bench list fairly soon. So, um, hopefully we'll cover a lot of bench related questions. Um, we have I believe we've done all of our rate my teams. If there's any other members in the uh in the chat who do want a team rating, please do feel free to go ahead and uh if you want to join as a member as well, um you absolutely can do. Um joining as a member gives you access to a whole bunch of stuff. For example, the 100 experts video that was that went up this morning was actually available to members from like last night. Um, I didn't want to upload them publicly to no I didn't want to upload that video publicly too soon after the team selection video. So, I delayed it till this morning for everyone, but members typically will watch the video regardless. And, uh, therefore, I just put it up for members early. So, you're going to get early videos sometimes. Um, member streams, we do that most game weeks unless there's midweek games, which makes things difficult. Get access to the my planning uh, sheets as well. go join the private mini league and uh yeah, loads of other stuff. So, if you do want to join as a member, you can get your team rated straight away from today. And uh yes, but uh yeah, that's uh that's going to be at the starting 11 tier or above. And members, if you do drop your team in the uh the Google Drive, let me know. Let me know you've done it. Um flag it to me so I can have a look. Right. Anyway, back to business. I don't know what happened there. We had a bit of a lag on the transition, but Patrick says Columbus Cheese Heads and Jai and Stack out. Stack and Rogers in. Patrick, what does this mean, my friend? And Ji and Stack out. Stack and Rogers in. H Scott, yes you can. Yes, you can, my friend. Um, still trying to work out why there's two stacks. It's got to be It's got to mean someone else, right? Maybe someone cheaper. Who's real? Patrick, let me know. Uh, any wild card draft you can suggest? Yes. My advice on the wild card is to not use it. To be totally honest with you, I'd rather take like a minus eight than use a wild card. Oh, Anderson and Rogers. Oh, yeah. Okay. Um, yeah. Yeah, why not? If you want to. I don't think I, you know, I wouldn't do those moves for a hit. Um, I don't feel very particularly strongly about those moves. It's not something I'd be desperate to do necessarily, but yeah, if you prefer Anderson and Rogers, then absolutely go for it. Absolutely go for it. Uh, high, would you play DCL over Chaliba if you had them? Um, DCL is potentially ill, but no, I would play Chalibur. I play Chalibur. Timber to hill to fund over to Thiago and rice to V. Yeah, I like it. I like it for free. I like it. And it definitely improves your team, doesn't it? And it also helps you for game 31 as well. A lot actually. Cool. There we go. Zacharias says I added Richards uh on what's really first in the mini league uh as Mos or maybe for O'Reilly. I hate I don't have Villa or Palace attacker. Nah, it's not worth selling on Burmore or Enzo. Super chat from Trash Panda says first. Thank you your work and streams. They keep me saying it work. Good to know. Good to know. Also, I really want Minos. If not Aldereti, who would you kick out of my team from Chaloba Tarovski or Matas Nunes? I guess Tarovski, but like your priority is getting your triple Arsenal, right? Triple Arsenal is the priority. You could always if you wanted you to two do two transfers. Easy for me to say. Um, you could always do Tarovski to Mos and pick Vera. You can always do that. Yeah. But if you, you know, out of your defenders, your many many plethora of expensive defenders, Tarovski would be the first to go for me. But as triple up on Arsenal is the priority. That's like for everyone for everyone. Uh, Summit or Nothing says, \"Damn, what's the best free hit team this week? Haven't uh really seen it. Love the channel. Gets me through cardio at the gym.\" Good to hear, my friend. Good to hear. Um, however, I really, really would not recommend a free hit this week. I really wouldn't. Um, there's going to be so many better opportunities to use it. Um, there really is. So, yeah, this would probably be like, I don't know, something like the eighth best week to triple cap, uh, sorry, to free hit or something like that. It can't be worth it surely, unless your team just wasn't set up for this week at all. Um, so yeah, the best free hit is to not free hit. Um, the second best is triple up on Arsenal, triple up on Crystal Palace. Uh, probably at least two Man United, one or two Chelsea, and that would pretty much do you. Oh, and some Man City. You'd have a little bit of Man City in there as well. Probably Harland, maybe more. Not sure. Not sure, but something like that. FPL Vince, by the way, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel. Feel free to upload your team into the Google Drive, which can be found on my channel homepage, but only members at the starting 11 tier or above will be able to see that um that drive link and then you can just upload a screenshot of your team in there. Uh, hey Dan, what cheap defenders would you recommend? Um, Richard and Hill pretty much. Riches is 4.4, Hill is 3.9. I like both of them. Um, kind of backed up by the fact that I have both of them or at least will have both of them by the time we hit the deadline today. Bench list coming in 20 minutes. one sp with the 22 cent super chat. Uh, thank you very much for that. Um, I'll no message attached. I think there is a minimum spend to add a a message to chats. That is not enforced by me. That is enforced by YouTube. So, apologies for that. But I appreciate it regardless. I do appreciate that. Uh, should we see if there's any other rate my teams? No, there's not. That's fine. Keep it there. Just in case I'm going to need a new need a new orange squash in a minute. Joe's got the triple captain activated. 500% clean sheet coverage. Wait, so you're triple Arsenal defense, triple captain, Gabrielle. Oh my word. Remarkable. Remarkable. Would you buy a Strand Lson instead of Q if you had free transfers instead of the wild card? Um, it wouldn't impact me the wild cards. Uh, if you have free transfers, that is impactful though. Um, would I buy Shan Lson? Um, maybe we need to see. Well, I kind of want to see something from him. I guess the best time to buy is when the fixtures are good. It's a shame that he hasn't really shown much for Palace so far. Not that he's really had it very much time to do so. Um, yeah, man. It's it's it's it's a tough buy. You could do you could do I wouldn't I wouldn't rule it out. Um, if you're keen and if you do want to get that that additional forward in your team, then yeah, also depends who you're selling, right? Captain Yarez, is it a bad idea on a free hit? I don't I think captaining Yarez is a risky idea. We'll put it that way. I mean, going through the polls so far, 63% of you are triple captaining Gabrielle. 6% of you are triple captaining Rice. 4% of you are triple captaining someone else. And only 26% of you guys are not using the triple captain ship this week, which I find a little bit mad. Is it really that little? Are we really that heavy on triple captain this week? I didn't think it would be this heavy on Triple Captain to be honest. Unless some people are misreading the uh the uh question, the poll question. Thoughts on transferring Vanderventan out for Richards? Yep. Like it. Like it. Rice for Rogers. Uh I already have Ray and Gabrielle. H I don't love it. I don't love it to be fair. I'd be looking to remove a player I didn't want to have long term. And I think Rogers is a player I'd want to have long long term. Ross says bench Hill or Thiago. The Arsenal fan in me says bench Thiago. Hill has the higher ceiling. I think there's a good chance Hill conceds, but you know, Defcon is always um a possibility there. Four pointer, whereas Thiago, we're probably going to get a two-pointer if we're honest. Treble captain this week, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Too uh many things could prevent a better option later. Agreed, Carl. Absolutely agreed. which is exactly why I'm going to be triple captaining Gabrielle this game week. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Play Vert or Gayhee. Oh, that's a tough one. I guess you got to play Vert, right? I need to ask my wife if she wouldn't mind grabbing me a drink, but I don't think she's home. Let's check. Let's track her location. Oh, yeah. She is nowhere near home. Anyway, where were we? Right. Uh, would you play Enzo or Rogers? Enzo. I think I heard someone talking about how Timber has a ceiling as a triple captain. I don't think uh Timber has a higher ceiling than Gabrielle because Timber doesn't get defensive contributions. So if you're saying that Timber and Gabrielle, even if you say they have similar, you know, goal threat, attacking potential, whatever, then Gabrielle's still more likely to get Defcon and therefore that improves the ceiling. Huan says, \"Will Yakarez play both games?\" Honest answer, don't know. Um, yeah, the the the second game, well, the first game is not for another couple of days. The second game is not for another week, and it's so difficult to say right now. There's there's going to be a game in between those two as well in the FA Cup. So, it's so hard to get a judgment on what will happen in the second game. If I had to guess, I'd say he starts one game and is maybe on the bench for the other. But if he, you know, if he plays well in the first game, gets another goal, why not why not why why can't he start the second game? So, I think there's a chance of both happening. Uh this is this and and this is the exact problem. This is why I'm just saying just pick three out of Rya, Gabrielle, Rice, Timber. Just pick three out of those four. You know what you're getting. You can feel confident. You can feel happy. Everything's great. Everyone else is has some kind of question mark that nobody can answer. Mal Arteta doesn't know if if he's going to start Yokarez in the second game of the double gameweek yet. Probably has a good idea for the first game and he probably will start for the second game. Yeah. If the man if if we're in a situation where the manager probably doesn't know if they a player is going to start in the second game or not, then what hope do we have as FPL managers really? which is why I just don't want to play that game personally. When will we know about the when the teams will uh blank in game day four? We will know. Um let me just find my chart. Uh no FPL double game calendar. So, I really like my calendar. So, we will find out for 100% by not until the game 32 deadline. Is that right? Yeah. Wait. Yes. Yeah. We'll find out for 100% who blanks in gameweek 34 and indeed who doubles in 33. not until after the gameweek 31 deadline and indeed after the international break. So you're looking at like this is going to be something like the 5th of April or something like that before we find out. So two months away before we find out who's going to be doubling in 33 and blanking in 34 at least. That's when we'll know for sure. We'll have a good idea. Well, we'll have a better idea by uh by this weekend. We'll have an even better idea than that by the gameweek 30 deadline and then we'll have that verified by the gameweek 32 deadline. So, lots of variable lots of variables in play still. Lots of variables in play. Uh, good afternoon, Dan. What are your thoughts on Wilson? Should I sell for Enzo? No. If I didn't have Enzo already, I wouldn't be buying him anymore. In fact, that pretty much goes for all Chelsea players. If you haven't already got them, it's maybe too late. Maybe. Unless you have a lot of transfers going at the moment and you can afford to move them in and out because any Chelsea player you're really only looking to keep for two game weeks and that's really is that worth a transfer? I don't know. The other thing is there's just with Enzo in particular, there's so many great midfield options. You don't have to go for one that only has two good fixtures when there are a bunch of others that have great fixtures all the way up until gameweek 31 inclusive. Salem says have two free transfers by Timber for Tarovski and Triple Arsenal defense or just Riceford and Jai. Uh, what will I do? Probably rice in forai to be honest. I don't do see anything more about fitness. Yeah, he's trained so I think that's a positive thing. Trained normally. So maybe it was just cramp or something um when he was spotted limping the other day. Rice or Zimbaby? Rice. Nob brainer. Hill or Chiao. Who to start? Hill. No. Rya. I have Rya. I like Rya. Is it worth using a wild card? No. I'd rather take a minus eight than use a wild card this game week. Although fingers crossed you won't need to take a minus eight. Rogers to Rice. or do I just go double Arsenal? Um, I would I would prioritize triple Arsenal. If if Rochester Rice is really genuinely the only way to resolve that that uh that Arsenal situation, then I guess that's what you do. I would look for another route though. Is free hit gameweek 31 a good idea? Not in my opinion, because gameweek 34 is going to be in theory a significantly bigger blank gameweek. So yeah, gameweek 34 is going to be problematic for a lot of FPL managers, I think. Um, and therefore, yeah, uh, you use your free hit in gameweek 31 or sorry, in 20, no, 31, right? Use your free hit in gameweek 31, you'll get to gameweek 34 and you'll probably regress it probably. Anyway, how do you find and buy hill so early? By the way, your process is crazy good for catching these cheap beasts. Thank you, my friend. I I kind of agree. Um, yeah, is I think one of my few strengths in in the game of FPL. Obviously, we can't get everything perfect, but something I feel like I do do okay with is uh yeah, identifying those cheaper FPL assets. Um really it's just keeping an eye on um well first of all I noticed he was playing which is always a good start. Uh I noticed he was playing every game. Um after that I was like okay this is interesting. Hang on. We'll just answer super chat. Scorpio says oh Riley and Sessi to Gabrielle and triple captain and heal for minus four. Is that really the only way? If it is then yes. If you're desperate to triple captain Gabrielle and that's the only way, then yes, do it, I guess. But it's an Essie to Hillfield sideways. Yeah, I just noticed he was playing um I checked his Defcon numbers. They were really, really good. I checked his um his player ratings on F Mob. They were really good. I checked then I checked press conference notes. um the manager Iola was praising him and you know it's sometimes it's just you see one thing and then that you think oh that's interesting let's you know let's deep dig it bit further and if you're convinced again then you dig a bit further if you're still convinced you dig further and then um and then it ended up really being me just being completely convinced by him. Um but that said look I think he is a good pick. I think he has good value for money, but I'm not going to deny the fact that picking up an assist, which is basically just a a regular pass to Ryan who ran up ran up the entire pitch and did scored a solo goal. That is a just luck really. And really gave me 25 was more like a four-point appeal, but still really good. Um, but yeah, another thing I noticed is his defcon is incredible, man. It's so so good. It's so good. It's better than Sessi. So, it was enough to convince me to go for him. Yeah, I guess the first step is seeing if a player is actually playing and then after that, okay, what are their defcon numbers like? That's always step two for me. When I notice a player looks interesting, check their defcon numbers. If they're strong and hills were really strong, then um then you could be on to something. Uh, CIA says, \"Hey, Dan, do you still have hope on Arsenal winning the league?\" Yeah, I mean, I think so. I think so. I don't see why not. Arsenal's uh league to lose really. So, I feel fairly confident there. Play Mane or Ryan. Oh, I'd maybe go for Mane because of the double game week and also because we are expecting some rotation from Bournemouth and that may come into play with Ryan. Not sure. Juan says, \"Love from India. Love the chip strategy video. Have been following you since gameweek 2. Upload um uh since gameweek 2. Upload on Spotify podcast please. Also, Bowen's echk or verts for a minus four.\" Uh no, I wouldn't take a minus four to remove Bowen. I'd rather just play Bowen to be honest than take a minus four. Um, upload to Spotify. People have asked me about uploading to Spotify before, but honestly, um I don't it's it's time consuming and I appreciate that a lot of you guys would enjoy it, but I'm not really sure how it benefits me or the channel because all it potentially does is siphon views away from YouTube to a place where I wouldn't be making money from the uploads And that obviously is important when doing this is literally my job. Um, so I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I mean maybe I'll go back on Spotify and do something, but I'm not I don't I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced. Maybe I need to speak to someone about it and how it all works. All or the other thing is with with Spotify is a lot of my videos are quite graphical based. Like always have graphics. I usually make graphics. Um you know I'm not a I'm not a slideshow FPL content creator. I'm making stuff all the time and animating things and all kinds. So um yeah, I just don't know if it's suited. But anyway, um wouldn't make the Bowen move. Uh at least not this week and not for minus four. David says, \"Is duel go to Richard's worth doing over starting Thiago?\" Yes. Yeah, I would do it. I would do it. Craig says, \"Gabrielle, Chaliba, Virgil Van Djke, Rodon, and Dorgu in my defense. Can't decide if I should sell Dorgu or roll again.\" Um, well, you can play Gabriel Chaliba Van Djk as long as your um as long as your uh attack is fine, I guess. Yeah, that would kind of be the the important factor there. If your attack is in good shape and you don't need to play a four at the back, then I think you could just stick with what you've got and just roll. But if you do feel feel you need an additional player then uh yeah Doo to Hill or Riches good work. Joe says, \"Love the graphics, Dan. One of the best visual storytellers in the FB space.\" Good to hear, Joe. Thank you very much. And Joe, I I also like your graphics as well. I like your your um micro animations. And I wish I knew how to do them better. I really do. Um because I am I think I'm good at Premiier Pro. I probably could do more on Premier Pro if I put more time into it, but I'm terrible at After Effects. So, a lot of the micro animations I just don't have the time nor energy to figure out. Um, and you do them really well, Joe. To an extent where I am jealous, where I'm jealous. And I wish I could include more stuff like that in my own videos. Um, because it's awesome. I love that kind of thing. But uh yeah, appreciate the uh the kind words regardless. Um Dominic uh thank you very much for coming for becoming a member of the channel. Absolute legend. Um if you want to upload your team for a rating, you can do so by uh going to my channel homepage, finding the Google Drive link, and uploading an image there. Beautiful stuff. Is it roughly know known which teams will have a double game at 36? The two most likely teams are Man City and Crystal Palace, but it's up in the air. But yeah, but those are the most likely teams. Could be some other teams as well. Could be no other teams. Could be no teams whatsoever potentially. We'll have to wait and see how many teams will be blanking uh approximately for game 34. Eight. Eight teams blanking. Benji says, \"Hill or Thiago?\" I'm sure Captain Gabrielle hoping Thiago blank. It's up to you. Do you want to hedge with Thiago and kind of try and play both sides that way you always come out on top or are you happy to go Hill? I would probably play Hill. I prefer to go all in, but uh I don't think there's a wrong answer there necessarily, and I think they'll probably they probably projected similar scores. I would go Hill though. Taster says, \"Bench one, Rogers, Nunez, Caliber, Anderson, Mane, Enzo.\" Is the answer Mané? It might It may well be. It's either Manet or Anderson, I think. Let's say one of them. Uh, it is officially 1 hour till deadline, by the way, guys. One, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel, my friend. Um, yeah, it's officially 1 hour till deadline, and that can only mean one thing. It means that we need to do a bench list. Oh, we've not done a bench list all day. We've not done one since the weekend. It's been way too long. We need one. B Sharp, thank you very much for the super sticker, my friend. Appreciate it. Mucho appreciate web app. I'm so curious to learn how that works. Interesting stuff, man. Maybe I could learn a thing or two from you, Joe, to be fair at this point. Uh Carl says up to eight teams blanketing in gameweek 34 for the uh semis unless if the semi-finalist play each other or other non Premier League teams get through. Yeah, exactly. Spot on, Carl. Spot on. Pop. Um, by the way, if you intended to include a message there, I will keep an eye out in this in the chat for any messages. So, don't don't worry about sending another super chat or anything like that. If you have a message, just put it in the chat as a normal chat and I will try and keep my eye out for it. Right, bench list. Bench list. Let's start it off. Is there any odds of cities doubling at 36? Um, the odds really are just the odds of Man City and Burnley's combined chances of getting to the FA Cup semi-finals and then also factoring in the Premier League doing some weird things, which is also very possible. And you have to then factor in uh European Cup stuff. It's hard to figure out, but it would be over 50% chance, well over 50% chance of I would say uh intuitively of City doubling in in gameweek 36. Well over it would be over 50%. Yeah. But there's also a scenario where Man City don't reach the FA Cup semi-finals and still double in 36. There's there's also that scenario, too. Um, but there we're just so early. There are just so many moving parts and I wish I could give you a more conclusive answer. I really wish I could, but there's so many variables and factors in play that need to be resolved before we can give a more accurate answer. And as each week goes by, we'll be able to get a more accurate answer. But I appreciate that that doesn't help you right now. And a lot of people need these answers right now, but they just don't exist sadly. Uni says, \"Are we trouble captain Gabriel or no?\" I mean, I am my friend. Um, kind of up to you. Alistister, thank you for the super sticker there as well. Uh P Sharp says, \"Cheers Dan Chaliba or Riches to start.\" Tough one. Let's um let's kick let's kick the bench list off with those guys, I guess. And I'm actually going to put Riches ahead of Chaloba. I'm actually going to put Riches ahead. Um Riches has slightly better clean sheet odds and is typically a slightly better defconer as well. So I think that leads me towards Riches over Chelan. I think leadeds are a decent team in attack. They are more than capable of scoring in any given game week. And Nicole says, \"Hi Dan, 73 points in game 25. Uploaded my team to drive.\" Nicole, you are you snuck in. Not really at the right moment because we were only doing the team ratings in the first hour. Um, but regardless, looking at your team, you already made your transfer, so it doesn't really look like you're looking for any advice anyway to be fair, my friend. And I think you look like you're good to go. So, uh, yes, good luck, Nicole. Good luck, my friend. Uh, Evok, uh, says uh, Cherokee or Ivo. No, that says Ivo. It doesn't say Evo. It says Ivo. says, \"Churkey for Rogers or Sar?\" If it's me, I'm going Saw. That's okay, Nicole. It's no problem. Um, yeah, I go for Saw as a Turkey replacement, personally, I think. Right. Anyway, bench list. Who's going on there? Who's going on there? Thiago's gone on apparently. I'm going to put him here. We're going to put Vugan and Dravka on because I know a few people have that very question. And I am going to marginally put Dra Da Dravka ahead of Vugan Vugan. Drafka Vrava Bugan Dugan Vravka Vdugan. Sorry, my my brain melted there trying to differentiate between names that don't look similar but are surprisingly difficult to say in tandem. Um, okay. Right. Mane is a big question this week, isn't he? I think I play him over the bugan to stean. We're talking about toen or the bugen or dravka. Um, O'Reilly. O'Reilly I put reasonably high this week. Would I put him above Chaliba? Probably not. But I think I put him above. It's that small rotation risk is going to drop O'Reilly down a little bit. But I think he's a reasonably decent pick. Defcon though. You know what? I'm going to drop him lower than Thiago. Uh, I will put play a player like Crooppy Jr. below though. I don't know if anyone asked for Crooppy Junior, but um if not, you can just tell me. Dan didn't ask. Nobody cares about Creepy Junior. And if so, I'll just throw him my hands up. Muki. Okay. Players like Alder, Muki, they're going lower. Not as low as someone like Collins. I would marginally put Chiao higher than these guys. marginally Sessi. I'm going to put Sessi and Hill together because I do think they are much of a muchness. And I'm going to put them here. Um, super chat from Jandre says, \"Hi Dan, I have one free transfer. Is Gu to Krooppy Jr. or Vanden Vandenberg to Sessi worth a transfer to start? Either of them had a Harry Wilson. Which one do you prefer if any? I mean, I'd be fine to play Harry Wilson for what it's worth. Um, due to creepy I wouldn't do personally. Vandenberg to Sessi. I would think about I but I would probably be more likely to do Vandenberg Vandenberg to Hill at this point. And if you already have Hill, then I wouldn't double up on the Bournemouth defense. The other option is to go for a Crystal Palace defender like Richards. And those are your options there. Oh, Cat Lewin hasn't traveled according to a lead in the no. Is that true? Hang on. Sorry. I am going to have to verify that. Uh what got Lu? The game's tonight, isn't it? Wait, no. Yeah, it is. Yeah, of course it is. Away from home. I don't know. I'm not seeing anything. Not seeing anything on Calum. It's on your forum. Um I don't know, man. It's not something I've seen before, so I can't just automatically trust it, unfortunately. 47 months, Jandre. Crazy stuff. You almost got You're almost on the 48th month badge. That's a long time. N8 the Great says, \"I have timber and rice. Should I use my one free transfer for XDK to Yarez? And if so, who should I captain? Is Yarez too bold? Triple captain? Yeah. Is there no way of getting Gabrielle and triple captioning him? Juan, please do not spam my friend. I will add Wilson in just one moment. Um, should I use should I use the one free transfer exas? Probably not. Probably not. Nate the Great. Um, I would try and get Gabrielle up. That is your priority. And I would, you know, if you only have one free transfer, I would probably even take a minus four to make it happen. So, if there's any defenders you don't like and maybe another player who you may have been thinking about transferring for a while. If you think you can improve your team using both of the two free transfers, including getting Gabrielle in, then that's what I would do personally. If you can't get Gabrielle in, if it was my personal team, I probably would just forego the triple captain entirely and wait for a future double gameweek. Wait to see what happens in gameweek 36. If you don't have Gabrielle, some argument to triple captain Timber. Um, I guess. Don't know, man. I don't know, man. So, Wilson Wilson needs to go here, doesn't it? Somewhere. I mean, like I said, I would be fairly willing to play Wilson. It wouldn't be top of my list, but you could play him if you wanted to. They're a worse place to play. Eat. I would play probably You got to play him above Mane, right? Something like this. Thoughts on Havits? Little risky for me, but uh I don't hate him as a pick to be fair. Emmanson and Bowen seem to be popular in the chat. Gandre says, \"Wife is anxiously shouting from the kitchen. Ask him if he would start RAL or Anderson.\" Got to love the women playing FPL. You got to love everyone playing FPL. Well, you got to love it indeed. Uh, why is she shouting? She she she got her own device. Hop on the stream. Ask me yourself, Mrs. uh Mrs. Jandre. Um, okay. So, Anderson or Ra? I feel like I'd probably play Anderson. And I think that's reasonably straightforward as well. Um, I'm going to put Anderson here on on the um on the bench list, but yeah, I would play him above. Um, there's another super chat here from Kash that says subs and sh replacements, please, Dan. Uh, okay. Could you do Sar and Hill? Freeing up a little bit of money actually for some future moves. Unless you already if unless you don't have Arsenal players in which case your your Arsenal guys are going to be your replacements but yeah assuming you have triple Arsenal already saw and Hill or you know you could if you can go up to like V or Burmo and Hill that would be an option there as well. Um you if you are not going for Sar I'd be more likely to go for someone like Richards or Mos as well. You could go a little cheaper in the midfielder position potentially there. So there you go. There are a whole bunch of options for you. All of which are great. Uh Yash says, \"Hey Dan, two free transfers. O'Reilly DCL to Minor Man worth it?\" Can you help me with stats for triple captain Rice? I'm not really sure what you're looking for stats wise. A rice is playing a little deeper at the moment, so he's probably not going to have as much attacking threat open play, but he's still on those set pieces, which is always helpful. Um, is O'Reilly and DL to Minor and Mané worth it? I mean, I'm not massively keen on the Mane transfer generally to be honest. So, I think, you know, he's probably going to get four to seven points this game week. More likely four, maybe even three. and he just causes you a problem in gamewick 31. So I don't know man why man not tou cuz man's cheaper. That's the only reason really people are going for mane. I think Marley is on set pieces but obviously to t to better open open play threat and potential penalties as well. I'm not sure who's going to be the penalty taker. Um, next Alistister says, \"Uh, hey Dan, should I start Anderson versus Wolves over Mano double game week?\" Uh, they're both on the bench list, my friend. So, hopefully that helps. We'll uh we'll throw in Verts as well maybe. But in terms of O'Reilly and DCL to Munoz and Mane, I don't think I would do it with two free transfers. I don't think I would. If you need an extra player, I mean, you can play O'Reillyy's perfectly playable this week. Zanna, not keen. Not keen. Right. We said we were going to do Bowen. We said we were going to do someone else. Who escapes my brain right now? Who was it? Remind me guys who I was going to put on the on the sheet. Right. Bowen first of all which is a toughish game really against Man United and the underlying numbers have not been great. I'm going to put Bowen mean similar situation to to Thiago where probably not going to have much open play threat but does have penalties. So I think in that but is a better fixture like Manchester United is obviously particularly at home is an easier fixture. So in that sense I maybe bump Bowen here. Super chat from Linus says stuck between Gayhei and Chalaba Enzo and Burmo. Buying or playing? I think I'd play. Would I play Gay overcalibur? Maybe not. No, probably not to be fair. Would I? It's tight. I maybe put Gay here. That helps. And like there's just no way you bench surely. And no way you bench in Burma either. You got to play both. Oh, Evan Nilson. That was the other player I was going to put on. Thank you for the reminder. So, Evan Nilson away to Everton. Um, he's got to be better than Thiago and Bowen, right? So, and we think there is a good chance that Evan Nilson's on penalties. So, does something like that make sense? Is there a tiny bit of rotation risk for Evan Nelson? Maybe. Maybe. Why would Shahal Petro go on the bench list? Why would you bench Schwar Pedro? Surely not. Surely surely not. Right. Floren Verts. Going to put him in a similar situation to Echk to be honest. Um, who would I put above? I'm going to put Verts above. What am I? I'm going to put They're pretty much on par. I'm going to put Verts and Echk on par. Just expensive Liverpool attackers altogether. All together. All right. Should we do some goalkeepers? Maybe Kellaha. Uh I mean I think that's a pretty obvious bench. Don't know what other goalkeepers people typically have at the moment. Um Sanchez. I guess people have Sanchez. You're going to play him above most of these guys. Um through some of these goalkeepers. Um sure some people have some Oh, Cells is out by the way. Cells is unavailable. Uh Ruffs. All right. Yeah, Ruffs is probably going even lower still. Oh, sorry. Even some of the other guys. Not lower than Kell. All right, Tarovski, are you on Pikford as well? Okay, let's do let's wrap up the goalkeepers with Pigford. Jo S, you're obviously going to play unless you have Rya. Uh, so he doesn't really need to go on the bench list. To be fair, Rya doesn't need to go on the bench list either to be fair. I don't know why he's on there. Nobody's thinking about benching him. Um, but yeah, Pigford, uh, a home to Bournemouth. You're probably going like here compared to some of these other guys. So above Dravka, right? Let's go back to the outfield players. We'll put Tarovski on here somewhere. Probably lower than Tessen Hill. Lower than Thiago. Maybe lower than O'Reilly. Maybe similar to O'Reilly. I'm going to go here. Okay, Keen. I mean, Keen's minutes are of some concern still, so I'm going to put him even lower. Van Dyk Virgil. Um, he's going to go maybe here. Is that right? It doesn't feel right, does it? Still doesn't feel right. Okay, that feels better. Enzo Lefay. Yeah, you're just not going to play Enzo Lefay realistically. Actually, you're more likely to play him than Collins, but yeah, I'm happy with that. Cash. Pretty indifferent about cash as a FPL pick. Maybe here. Not really super keen. Garner. Garner. Ghana. Ghana. Pretty reliable pick. Garner. He's like Anderson Light, isn't he? um losing some set piece share though now that Jbury Hall is back which has impacted him. So let's put Garner I guess a little lower than Anderson. I'm going to put him here. Garn Rice or Celiba Captain? Definitely Rice over Ciba. Definitely Rice over Ca. Should we do a captain poll? Just not no triple captain. So, let's um end that and we'll do Sorry, we'll add Meguire. Sorry, I know a few people are asking about Meguire. We'll add him in and I'm going to run up another poll whilst we add some a few more players to the bench list. So, Maguire um I guess above Tarovski, something like this. Maybe higher. Is that harsh? Maybe above Wilson. Yeah. Hey, Sheps is here. Member for 60 months. If I'm not mistaken, that's five years. Incredible. Incredible stuff. Uh, thank you, Callum. Nice to see you in here, my friend. Um, right, new super chat. It's£10 super chat. Thank you very much. Uh, Cmax Spud, sorry for so many questions. Start Keller or Vugan? Uh, Vugan. Um, which one to bench and Burma Munoz, Enzo Chaliba, JPL Rogers? I'm top 3K and got the triple captain on Rice. Would you do Gabriel instead? Any advice? Well, yeah, I would do the I would do R. Sorry, I would do Gabrielle instead. I am doing Gabrielle instead. I feel like Gabrielle has a higher ceiling. Um, so more potential for things to go very right, but also a higher floor as well. So just I think in every way um Gabrielle to me just seems a much better captain than Rice. Uh some people may disagree but we've spoken about that extensively uh throughout this week I guess. Um in terms of who to bench and Burma, Enzo Chalaba, Shah Pedro or Rogers. I guess I guess Chalaba is maybe the answer to that one. Um because I think Chelsea will probably concede to leads. So you're looking at a four-pointer from Chaloba, which is pretty decent still, but I think the other guys just have a higher ceiling. How how likely is O'Reilly to start? I think O'Reilly is first choice for Man City. I think that is to me pretty clear. But when you play for Man City, being first choice is not always the uh the entire uh set of conditions required to start games with Pep Roulette. Who do you think is on Pens if Yarez isn't on the pitch? It's not going to be Erdigard, is he? Because he's probably not going to play. Um Eza, maybe if he's on the pitch. Um man, that's hard. Um, okay. From recent memory of Arsenal penalty takers, it's been Saka, Yakarez, Erdigard. I'm trying to think prior to that, who have I seen take penalties? I think Eza could take one. He's taken them for Palace before. I think I think I have vague memories of Martineelli having taken a penalty for Arsenal. Um, Gabrielle Jesus has got to be in contention, I guess, if he's starting. I don't I can't see Havitz. See it? Uh did Tech Rice take a penalty. I don't know, man. I I just don't think I've ever seen Havs take a penalty for Arsenal. Gabriel and Pence would be nice, wouldn't it? Um I don't know. Let's Let's have a I'm going to have a look at um Hav's penalty record. Is that what you're angling for? You want Havs to be on penalties to give you extra justification to uh pick them up. Okay. So, uh Havz has taken penalties before, but never for Arsenal. Oh, wait. That's a lie. He's taken one penalty for Arsenal. Oh, of course he has. I remember this. This was when Havitz was kind of going through a bit of a goal drought. He hadn't been at Arsenal very long and they were trying to build up his confidence. They were already like 3-0 up. I believe Arsenal were like 3-0 up and Havs and Saka very graciously gave Sacka the penalty. That is the only penalty I remember Havs taken for Arsenal and it is by the looks of this record the only penalty Havs has ever taken for Arsenal. So yes, he has technically taken a penalty for Arsenal before, but the circumstances in which it happened do not lend itself to repeatability. Let's put it that way. So will he take penalties? Maybe. Maybe. He's taken them for Germany before. He's taken them for the odd one for Chelsea. He's taken a few when he was back when he was playing in Germany. Although that's like what, six, seven years ago now. Maybe maybe Habits takes a if everyone else is off the pitch, but it's uh how likely you'll be saying that is Ibrahim says own Timba uh and Omari Omari Hartinson. Uh so Timber and Omari to Sar sorry what's going on here? Own timber. Omari to Sar or heaven to Caiba or play Barry. Omari to Sar or heaven to Celiba. If you haven't tripled up on Arsenal yet, that's your priority. That's what you need to do first. So if going from Aiden he I'm presuming that's Aiden Heaven to Siba. If that is an option for you and your only way of getting a third Arsenal player, then I would absolutely do that. Z with a super chat here as well. Wilson to Vitz Enzo Rogers S or roll. I think I would roll. I know that's the boring answer. Um but honestly, I think that's what I would do because I think I quite like Wilson. The only exception to that is if you feel very strongly about Vertz, Rogers, or Saw. I would give Enzo a miss though, if I didn't already own him. I think the boat is close or the ship is close to sailing on that one. So, you haven't quite missed the boat, but yeah, you're getting closer. Ahmed says, \"Muno's in for Chiao. Already have Richards. I don't think I'd like to double up really. I'd prefer to go for a Bournemouth defender if you've already got Richards.\" Um, but you could you could still go for Minos. It's just I'm not super keen on the double up there. Uh and John Long says, \"Hello, mate. What about a goalkeeper for the next six gamew weeks? I'm a little sick of a burggainen.\" So trying to get him out and finally gain some points in the goalkeeper spot. Um six gameweek goalkeeper. I after this week I think Keller looks nice, but I'm guessing you're looking up until what? Uh game 32 wild card maybe. I think it would have to be Kellaha because the fixtures are good after this week. And you can always buy Kellaha or you know wait until next week to get Kellaha or if you do need to buy Kellaha this week, play to Bravka this week. Play your backup goalkeeper. So yeah, I guess Keller I guess Kella is the answer. It's just not a great It's just not a great jumping on point for Keller, is it? Shepsy, thank you very much for the 79 or $1 and zero cents as the case may be. Um, to let you know, Callum, uh, YouTube does not allow messages with super chats or super stickers as they're known below what is it like 1 pound50 or more. It is a YouTube thing. I did not implement that rule. So, I don't know if you intended to throw in some kind of message in there. Um, but that that is often the case. People will put in like less than the YouTube threshold for messages, hoping that the next box will give you the option to write a message. But there is no next box and clicking send just sends the money. But thank you though. We'll take it. We'll take it. You're most perfectly welcome, John Long. And thank you very much for the super chat indeed. And thank you everyone for the super chats today. They really do help out the channel, guys. You know, it makes up a big chunk of um my wage. Well, that failed heavily. Enjoy 1/8 of a point on me. Thank you very much, mate. I will. I truly will. You tried. But next time, you're going to have to you're going to have to pull pull out the big bucks. I'm going to have to see two quid on the table if you want to put in any messages in this stream or indeed any stream because that's just how it works. That's just how it works. All right. Um what we saying on bench list? Is there any players uh who you feel are missing? Any non-ifferial players? Because last time we had a problem. The over 60s were in the chat and they couldn't read the uh the bench list because I put too many names on there and it made the text too small. Have to wait for payday and then we'll send my profanity. Fair enough, mate. Um please don't say Oh, actually there might actually be an automatic filter so that you might you may end up failing again um if it filters out swear words and stuff. Uh but you're welcome to try it. Just please nothing that is likely to get my account banned. Let's just put it that way. Uh although I don't think that's very likely to happen because I've never made any offenses on this channel before. All right. Who is missing then? AI. There are a few people with a Jai. Yeah, I think he can go on. Hill is on there already. I'm not totally confident about putting um Calbertt Lewon on there just because I don't know his injury status. Uh Callum Sturgis with the super chat says Manne Richards and Laqua on the bench. Uh I've bench boosted. Well, good luck to you my friend. Really um holding out for that Burnley clean sheet there. Good luck. Good luck. Yeah, that's a lot of investment. I mean, I'm hoping for a for a nice Crystal Palace clean sheet as well against Burnley. Hopefully, it's uh hopefully it comes through. Um and good luck to you, my friend. And Jai, let's let's throw Jai in and then we'll get to that super chat from Luke. I would put Andai probably somewhere near here, right? Something like that. Okay, so Luke says, \"Can't get Rice. Would you uh would you would you recommend going for Esmart Martinelli?\" Definitely not Es Martinelli either because Trosard's available. Uh no, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend going for either of those players because I don't trust either of their minutes. I think you'd do just as well with a single gameweek player um compared to Eza and Marceli. So no, I wouldn't. I'd find another way. May maybe that means tripling up in defense. Maybe it means taking a hit. Um, yeah, I think you're just going to have to find a different way, Luke. I mean, some people like Zuba Mendy, not this guy. Yarez, maybe. Could you do Yarez as your third Arsenal? Way too chill says, \"Can't get Gabrielle, triple captain Rice, Ray, or Timber?\" I think if it if it was me, I I would maybe do Timber if I had to triple captain this week. But honestly, if I couldn't triple captain Gabrielle this week for whatever reason, I would just save the triple captainship for a future gameweek. I don't think there's anyone else from this Arsenal side that gives me enough confidence. And if you can't do Gabrielle, I think that would be really the um the tiebreaker because I don't think it's a super obvious decision to triple captain this week. I think there are multiple ways of doing things. Um, and anyone who's saving their triple captainship, absolutely fine. You know, it could work out even better. So, therefore, if you took Gabrielle away from me, that's what I do. I just saved the triple captainship. Uh, Ib sir says, \"XTK or Sha Pedro moving forwards. I wild carded on gamer 24.\" So, so it depends what you mean by that. If you're buying new, I probably wouldn't buy either this game week. I think Shah Pedro, the time to buy is probably past, but if you fancy a two gameweek punt and you need someone right now, then I'll go for Joel Pedro. Eat, I don't think I'd buy him ahead of Sunderland. I kind of be on the fence about buying him against Forest because it's an away fixture. But certainly from gameweek, so basically gameweek 26 27, Joel Pedro is better. Game 28 onwards. Echk is better is the simple answer to that. It depends. Do you need something right now? Can you wait? Dan, your triple vice captain is is is rice just for security? But I think technically I prefer timber just because I want I always try and make sure my vice captain is someone who is kind of ultra low risk um kind of player. Ultra low risk. And I think rice is that. I wonder if I can persuade my my dear wife um to get me a drink. Um hello pretty and you make me a squash. Um my poor chat um need me to stay here and answer their questions. There we go. Right, Rogers on the bench list. Are we thinking benching Rogers? We're not surely. Um, I mean, he would go to the top of this list to be fair, so I don't think uh I'll do that. Is Timber guaranteed to start both games? No, he's not guaranteed to start both games. No. I mean, there's every chance he does, but I would give it, you know, there's got to be at least a 10 to 20% chance that he misses one of the two games. You would you would imagine. Um yeah. Oh yes. He's making this squash. Amazing news. Is there Did anyone find out if there's a Keith Andrews press conference? Is that not happening today? Poor assho. Oh, make tea. Yes, please. Yes, please. Right. You know what? I think I'm ready to make my transfers. In fact, I'll wait till my squash arrives and Oh, no. Wait till my tea arrives as well. more cheers in the new the new transfers with a new drink. That's what we need. Will it be an orange or a black current squash? That's the question. Wifey guest appearance. We'll have to see. We'll have to see. I if if I know her, she probably will not want to come in because she's too shy. But we'll see. She's not been on the FBM YouTube channel in years now. Too long. Too long. Right. Is Uber Mendy a bad option? I think bad is probably the wrong word. It's just an uninspiring option and probably is going to get you four or five points. That's that's harsh. Uh you could probably expect six or seven points. Elderflower squash nailed on. If my wife walks in with an elderflower squash, well, I'm glad we did a fresh wash of towels this week. I'll put it that way because she's going to need a few of them and probably to rewash her hair because that elderflower squash would be all over her. Would you play O'Brien or Cash? Um, I would play I don't know. I guess I guess O'Brien. Honestly, I'm I've got the elderflower squash in my head now. is if she comes in with the elderflower squash. Get out of here with that utter woke nonsense. Who's on pens for Walls? Great question. I wish I knew. I I think there's a good chance it's going to be Tou, but uh honestly I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. just joined King Gusto bench list. I think you got to play Gusto. He's he's looking good for minutes, I think, tonight because uh James is still a little a little risky. You can't do that to Morgan. She's too sweet. I absolutely can do that to Morgan if she that that is that is that is not sweet behavior at all. That is wind up merchant behavior. She she would know I would hate that as well. So, if she wants to wind me up, oh, we two can play that game. Playful banter. Will Ju Hall ever make the bench list? Do we really have to put There's There's a lot of begging for Ju Hall on the bench list. I suppose he'll have to go on, won't he? I just don't really know where to put him. I guess like next to Andai. In fact, let's just put him here. Then we don't take up any extra space. You've never wanted something to happen more. Well, let's find out. Let's find out what happens next. Captain Gabriel or Yukarus? Definitely Gabrielle. Oh, I said I was going to do another poll. We're not long until deadline now. All right. So, uh, this is not a triple captain question. This is just a general captain question. Who is your game week 26 captain? And we're going to put Gabrielle Rice. Who else? Timber or other? I think that pretty much covers it. Is there anyone else I'm missing? There. Is anyone seriously Hello. Come in. I'm putting the poll in. Are you actually making appearance on the FBM YouTube channel? or you sneaking in the corner, not even using any words. That was one of the sneakiest sneaks. Thank you for that. Bye. See you soon. Well, I can tell you it's not elderflower. You want to take Should we take bets on what what flavor the squash is? Get your bets in. Right. Um, what we missing? Petravvic. Petravvic. I wouldn't mind playing Petravvic this week to be fair. Vimto. Vile. Vile. Um, Petraich probably probably here. I don't know. Right. Well, if anyone answered black currant, you are exactly correct. Summer fruit in February. in February. Vile. That's worse than elderflower. Elderflower vinto and summer fruit. Say fruit and barley. Next. Fruit and bar. You know what the worst one is? Lemon. Has anyone ever had lemon squash before? It's uh Ridiculous. That's good squash. That is a good That is a good Asda's own black currant squash. Max says, \"I love lemon squash, mate. Come on, man.\" Mark likes it as well. You guys need to all give your heads a collective wobble because that is vile. Summer fruits all year round. How can you If you're having one drink all year round, how can you possibly enjoy it? Lemon is elite. Get cultured down. No, I'm sorry. Am I Am I in the Twilight Zone? What's going on, man? What's going on? Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Um, right. Well, I'm going to make some transfers. Well, a transfer. So, I'm going to flick the bench list off the screen for a momentto. And we're going to do ciao to riches. We're going to lock this one in. Um, even if the Collins situation uh looks grim there, we have got some time. I mean, I don't I wouldn't even have to play him in 27 if I didn't want to. Um, I need to know basically by gameweek 28, is he good or is he bad? Because I would really like to play him from gameweek 28 onwards. Really like to play him. But for now, we don't need him. So, we've got our good friend Ricardo Shep. Even you like lemon squash. Oh man, I can't believe it. It's so bad, man. It's so bad. Honestly, I was like stranded in the middle of the Sahara Desert and all I had was lemon squash. I'd say, \"Mate, I'd rather wait till the next oasis. Even if there's a crocodile in there waiting for me, I'd rather take my chances with some proper proper swamp water rather than some chemically grown lemon swamp water. Terrible. Terrible. I'll take my chances. Um, right. So, I think I'm pretty much locked in now with 15 minutes to go till deadline. Triple captain's active. I mean, I'm if I had Timber, I'd probably vice captain him, but I don't. So, um, Gabri, uh, Gabrielle triple captain. I'm I'm so set on that at this point. Rice on the vice. Rice on the vice. It rhymes. It's just right, isn't it? Uh, pint of lemon squash or triple captain EAC this week. Oh, well, I'd have to take the squash, wouldn't I? I'd have to take the squash. Damn. That That would At least nobody ever put me in that situation. So gross. Like I've literally tried to drink it before and like I can't physically swallow it. It's so horrible. It's so horrible. Brenford Wool 100% score. 100%. Stick your mortgage on it then, mate. Stick your mortgage on it. You're that certain. Uh, should I transfer Keen to anyone? No. Here. Uh, yeah, potentially if you've got like a Hill Sessie, Richards, Mos shaped hole in your team, then maybe one of those guys could work. Uh, Benjamin with a super chat says, \"Donnaruma or Pigford in goal?\" I think Donnaruma's your guy. Any leaks? Um, any leaks? I doubt it. To be fair, to be fair though. To be fair though, what what leaks are you looking for? Reese James or Anthony Gordon? I think a good chance Anthony Gordon could be in the squad by the way today. Um, I don't know if that impacts anyone in any way. Papu says Premier League server is down. I can't change my team now. Um, have you tried the app? And if you tried the app, have you tried the desktop? Um, try a different device is basically is basically my advice. Uh or yeah or um uh if you are on mobile and you only have access to a mobile, if it's not working on the mobile app, try your browser, your inapp browser. That's what I would recommend. Uh haven't got any news other than this. This is interesting. Cash not pictured in training apparently. We will see what happens there. Um, yeah, that's all I got. That's all I got. Start Tatty or Rogers? I'd start Rogers. Would you play Wilson over cash? Yeah. Uh, Ipsster says, \"Dan, what do you think uh of triple captain Harland versus Fulham or Petro versus Burnley?\" Um, nah. I I'd really be looking at triple captaining on a double gameweek. If you don't do it on an Arsenal player this week, then really we're waiting to see if if gameweek 35, 36, or 37 become a double gameweek. Um, all of which have a chance to become double gameweeks. Technically, gameweek 31 does as well. Uh, no, game week 31. Is that right? Gameweek 32. So, technically gameweek 32 also has a chance to be a double gameweek. Um, but pretty unlikely. So, we may get another double is pretty likely that we'll get another double gameweek this season. Um, if you're not using a triple captain on this gameweek, then do it on another. I live to watch you press the panic button a minute before the deadline. Is there a panic button? There's no panic button. I'm chilling. Honestly, sometimes I am panicking. Today is not one of those days. Today I'm chilling. Team saved. Team looks good. Everything's in order. Gabrielle's triple captained. In fact, maybe I'll scroll up a little bit just to make it very clear that triple captain is active. Man's active. Can't see the bench, but who cares? We trust in him, Big Gabby. We do indeed, Benjamin. We do. Uh Henry says, \"Dan, don't triple captain Gabrielle trust me on this.\" I'm sorry, Henry. Um I don't believe we've met before, and it takes me a little while to build up trust with new people. So, uh for that reason, I'm I'm going to have to go ahead and not trust you this week. Um well, let's work on our rapport and we'll see. Mark says, \"Sorry, Dan, but I'm hoping for Enzo to fail.\" Fair enough, Mark. Fair enough. I mean, I'm hoping Enzo will do very well. I don't know if it'll happen or not. Finding out Bruno is benchwood. Uh, press the panic button. Are they They're not playing until uh later, are they? No, they're playing 45 minutes later. So, I think the chances of us getting a leak there is pretty low. We don't typically get Man United leaks. Actually, that's a lie. We do sometimes. But I don't know. The the game isn't until what, like 8:30? No, 8:15. So, pretty late. You know what? I'm looking forward to a footy extravaganza tonight, though. I'm I'm ready. I'm ready to go back in for more FPL after this weekend. A nice a second Green Arrow in a row. I'm I feel like I'm on a roll. I'm ready to go again. I just cannot wait for Gabrielle on Thursday. It's going to be so much fun, man. I love the triple. Triple captain is the most overrated, overhyped chip in the entirety of FPL. And realistically, the swing you're going to get from a decent triple captain is like 10 points on the crowd. I mean, um, but it's just so much fun. And I I think that's the purpose of FPL, right? To be fun, just to add that extra little bit of jeopardy. It feels like it's more Jeopardy than it actually is. And I don't know, it just it it does it for me. It does it for me. Chess said, \"It's my birthday. As a birthday gift, can you please reply whom to play? Bowen against Man United at home or Wilson against Man City?\" I play Bowen. But by the way, I think I'd play Bowen at least. There's not much in it. I think I play Bowen because he's on penalties. By the way, if it's not actually your birthday, chess, and this is kind of the new meta for getting people to reply in the chat, then honestly, fair play. I won't let it work on me again. So, I'm sorry anyone else who it's birthday who birthday it is today. Uh I will not be falling for it again. But, you know, for the creativity of using the birthday meta to get a chat reply, honestly, fair bloody play. Fair bloody play. You've even got people in the chat saying happy birthday. Here we go. Oh, look. It seems to be a few other people's birthdays in the chat. Hy funny how that works, isn't it? Funny how that works. Play Wilson or Chela. I'd play Chela. I'll put the bench list on screen. We'll put it on. We'll leave it on there for a couple more minutes. I have to play Wilson and Bowen. Not ideal. David, I think it could be worse. I think it could be worse, my friend. Jude says, \"Genuinely, it is my birthday.\" And then follows with an FBO question. If you if you just said, \"Genuinely, it's my birthday,\" I would have said, \"Happy birthday.\" But because you followed it up with an FBO question, I just have to be suspicious now. And I just feel like I don't know. I don't I don't Maybe I'm being made a fool of. So, I'm sorry, Jude. Can't do it. It's my birthday. Can you drink some lemon squash? No. David wants £10 because it's his birthday. I It's in the It's in the post in in your card, David. It'll arrive soon, I'm sure. Happy birthday to everyone in the chat. You know what? If it is your birthday today, if it you know what? Even if it isn't your birthday, happy birthday to everyone, regardless of if it's your birthday or not, because apparently it's arbitrary anyway. Who cares if it's your birthday? If it helps you get FBL questions answered, then um then it it could be. And who cares anyway? Just a random number. How many times the earth has revolved around the sun since the day you emerged from your mother, so who cares? Ryan says it's his wedding. You know what? Everyone wish me a happy birthday. Thank you guys. Thank you for everyone wishing me a happy birthday. It's everyone's birthday and yet nobody's um merry Christmas too. Why not? Happy Hanukkah. Happy Hanukkah. Uh and uh Eid Mabarak as well. Why not? Why not? Happy Pride Day. You know, happy Pride Day. Pride month. Is that Wait, it actually is Pride Month, isn't it? Okay. Happy not Pride month. I don't know. Happy Easter. Happy Pancake Day. Shrove Tuesday. It's my favorite day of the year. Oh, May Bank holiday. Wowers. Um, let's get back to FPL for the final five minutes before I lose my mind. Uh, it's because I've been streaming for too long. Uh, Momo Suzoko says, \"Hi, Dan. Two free transfers. Cash to Minos, Evan, to Evanson to Strand Larson, Anderson to Sar. Um, no, I don't think so. I wouldn't I don't think I'd bring in two Crystal Palace players. I just pick your poison. Uh, happy Black History Month. Happy uh Black History Month as well. That's the important one. That's the big one. Um I don't Yeah, I wouldn't do double crystal patch, but I think I could I certainly wouldn't do triple. If you had if you can afford to do cash to mono in one move, I would do it though. Evan Hilton to Strand Larsson and Anderson to Sar not really as keen on those moves. But cash to I I quite like if you can uh if you do that in one if not even even cash to to Richards is is pretty nice to me. He's pretty nice indeed. All right. Well, let's check. Let's keep an eye out for early team news. I'm hoping you guys are happy with bench list. If not, take a screenshot. It will last longer. And I will put my team on screen for the final few minutes of the stream just because the show team gang and not going to be happy otherwise. Going to be displeased at best. Let's take a screenshot of my FPL team as well before the uh deadline passes. 2 minutes till deadline, guys. Make sure we are locking in any final transfers, decisions, benchings, um triple captains. Is anyone still Is anyone here still on the fence for triple captain? Is anyone still not locked in? Marty O, I forgot how to say your surname. Om Mahoon Marty Mahoon says, \"Uh, here's some candy d'H.\" What on earth is candy dash? Is that Irish? Is that an Irish phrase? Here is some candy dash. Candy dash to be sure. Um, yeah, there are a few people in the chat. Oh, correct. It is an Irish uh term. Or yes, that's correct how I'm saying your name. Who knows? Who knows at this point? I need to write it down. Really, the pron pronunciation. Do'Sh. I know. I know. Do'Sh'ache is money. I've heard do'ach. Oh, it's sweets money. Oh, candy means sweets. Is that's like in America. Crazy. Weird. Um, okay. Well, some people some people locking in bench boost is crazy. It's dodged to my candy with gez. But I've never used the phrase candy. The only time I would ever use the word candy is if I'm singing 50 Cent songs, which doesn't happen very often. DCL or Rogers. Uh, Rogers. Kaisedo will score. Well, fair play. Shout out FPL crew. Dan, you make me laugh with the lemon squash bon anniversary. Thank you, Simon. And more. And yet still more people in the chat are still saying it's their birthday. Crazy candy floss. Oh yeah, sen backpacker. That's a good point. I would I would use the term candy if talking about candy floss. Uh right, literally 30 seconds till deadline, guys. So, um it is time to lock her in. Oh, that was a slurpy slurp. I need to go away from the This tea is not had a non I've not had a caffeinated cup of tea in a long time. At least two weeks. I was taking into consideration our American cousins. Oh, well that's your mistake. Right, guys? That is going to be locked. We're locked in. We're locked in, guys. The deadline has officially passed. Yes, indeed, guys. A midweek deadline. The first double gameweek of the season. We are ready to go. We are ready. I hope we're ready. At least I feel ready. And what's that? What's that I hear? Could it be? What could it be? Hello. Ah, okay. Okay. Right. I will pass the message on. I'll pass the message on. Sorry. It's It's Mikuel Artetta. Mikuel Artetta. Yes. Yes. MueL. Yes. Uhhuh. And we're still on for paddle on uh on Wednesday even though it's the day before the game. We're still on for paddle. We are fantastic, mate. Bring your own game. You're going to need it, my friend. All right. Adios, amigo. Bye-bye. Well, that was Mal Artetta ringing me to inform me that Gabrielle is is is going to haul this week. He's told me he's put he's put Gabrielle in charge of of of the of set pieces. Gabrielle is going to be on the end of every single one. None of this timber nonsense. None of this, you know, ball bounces out to for a second ball to Zuba Mendy or anything like that. We are going to be seeing a Gabrielle masterclass. Mikuel told me he he's told me it's happening. It's happening. So, uh yeah. Um I I would usually I'd say good luck to to Gabrielle, Triple Captain. You don't need it. You don't need it. Art has told me. He's told me. He's told me already. He's not going to put Gabrielle in the nine, though, which is disappointing. And he he he could not confirm nor deny whether Gabrielle would be on penalties either. Um but maybe he's teasing it. Maybe he's teasing it. Are we seeing a squash tier list? Well, considering I only drink two types of squash, orange or black currant, and I pretty much refuse to drink all others in uh my uh in a little stuck in my ways when it comes to squash. Uh I don't think there's much point. I would just put black currant and or black currant and orange in S tier. I'd put fruit and barley, summer fruits, apple and black currant in No, not apple and black currents elite actually. Um I'll put those in like D tier and then F tier would be like lemon and strawberry squash. Oh my word. I have had strawberry squash before. Vile. Absolutely vile. Orange and pineapple is like a sea tier. Why mess about with it? Shepsy says, \"Dan, it's my nan uh Eene Dover's birthday. She's 67 today. Could you give her a shout out?\" Well, Shepsy Shepsy Shepsy, let's figure this out for a second. You're 32 years old. So if your nan was 67, that means you you both your nan and your mom would have been teenagers when they had one another. And you I don't know if uh if that works mathematically um but in case in case it does uh happy birthday to Shepsy's nan do 67 today. Happy birthday. Um right. What else we got here? Thanks for the great channel, Dan. Sometimes I do wonder if it is a great channel. Sometimes I do wonder. Um, Los Hobbits says, \"Thanks, Dan. Have a great week and good luck with the trouble captain. Going to watch some anime now like real men do.\" What anime, Lost Hobbits, I need you to answer me that before you go. Uh, something backpacker says, \"So, basically the next charity stream, guess what the crowd want you to drink a pine of?\" Hey, look. If it's for charity, then this is different. This is different. There are a few things I would not do for charity. That's like there are so many things I wouldn't do for charity. I mean, look, I try and be a a nice guy, a generous guy where I can, but everyone has their limits. Uh, everyone has their limits. I watch you and FPL Tom, but all FL guys are cool. I I hopefully agree. Hopefully agree. I do still want to at some point try and attempt the longest ever FPL stream for charity. So maybe maybe that can be the one where we set various challenges such as drink flavors of squash that are quite frankly vile. Um, and maybe we could do we can set up a a series of oh what we could do we could do like a spinny wheel and every time we hit a ch like a charity money target we spin the wheel of forfeits and one of the forfeits can be like wear a Spurs football shirt for the next hour. One could be um like drink a pint of lemon squash just other vile things that I definitely don't want to do. We could do something like that. That could be fun. We could do something like that. We're talking about bird legs again, man. Uh, what else? We can do a watch along. I don't think I'll do a watch along. I think I'll just do like a like a dayong deadline stream. Like an ultra long deadline stream. Or unless you do unless you'd rather do like a watch along for like a a full days worth of football. Maybe Mark has sent a gifted membership into the chat, but who will be the one to receive it? It's Cravac. Congratulations, Cravac. And thank you very much to Mark for gifting a membership. Absolute legend. Sravac, make sure you say thank you. Uh, what else we got here? Uh, FC26 watch along. Does anyone really want to watch him play FC 26? I you know what? I don't even I don't even play Ultimate Team and I haven't done since like October. Honestly, I did not last long on Ultimate Team this year at all. In fact, I've got I've got a load of FC points just sitting on my account unused because I was like, I'm not enjoying this game enough to justify spending these FC points that I have already bought. So, I'm saving them. So, I'm just saving them for next year. What about lemon sorbet? Can't say I've ever had it. Maybe the start of next season you can do a full day stream up till deadline. The only problem with that is is I'm usually like crazy busy in the runup to the first deadline with a million different things. Um, plus like events and stuff as well. If I'm going to like FPL related events, which I often am at the start of the season, meetups and stuff, which I haven't been to an FPL meetup since since gameweek one deadline day. I need to go to another one, but I just don't know. I don't know when the dates are. I will go to I will go to some more FPL meetups soon. And if there's any around the country, I might may even go somewhere slightly different. Right. Uh, and we can get a selection of ideas for the wheel of uh, misfortune. Yeah, we we'll do some we'll do some uh, brainstorming. We'll do some brainstorming for that. I need to figure out when the stream is going to be first of all and what we'll do, whether it'll be like a really long deadline stream or like a watch. Dan, why did you leave Richardes in your starting 11? What do you mean? Why did I leave him there? It's where he's meant to be. He's right exactly where he's supposed to be in life. Congratulations to the young man. Um, yeah, Burnley at home. No brain. All right. Uh, Muhammad says, \"Are you a full-time YouTuber now?\" Yes, and I have been for what is it coming up? Five years. That doesn't seem right. How long have I been married? I actually need to work this out. When did I quit my job? I quit my day job in like June of or July July 2021 which means I will be I will have been five years as a full-time YouTuber as of July. Wow. How on earth am I going to reintegrate with the regular world after that? How on earth am I going to reintegrate into normal society? You guys are just going to have to keep watching my videos, I'm afraid. I am not going back to the offices. I'll tell you that right now. I'll make videos for nobody before I do that. And unfortunately, I'll have to become a burden on my family who will have to fund my lifestyle. Uh uh what we got here? Oh my god, mate. I'm so scared. Are we going to do well? Yeah, of course we are. Been watching you since the 201920 season. Gosh, time flies. That is a long time to be fair. A very long time. Uh, are you going to do lineups? Yes. Yeah, I'm waiting another four minutes for the lineups and we're going to go through them and have a little look. What was your full uh full uh wait, sorry, trying to read this again. What was your profession before doing this full-time? I was a really I don't know how to describe it because I did I had so many I worked for a small company and basically did a little bit of everything. Bit of admin, bit of web administration, bit of design, bit of customer service. bit of like um but like the the relevant stuff I guess was the um the user interface uh UI and UX design which I was doing and I guess just design work in general. I mean I've done design stuff at least freelance for 10 years. Um, so yeah, yeah, graphic design I've been doing free, well, not the last five years I haven't been because I've been doing YouTube, but but saying that, even when I first started the YouTube channel, I was doing a lot of freelance uh graphic design for bits and bobs. I did a lot for Fantasy Football Hub. Um, a lot of the stuff they still use the in in terms of the FPL community, the thing that I that as a designer rather than as a YouTuber that I pioneered as an FBL behind thes scenes designer is, you know, when you you watch podcasts and underneath, you know, FBL podcasts, right? I don't know if any of you guys watch any of them, but there's loads of them out there. And sometimes they will have like their name underneath them. So that their name would be like down here and it would say their rank and then a an arrow, a green or a red arrow going up or down. I was the first first person to add that in to any uh podcast, any uh any FPL podcast. I was the first person to add that that little arrow. Um, fun fact for you now. Everyone does it. Pioneer, my friends. Pioneer. Tiny little detail, but you everyone does it now. Everyone does it. But like to be fair, when I first started doing FPL stuff, the the the space was fairly barren. Like, you know, there wasn't a lot of people doing it, and those that were doing it weren't doing much. So, But yeah, the bench list 100 experts. Yeah, they're things that I started and then everyone a lot of people doing um bice void tier lists. Um generally speaking, whole bunch of stuff, but I think that's just because I've been around for so long at this point. I'm I'm I'm basically an old fogy when it comes to FPL content at this time, which is crazy to say. It's pretty crazy to say. We'll try and find some uh some uh lineups and stuff. We go to Let's go to Chelsea first. Chillshoot. Chillshoot. Chelsea. Clearly influenced the FPL community in many ways. I think I have. I think I have. I hope I have. I hope I've been a nice, you know, I hope my uh I have a a legacy that lives on when I'm done in the FPL community, which hopefully is not for a very very long time. If it does have to come to the end, hopefully I may I left a good mark that continues onwards and uh inspires the next generation of FPL content creators. That would be a nice way to end if it had to. But there we go. Thank you very much for the kind messages, guys. Computer stuff, basically. Yeah, that was my old job was computer stuff. He's the He's He does the computer stuff. That Dan works for us, does computer stuff, but I work for a company where everyone did computer stuff. So, so there you go. Right. Come on, Chelsea. Chelsea, FPL, Dan, you should be proud of yourself. what you're achieving is amazing. Thank you very much. I do appreciate. I really do. Still get imposter syndrome uh quite often, particularly Oh, I think F are tweeting the uh tweet stuff out. Are they tweeting stuff out? Maybe. Uh yeah, particularly with the last couple of seasons where my ranks have not been ideal, but um things can change fast. Please be here. Okay, Hill's here. Hill's here. Sessi's here. Ryan's here. Who's not here? Crooppy Junior on the bench. Okay, we have our first uh catastrophe uh of the gameweek 26 midweek gameweek. There's always bound to be a catastrophe or two. Fingers crossed not too many of you guys started Krooppy Jr., but he is on the bench. That's catastrophe number one. I will read out the Bournemouth starting lineup. We've got Petravic, Trafair, Sness, Scott, Evan Olson's, Christy, Jimenez, Adley, Hill, Tooff, and Ryan. Uh, I've got Newcastle next and Gordy Gordon's back. Pope, Trippia, Botman, Gordon, Barnes, Cow, Elanga, Willick, Burn, Bruno G, and Ramsey, which means Hall is on the bench. Does anyone have Hall? Maybe another disaster. Mark says, \"I should have waited till a bit uh waited a bit before gifting. Save for the people who stay to the end.\" Yeah, maybe Mark. Maybe Mark. It doesn't matter. Maybe I'll gift. Can I gift? How do I gift? How to gift? Uh. I don't even know. I don't know how to gift. I'll figure out for next time and I'll I'll uh I'll gift. We'll do one each. Right. Anyway, yeah, looks like Anthony Gordon and the number nine again because there's no Whistler or Voltermard H. Um yeah, so there you go. Uh but yeah, Hall is the uh disaster catastrophe from Newcastle. Also, Croo Junior and Hall the most significant absentee so far. Next, we've got Everton and I've already seen a disaster. I'll read out the team. It's Pikford O'Brien, Topsy, Branwait, Micheleno, Ghana, Ghana. Two Garners, Adrisa, Ghana, Gay, and uh the other Ghana and Jai, Jhal, George. George is in and Barry and the there's one from every team. It's Keen. Keen is not in the Everton starting lineup. We did kind of know that Keen was circling the drain for that benching with Branweight and Michelenko available. So, um perhaps a little unfortunate but not entirely unexpected. Sean down with the super chat says, \"Fuming was at work and forgot to triple captain.\" Oh, man. Look, could be a blessing in disguise. Last week, someone sent me a message telling me that they accidentally left their captain's armbands on Palmer because they were at work or something. And what ended up happening was Arma scored 20 points and they wanted to move it to Bruno. So they're 10 points up because they made a mistake. It can happen Sean and it could happen to you. You never know. All right. Uh leads up next. We got Darlow, Bogle, Goodmanson, Roodon, Bhol, Borau, Justin, Aidu, Gruv, Aronson, and Meta. So, oh that guy earlier who said that there was a trusted leak of no Calbertt Leuen, they were spot on. We have our fourth um disaster I suppose for gameweek 26. One from each team. This leads one is Calbert Leuen, but like I guess um at least he's not in the squad, so you're going to get an auto sub there. So, not the worst. Queen of the Stone A says, \"Hello, Daniel. Triple captain breakdown on your videos was really helpful.\" So, thank you. I decided not to use the triple captain in the end. Very glad to hear it, my friend. I'm very glad to hear it. The the whole purpose of that was not to convince anyone to or to not triple captain, but just to uh help people understand their options so they can make their own decisions. I always trust people to make their own decisions. And any disasters here? Well, maybe. Maybe. Sanchez, Gusto, Ain Pong, Chalaba, Cukare, Kaisedo, Santos, Palmer, Enzo. Enzo in the 10 again. Estaval, Ja, Pedro, and on the bench. Do people still have Netto? Do people have I don't know who else is missing? Reese, James, not even in the squad. If anyone has uh Netto or James, then that's bad news there. Everything else looks reasonably good. Um, but I I wouldn't call that a disaster. These are real real fringe players. Not really too many FPL managers have these guys. So, we got our first team that really doesn't have any major absentees. Huzzah. Huzzah. And finally, actually, what we got? Shepsi says, \"Think it'll be Enzo left wing again and Steve right wing Palmer 10.\" Oh, yeah. It kind of was like that, wasn't it? Yeah, that makes sense. Interesting. But like I guess it's just like your attacking versus your defense shape which is probably going to be pretty different. So in attack Enzo drifts to the left. Palmer stays central. Estaval is not going to play on the left, is he? I've not seen him play. Estal can't play on the left, can he? I've never seen it happen. thoughts, opinions, and from uh Tottenham, Top Spur. From Top Spur, we have Vicario, Dragassin, Chavy, Bassuma, Grace, Salangi, Gallagher, Spence, Obear, Saw, and Vanderven, the captain. Vanderven is in. Um, who's missing? Romero we knew was missing. Helen, tell. No one has these guys. They're They're banging out the youth players again on the bench. Uh yeah, it won't be rigid. They'll change about. Steve is significantly worse than the left now. Fair enough. Cool. All right. Well, I'll uh I'll take your I'll definitely take your opinion on that one. Um yeah, Enzo on the left then. Calling Estabio Steve is mad. Yeah, I mean that's a fair fair comment. I quite like Steve. It's It's far more pedestrian, isn't it? What was it that they called as Pilqua? Was it Dave at Chelsea? Sometimes, you know, they like to they like to anglify the uh the names over at Chelsea FC. Uh but anyway, guys, so and yeah, no real disasters from Spurs or Chelsea. Major pieces of news is Calbert Leuen not in the squad. Keen on the bench. Uh Hall on the bench. Creepy Junior on the bench. I think most people will probably will have dodged all of those. I think I've dodged all of them. Um so yeah, I think it could be worse. I think that could be worse, couldn't it? It could be worse. Right guys, I think we can pretty much wrap things up. I'm not really feeling like sticking around uh for half an hour to see Manchester United naming an identical squad for the fourth consecutive week. Um Talking Drum says, \"Please advise me on Semeno. I own him, but not sure what to do. You could keep him for now.\" Um I don't see a reason to rush him out. Um JP starts just wish Palmer didn't. Yeah, maybe Palmer get another early bath, early sub. seems to be the trend. Um, yes guys, um, good luck this game week, particularly my fellow triple captains of the Gabrielle variety. Wishing you all the best of luck. Enjoy the midweek game week. Have fun. Enjoy and watch the footy. Chill out. I know I'll be chilling out for a few days. I'm not really going to kick back up with the videos again for a few days now because I really really I don't know. I want to wait for the FA Cup games this weekend really. So, I might take a couple of days off. Let's play some video games, watch some anime, and chill. It's quite nice. Valentine's Day this week as well. Not that I celebrate it, but um maybe I should. But yeah, guys, cheers. Um thank you for all the super chats and support and new members and everything like that. You guys are legends. Um as always, I'll catch you whenever I'm back making content, which will be probably in a few days now. Going to take a couple of days off to watch the football. Um so yeah, cheers guys. Enjoy and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye. Oh, oh, oh. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right. Oh. Heat. Heat."

      "transcript": "I asked 100 FBL experts for their gameweek 26 transfer plans, captains, and chip strategies so you guys can follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Hello and welcome to FPL Mate. [music] My name is Dan and welcome to the first double gameweek of the season. I can't believe it is finally here. I'm sure uh we're all very excited about this one. it could go crazy. And as such, we are going to be talking a lot about those uh those captains, those triple captains. We got some interesting stuff today, guys. Um so, we're going to be finding out about triple captains, how many of our experts will be playing them this week. We'll also be looking at who those triple captains and and indeed regular captains will be played on. And it's actually really interesting the uh kind of data we have for captains in particular. But we've got all kinds of stuff. We got transfers as well today, guys. So, stick around. Uh massive thank you to the 100 experts who have dedicated their uh their time to giving us their data again this week for 26. Right. Well, I think this is probably the best place to start. Transfers and chips. How many transfers are being made this week? And actually, this is a week where maybe you could consider rolling your transfer, making no transfer whatsoever because around half of our experts will be doing just that. But the majority will be making transfers, but only just. So 41% of our experts will be making one transfer in Game Route 26. 8% will be making two transfers and 2% will be making three or more transfers with one of our experts actually making four transfers this week. Nobody's using a wild card or free hit this week, but we do have some chips being played. 2% of our experts are using the bench boost. So I wouldn't really call that a trend necessarily, but maybe if your bench does look truly truly extraordinary, then maybe that's an argument to play the bench boost. But it's the triple captain that I'm sure we're really interested in here. And without a doubt, 38% of experts using their triple captain in this gameweek is a trend. That is a very strong trend. But it's not conclusive. 38% using a triple captain means that 62% of experts will not be using the triple captain. So technically um most experts are not using a triple captain chip this week. But at 38% that is a very very strong argument. and and that is a very high number indeed. So even though it's not maybe it's maybe not a case where you have to use your triple captainship this week, it is definitely a case where this is a very very strong option indeed. And actually, even at 38%, we may not see a higher number than that between now and the end of the season. Because if the triple captainship is maybe split between a couple of other gameweeks throughout the remainder of the season, 38% in one game week may actually end up being the highest percentage of experts using their triple captainship in one week that we will see for the remainder of the season. So, just wanted to put that one out there. Just because the majority of experts are not using the triple captain chip this week, that doesn't mean that this is automatically not the best week to use the triple captain chip if if that kind of makes sense to you guys. So huge number. I think if you are on or thinking about the triple captain chip, I think that is a large enough percentage of experts to maybe convince you to go for it. But if you are kind of maybe feeling a little cooler on the triple captainship, and by the way guys, if you haven't checked out yesterday's video, my team selection video, we talked about the triple captainship for like 15 minutes. That was like half the video was just triple captain talk. So go check that out if you just want more information about what the other options might be. But yeah, I think really this is maybe not as convincing as maybe a lot of you guys were hoping for. Maybe you maybe wanted to see a 50% plus here. Unfortunately, you're not going to see that. But the trends are significant, guys. And I and I think, you know, that is certainly, you know, it's given me some confidence to pull the trigger. I don't know about you guys, but it's giving me some confidence. It's it's enough for me. Um, but you guys will have to make your own judgment whether it's enough for you to convince you. Let's check out the transfer trends from the overall player base before we go to the expert transfers and and indeed who will be triple captain. And uh yeah, it's one of those weeks where actually the overall player base is not aligned with the experts in terms of the transfer ideas that they have. Really, we are seeing very very uh little correlation between what most FPL managers seem to be doing and what the experts seem to be doing. And in fact, the only player in the top 10 uh most popular transfers in the overall player base that our experts also are strongly transferring in this week is going to be Yurian Timber. Outside of that, there are some transfers in for Declan Rice. There are a couple of transfers in for David Ryer. But outside of that, Jockarez, Bruno, Zuba Mendes, Joel Pedro, and Burmo Palmer Gabrielle. There are no transfers in for any of those. And there are different reasons for that. First of all, players like Bruno Fernandez and Gabrielle in particular. These are two players that are owned by near enough all experts at this point anyway. So yeah, if they weren't, then I'm sure we would see more transfers for them. But outside of that, there's some players who maybe have a little bit of ownership among experts. You know, Burmo is like at 35 40% ownership among experts. Joel Pedro is maybe at 15% ownership. Palmer's maybe at some like 8% ownership among experts. So, still nobody looking to transfer these players in, but at least, you know, some a lot a lot of experts or at least a decent amount of experts have these players already. And then there's other players such as Jockz and Zubendi who make up two of the top three most popular transfers. uh in the overall player base and not only do our experts barely own these players, nobody has Zubendy, I think maybe one or two have Yokarez in their team, but nobody is looking to bring these guys in either. So, we are seeing a a major split here. Yokarez, Zub Mendy, overall player base love these guys. Experts clearly don't like these guys as FPL picks and and really do fancy some of the other Arsenal picks and rate the other Arsenal picks much higher than Yokarez and Zuma Mendy. And there's been a lot of questions this week about Zub Mendy in in my comments. Strangely large amount really. Um, as an Arsenal fan, I I'm not convinced at all by Zub Mendy as an FPL pick. He has scored in the last couple of games, but buying him expecting him to score like these worldy banger goals every single game week. It's just not realistic for him to keep scoring these goals. Ultimately, he is a defensive midfielder. usually he just takes the role of a defensive midfielder and you know doesn't actually get defensive contributions that often considering his deep position. So in general I don't really like Super Mendy as an as an FPL pick. Um particularly because going for him also sacrifices another Arsenal player who could be much much stronger. So that is my opinion on Zub Mendy. I know this video is not usually meant to be about my opinions but because there has been so many Zub Mendy questions I thought this would probably be the best time to answer them. Now, um we are going to be talking about some Arsenal differentials when we come to the um the bonus questions in the video. So, stay tuned for that. We will be talking a little bit more about some of these guys. But, uh yeah, uh for now, let's just stick with what the experts are actually doing this week. So, what the experts are actually doing is uh is selling Dorgu. Yes. Uh so, here are the transfers out, guys. We have seen in recent game weeks that experts have kind of been holding on to Dorgu quite a lot and just leaving him on the bench, but the transfers out for him are picking up. And I think a big part of that is the fact that uh there are more defenders that are looking like good options now. And certainly in the last few game weeks, there's not really been a good jumping on point for a lot of the defenders that we've been looking at. Now we're kind of coming into a place where teams particularly like Crystal Palace and Bournemouth maybe have really nice fixtures and you can just pick some nice cheap or expensive defenders from those teams. So now is a good time to make defender transfers because their options have have certainly grown. Uh there's more options to go for right now that look more convincing than maybe they may have a couple of weeks ago for example. So Dorgu is being sold six transfers out for him. Chiao is being sold six transfers out for him. Um among other defenders we see O'Reilly, Tarovski, Hall there as well. There also some midfielders being transferred out here. Enzo Lefay, three transfers out for him. Lewis Miley, a bit of an injury there. Few transfers out for him. Garner and Jai and Enzo just a couple of transfers out for for Enzo. Majority of experts will be keeping him, but he is another player mentioned in the bonus questions today. In general, I have to be honest with you guys, the transfer out trends in particular this game week, they're not particularly trendy. there. The trends are pretty weak. And actually, even though you see 10 players on this list, there were another maybe five players being transferred in out by maybe two experts each and and then another 20 25 players being transferred out by one expert each. So really what I saw in the data this week was a real spread of loads of different players, often differential players that are being transferred out this week, lowowned players. So, I think this is maybe one of those weeks where you remove maybe some of those players who you're not totally convinced by. Maybe you have them in your team and you don't really see them in many other people's teams. Those are the kind of players that look like the the kind of primary candidates for transfers out this week. Just those random players that you just have in your team. You've had them in your team for a while. You're just waiting for an opportunity to get rid of them. Now is maybe the chance to do exactly that. So, those are your kind of transfers out kind of trends, I guess. And the trend is that there isn't much trend. Just remove players that you're not happy with. It's is the simple answer. I know. If only FPL was that easy every single game week, right guys? But hopefully these videos are making FPL easier. And if they are, make sure you do drop a like. It really is appreciated. And do subscribe if you're new around here as well to follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Right, transfers in, guys. And we have some trendier trends. Yes, we've got a little bit more information here. And I think we can gather a little bit more from this one. So, first of all, Daniel Manoz, great first name, by the way. We do like a Daniel. Um, yeah, 5.8 million defender. A little expensive, but plays Burnley and Wolves in the next two. Really, really nice fixtures indeed. 13 of our experts will be taking the risk, the punt on the high upside Crystal Palace defender. So, he was barely owned by anyone last game week. So, we're seeing some real nice interest in him. And that is a a fairly decent number and a fairly decent trend particularly for a player who is is ultimately differential. He is a player that nobody really had last game week. And we're seeing similar numbers for Isa 11 transfers in for the Crystal Palace midfielder. He's just 6.3 million by the way guys. We expect him to be on penalties probably but not definitely. And um yeah just looks like a really really nice pick given the fixtures and given the form as well. You know scoring in in backto-back games now for Crystal Palace. really nice indeed for that kind of price tag. Outside of that, we're maybe looking at some more Arsenal players. If you haven't got your Timber in your team yet, you need to get that third Arsenal player, then what are you waiting for? The double game week is right now, so make sure you got that Arsenal triple up and Timber is the most transferred in of those Arsenal players this game week with players like Gabrielle and Rice already incredibly heavily owned. So maybe Timberidge maybe that third guy for a lot of experts. Um, the James Hill gang grows. Five new transfers in for James Hill. He's going to be up to 17% ownership among experts. The 3.9 million cheat code. Yeah, I'm so glad people are finally coming around to James Hill. We're going to see his ownership grow with each week. I think Declan Rice, four new transfers in for him to add to his 73 existing owners. Four new transfers in for Richards. Three new transfers in for Mané. And just a couple of transfers in for players such as Rya Anderson and Joel Gomez who is a little bit of a differential defcon kind of midfielder who plays for Wolves. Maybe some experts looking to get a nice eight-pointer from him in gameweek 26. So those are your transfers in but there is more to talk about today. For example, the template which technically hasn't changed this game week. So um no change in the goalkeepers really a small increase for Rehea in terms of the defenders. Gabrielle still flying high here. Timber up a 7% there up to 63% ownership. So yeah, he is a heavily owned player among experts. And it and it kind of looks like looking through these numbers that our experts will typically own Gabrio and Rice and then one of Rya and Timber. I mean that it's not strictly like that necessarily, but that's what the majority of experts are kind of running as their kind of Arsenal triple up right now, which is why we are seeing four Arsenal players in in the template as the kind of most popular players um that uh that you can kind of get. But certainly Rya are the least popular of those four. I guess the template for I suppose you could call them. Um outside of that, um small decrease for Chalaban, but not really much else change in defense. Um the only changes in midfield were was a little bit of increased ownership for Rice and Burmo and a little bit of a decrease for Enzo. And in the forward position, not much increase or decrease really here either. Small change for Echitique, but that's just about it. So the template has not really changed. A lot of the players that are being brought in are kind of differential players um to to be totally honest with you guys who aren't necessarily going to go straight into the template and we might have to wait another week or two before seeing them in these kind of uh these kind of pages. But anyway guys, no real change on the template. So yeah, hopefully that's all cool with you guys. Average Gameweek 25 score is 70.1 points. Let me know if you beat that score or not. Pretty decent score for the experts. Again, another big green arrow. And the average rank is up to 333,000th in the world. 82% of our experts are in the top 1 million, 22% in the top 100K, and 2% in the top 10K. Although given that it is chip season now, and there the fact that the experts are so unaligned with the overall player base transfers this week, I think that this could maybe get even better by the time we come to next week's video. To be honest with you guys, suggested transfers. If you haven't already got Yuri Timber or your I guess your third Arsenal player, then that's your priority move. So if you got someone like Chiao, got someone like O'Reilly, just any defender where you can afford to make the upgrade to Timber and you haven't done so already, just do it. If not, Daniel Munoz if you've already got your Arsenal player, Daniel Moz if you can go expensive or someone like Hill if you need to go a little bit cheaper at 3.9 million. If you've got a midfielder who you don't really like right now, the first player to get is Declan Rice, that third Arsenal player if you haven't done it already. And if not, you're going to be looking at SR. You're going to be looking at uh, you know, selling someone for Sara. I guess there's not really any other midfielders that are sticking out as transfers in this game. Don't think any of these players are really worth a hit necessarily other than maybe the Arsenal guys because getting your Arsenal sorted really is super important as we're going to find out when we come to the captains next where all of the captains this week come from Arsenal. And I say all of the captains, I mean both of the captains. And I think this is uh this is so useful for so many of the comments that I've been getting on on YouTube videos and on Tik Tok and on Instagram. So many people kind of questioning is Gabrielle really the best captain to go for? Like surely there are better options. Should I go for Rice? Can I go for Zendi? Should I go for Yarez? Well, let me tell you 100% of Gabrielle owners among experts will be captaining him this week. 97 captained, 97 owned, 100% captain hit rate. So, I I I don't really know how to kind of justify this anymore. We've spoken a lot about Gabrielle in uh in some of the other videos this week about how important he is, particularly in yesterday's video when we were talking about the triple captain and the triple captain on Gabrielle. Um so, go check that out if you want the full lowdown. But if you just want to take the expert's word for it, then it's very conclusive. It really is to to see that all Gabrielle owners are captaining him is nothing short of remarkable in terms of uh in terms of trying to get you know a definitive answer because that's what these these videos are really for. Is there expert consensus on anything? Do our experts prefer certain things? There is a complete consensus on this. So no doubt about it. And the only people who are not going to be captaining Gabrielle this week among those top managers really are going to be people who don't have Gabrielle. And in that case, maybe they go for Declan Rice. So 97 captains on Gabrielle, which is one of the highest numbers we have seen in the history of the 100 expert series, which has been running for four years now, and 3% just three going for Declan Rice. I don't even know if we've ever had a situation where 100% of owners are captaining one player, particularly not at these kind of numbers at least. So yeah, very conclusive. If you have Gabrielle, captain him. Um if you don't then Declan Rice is your probably your best second best option. I I don't know I guess. Um in terms of those triple captains, well uh obviously we have 38 triple captainers this gameweek. And I can tell you that all but one of them will be triple captaining Gabrielle. So that's 37 triple captains on Gabrielle and one triple captain on Deckham Rice. And again, I believe that is because that person doesn't own Gabrielle and and they're still looking to triple cap him in gameweek 26 and don't feel it's worth making switches around for, you know, an existing triple up on Arsenal to get Gabrielle in their team. So yeah, um I think this is really really useful for anyone who has kind of been on the fence or kind of secondguessing or doubting some decision- making. You can't do much better than this in terms of looking for um kind of validation on a certain move. And uh yeah, what can I say guys? Gabriel captain at the very least is the way and triple captain is also very much on the cards if you fancy going that way. With that said guys, we have got some bonus questions uh to kind of answer some of the things you have been asking this week. So bonus questions. The first question I asked our experts in the private uh Discord server was, is Enzo Palmer worth the upgrade? A few of you guys have been asking that this week. Uh 77% of our experts say no, it's not worth the upgrade. Just save your transfer. Save it for a rainy day, use it uh for something else this week, whatever. And 23% say yes, it is worth it, but only as a free move, for free transfer. So if you have money on the bank in the bank already and you can make a simple upgrade from Enzo to Palmer, then 23% of experts say do that, but most say don't. uh in terms of using a minus four to move Enzo to Palmer or indeed getting Palmer at all really. Um nobody's nobody is suggesting taking hits to to get Palmer into their team. So yeah, that would be the expert advice on that particular question with regards to Palmer who is of course so very popular this week among I guess non-experts. I suppose the other question was now I don't know if you guys watched last week's episode of the 100 experts but I basically asked which of these uh kind of arsenal differentials would you consider going for but I also included none as an answer and 80% of our experts said none. So, uh, what I thought I'd do this week is I would force my experts to pick an Arsenal differential because I know a lot of you guys you you've seen the template for Rya, Gabrielle, Timber, Rice, and you're still saying, \"I don't care if they're template. I don't care if they're popular. I don't care if the experts like them. I want something a little bit spicy in my team.\" And you know what? Totally fair enough. Um, if you're having more fun going differential and you know there are plenty of times where I've had a great time in FPL going differential, then you should absolutely do it and you should back yourself and you should go with uh what you feel most strongly about rather than you know necessarily just going boring all the time. I totally get it. So I forced the experts to pick a differential for you guys out of the following options. Yarez, Zubendy, Celiba, Havits, Califuri, Madaw Trosard, Gabrielle Jesus and Martinelli. you were forced to answer experts and 39% said Jockz is the best of these Arsenal differentials to go for and indeed he is the most popular in the overall player base as well. So if you are fancying going a little bit different Yokarez would be your guy. Celiba is in second place here 28% so you know maybe going for that triple up in the Arsenal defense potentially there could be really really interesting. Um and maybe Celiba is going to be part of that triple up. If so amazing. Um 11% said Zubame Mendy, 11% said Madawekke. So despite the the the high popularity of Zub Mendi, I could only convince 11% of experts to say that they would go for him and only if they were forced to. So uh yeah, that tells you all you need to know there. 6% would say Hav 6% said Trosard. Nobody said Califury, Trosard, or Martinelli. All considered too high risk for this gameweek. So there we go guys. If you do desperately want to go for a differential, go for Yokarez. Maybe go for Celiba. But I cannot stress enough, the true expert advice is to go for none of these guys and to stick with three out of Rya, uh, Gabrielle, Timber, and Rice. Three out of those four. That is what the experts are truly saying. So, there we go. But still interesting stuff and we make these videos to hopefully be a little bit interesting. Let me know if there are any other final questions before the deadline today, guys. Do drop a like. Do subscribe if you like this video as well. We'll be back for a deadline stream this afternoon. A couple of hours before deadline, we will be live on this YouTube channel answering more of your questions. So, make sure you join me there. Looking forward to seeing a few of you guys there. And I will [music] see you later, mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "Gameweek 26 is here and whilst we look at a potential triple captain this week, we also need to make some transfers as well. So, there are so many big decisions to be made this week as we lock in for FPL gameweek 26. Welcome to FPL, mate. My name is Dan, guys. A nice green arrow for me in game me 25. I would call it maybe a cheeky little green arrow because nothing enormous here, but we are edging ever closer to the uh the fabled top 100k that uh I'm desperate to get in nice and early this season ahead of chip season. So, this is what we're looking at, guys. 73 points scored in game 25. Let me know how you guys did as well. Rehea and Gabrielle doing the business with a clean sheet. Hill. James Hill. Nobody had heard of him a couple of weeks ago, but we picked him up and he is doing so so well for that 3.9 million back-to-back seven-pointers this week with Defcon and an assist. Bruno captain worked out well and Burmo pretty nice as well with the goal there. Declan Rice with the Defcon as with Anderson. Harland coming through with an assist and a penalty goal. And Ekit, how he didn't return against Man City, I have no idea. But at least his underlying numbers are continuing to be really really good and we will talk about that. But most of all guys, I want to talk about today um a little bit about transfers, but mostly about triple captain. So, let's get involved with that guys because it is such a big decision to be made. And if you need some good luck ahead of gameweek 26, some good karma, make sure you do drop a like on the video to follow along with my team. Feel free to subscribe as well. We do this every week. So, I have one free transfer, 3.2 million in the bank, all backlogged from that Sacka to Rice transfer from last week. Let's see what we're dealing with right now. We do have Rya in goal for his double gameweek. Nice guaranteed minutes there. Him actually outscoring Timber last gameweek. I wonder if that can happen again. Ryer actually in fairness has been doing just as well if not better than Timber in recent weeks. In defense, we've got the Arsenal defensive double up with Gabrielle though looking pretty nice there. Looking pretty smart there. And we've got Malik Chow and Hill here as well. Chia has been a continual disappointment over the last three game weeks. In fairness, I haven't started him every week, but I would probably be looking to start him against Spurs this week. Um, if I keep him, that is. And that is another conversation. Hill, on the other hand, against Everton, I'm pretty happy about him. I'm pretty happy about his defcon potential, and I'm just going to pretty much play him every week, I think. Well, at least most weeks for the upcoming gameweeks because Bournemouth really do look like they're improving defensively. And, uh, yeah, Defcon Hill is now kind of the second best over a six gamewe period. Hill is the second best def corner in the entire league among defenders. Only strike at leads is doing better than Hill right now. So insane defcon corn connor some assist potential apparently. And uh yeah I think clean sheets are going to be become more and more common as we go through the gameweeks. On my bench guys I do have Tvka. No way I'm starting him ahead of the double gameweek Rya. We've got Collins against Arsenal. Alderate against Liverpool. Obie just there as a a placeholder really. And we've got really a situation where I don't know who I'm going to put as my first backup defender. I'm keeping a close eye on Collins because I'm not sure what his kind of situation is with whether he's going to start starting games again. We need to keep an eye on press conferences for that one if he is out of favor or if he is going to start playing or not. Um I can give him this week at least. I don't need to make a transfer on him necessarily. But if something did come out and there's maybe some kind of issue with Collins at the moment and it looks unlikely that he'll play longterm, then maybe I do need to reconsider Collins and maybe he'll be a priority transfer out this week. But I think we can give it one more week. We can give it another round or two of press conferences and hopefully get more information on that one. Alder arguably needs to go above Collins on my bench as well at home against Liverpool. We know Sunderland can be a very tricky opposition um when they do play at home uh against any team pretty much. So um yeah, interesting one there. Maybe I do need to put Alder first on the bench, but we'll have to wait and see there. Looking through the clean sheet odds for my defenders this week, guys. And um I've got here uh I've taken this from Solio because Rob T hasn't posted at time of recording. Um we see Arsenal, of course, are going to be on top here. 38% chance of a clean sheet against Brenford, 51% chance of a clean sheet against Wolves, giving them a total projected clean sheet of 0.89. So I think we're looking at one clean sheet is probably, you know, realistic. one of out of the two games, we'll probably see a clean sheet. Um, outside of that, we do have some other teams genuinely with decent chances. Crystal Palace and Man City, for example, really, really nice numbers here. Uh, Crystal Palace at home against Burnley, uh, I'm definitely interested in that. Man City, Nottingham Forest, if you guys have players from those teams, pretty nice. As with Liverpool against Sunderland, 37%. Uh, even Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Man United looking pretty good. Maybe people expected Chelsea to be a little higher on this list, but Chelsea just not been super strong defensively. I'm looking at some of my other defenders. Uh we've got Hill 24% chance of a clean sheet against Everton, but I think uh the the markets haven't quite adjusted to Bournemouth who seemingly are improving defensively and uh 26% on Newcastle. Again, have the markets adjusted towards Newcastle seemingly incapable of keeping a clean sheet at the moment? It's looking pretty rough for them. So, those are your kind of clean sheet odds. And I think that does kind of back up why I've got kind of a Sunderland defender on the bench and a Brenford defender on the bench. Both of those have 17% uh chance of a clean sheet against their teams, which is pretty low to be fair. Pretty low indeed. So, I think I'm happy with the defenders I have on field, although maybe a transfer is needed because outside of the Arsenal guys, um none of my defenders have good clean sheet odds this week. And the plan always was originally to make a defender transfer this week to try and just improve my chances, improve my odds of of picking up a clean sheet and indeed defensive contributions as well because which is um you know super important to the way I'm playing FPL this season. Let's look at my midfield guys. Bruno and Burmo, Rice, Enzo, and Anderson. Not too much needs to be said about Bruno. I think he's just going to be a set and forget captain in those non double game weeks, if that makes sense. Looking really strong every week with so many ways of getting points. and Burmo um potentially picked up a little knock. He was seen limping out of the out of the stadium um in gameweek 25. So, small concerns there. Uh but I think he he has trained today and I think he's trained just fine. So, I think is going to be fine to play this week, but I just wanted to flag it up with you guys that there is maybe a tiny bit of concern about him kind of limping out the stadium like wondering what's going on there. Was it just cramp, a little bit of soreness? Is it just a knock with the game in a couple of days? Is there a a small chance of him being rested, rotated, whatever? And I think there is a very small chance, but I'm very much leaning towards Burmo playing and I'm not going to really action it unless there is something said in press conferences. I'm not going to, you know, sell and Burma or anything like that unless unless something big comes out, which I don't think it will. Delin Rice looks good for this gameweek. Defcon is back and with him playing a little bit of a a deeper role in gameweek 25, it could be that he is going to be more of a defcon um midfielder for the next couple of gameweeks. I mean, if he can get a nine-pointer from some defcon and um you know, two games played, then that's going to be pretty nice. But that said, being on set pieces, being on free kicks, being on corners, you never know when you're going to get the big hall. Just ask Dominic Soaslai who's got a few uh corner assist, well, mostly free kick goals recently as well, hasn't he? That could be Declan Rice next. We know that that Arsenal really alongside Manchester United with the Bruno and Burmo taking the the corners there are the set piece masters of the league. Enzo still looks good. Really good underlying numbers. Really unfortunate not to get any attacking returns last game week um against Wolves. He had had actually had much better non-penalty uh kind of expected numbers than Palmer and in infinitely better than Joel Pedro who pretty much just won two penalties and did nothing else the whole game in terms of FPL uh contributions. I'm talking of course. So Enzo I still think looks really really strong. Um the the difference between him and Palmer literally just came down to a bit of luck, bit of penalty and you know sometimes that can be an 18 point swing apparently. But yeah, that's just FPL for you guys. There's no guarantee that it's going to happen the same way this week. Though I have no real interest in upgrading Enzo to Palmer or anything like that. Some of you guys maybe will and maybe you'll value those penalties a little bit more. You'll value Palmer a little bit more. But for for me, Enzo numbers still look really good. Minutes still look really good. Still going to be on penalties when Palmer is off the pitch. Still going to have set piece share. Particularly with James injured. I'm still, you know, not really looking to sell him. And Anderson, the Defcon guy. Four points in gameweek 25. Could it be four points, five points in gameweek 26? The clean sheet odds are pretty good, so we could see a nice five-pointer for him. You never know. Could get some bonus as well given he is so busy on the pitch. Harland and Ekit are my two forwards. Maybe some confidence renewed in Harland because he scored a penalty. Yes, I know guys. Uh but the 11pointer I think will at least kind of calm the questions down about whether Harland is a cell or not. We did mention last game week Harland isn't a cell because there's not really any better options right now if you're not worried about money. He's still on penalties and the fixtures still look good. Um, you know, proof is in the pudding in gaming week 25. I think I'm just going to continue to own Harland unless, you know, something changes in terms of me needing money for something. It's just not really the case right now. And Ekit still really happy with him in terms of his performances. He's getting chances to score. He's looking really hot. And kind of if we go through some of these numbers, guys, over the past six game weeks, and this is uh a table of the past six game weeks, and we've got expected goal involvements per start. Um, we've excluded low minutes players. We've got Harland second here with 0.8 expected goal involvements per start in the past six game weeks. Really good. Enzo really high with Bruno 0.7 each. Very nice. And Burma 0.5, Rice 0.4. So, you know, even though people have kind of been down on Rice recently, it's mostly his creativity. Looks looks really strong right now. If we switch this and include players who are have low minutes as well, which would include someone like Egyp who's only started three of the last six due to injury problems. Um he's actually top of this list. So one expected goal involvements per start. Every time he starts he's expected to get one goal involvement because his xG numbers are just so high. 0.81 xG per start. That's for a non- penalty taker. Absolutely incredible. And 0.2 to expected assists per start as well in this I guess small period of games. But even across the season and we're going to see a little later on uh Ecatik's numbers whenever he starts are phenomenal. So you can forget this just being a small sample size. He is just a player with fantastic numbers and always has opportunities to score goals and sometimes to get assists as well. And I think that is going to really um improve when we get to some of these nicer fixtures after Sunderland which I think is a little bit of a tricky one. Forest may be tricky after that. amazing. The fixtures are really good for Liverpool and Echitique. So, I'm looking forward really to seeing what he can produce next. So, guys, let's talk about transfers. First of all, um I need a new defender. I think that's my priority. I'm not 100% sure I'm I'm going to do it. I could just keep Malik Chow in the defense and not make any other changes because I think my attack looks really good. I'm happy with the attack right now, at least for this game, week where I might be looking to make some changes in game 27, but for now, looks good. Um, in defense, I'm not totally convinced. I've already mentioned that my clean sheet odds outside of the Arsenal guys, not particularly high. Chia, not particularly high. Hill I have more confidence in to be fair. So, one of Chiao or Collins probably needs to go. Chiao is probably going to be the guy who I sell because I think he's probably going to drop in price soon and I'm very tight for budget when it comes to my transfer plans that we will talk about. So, right now, the player I'm looking at is a actually going to be a downgrade. I want to free up some money so I could eventually do Rice to Verts and Obi to Thiago to fill out my squad with players ready for blank gameweek 31. So that's going to be really really nice if I can manage to do that. But we need to free up just a little bit more money in order to do that in the coming gameweek. So what are we going to do? Who are we going to downgrade Malik Sha to? Well, look no further than Chris Riches. Now, I feel like I've been fairly good at picking out defenders this season, going ahead of the crowd and picking some players that are not really too many pe other people are going for. We've done Hill, we've done Collins, we've done Shia, we've found some success in all three of these guys recently. But the OG defender that I kind of I guess scouted in a way. I'm sure many of you you guys managed to scout him as well individually, independently. Um but but yeah, the first player I scouted this season was Chris Richards who looked like a really nice differential option under 1% owned at the start of the season, 4.5 million. Well, now he's 4.4 million. Still the one of the greatest defconers in the league. So defensive contributions really nice and he has his two very best fixtures for clean sheets he will have in the entire season in the next two game weeks. Burnley at home, Wolves at home. You there is no two better fixtures if you're looking for clean sheets in the Premier League. This is really really amazing stuff and I think we've just got to just got to go for it. If you need a defender for the next two game weeks and maybe a few game weeks beyond that because we also do have Richard with leads at home in gameweek 30 which I could think could be nice playable in 29 against Spurs away. Um to be fair like because he's a death corner he can be played pretty much any gameweek and it's not like he plays any like Arsenals or Liverpools or Man cities anytime soon or anything like that. And yes, he is going to be blanking in gameweek 31. But actually, because of my specific transfer plans and the way I've kind of set up my team, even if I did have too many uh too many like uh players who blank in 31, and I won't, I would still have an additional four transfers to fix it after that or three transfers to fix it after that. So, I I'm not in a position where I need to worry really about picking up players who don't play in 31 right now because I'm pretty light really and I already have plans to kind of fix a lot of these things anyway. And by the time I get to game at 31, I'll either just bench Richers and I'll still have a starting 11 or I'll sell him to someone like Anderson um at Fulham who plays against Burnley that week. Um that's a little far in in the future, guys, to be honest. But yeah, I think Riches works really well for my team. recovers me for the next two game weeks really well whilst we can continue to assess the Collins situation. Meanwhile, Alder is also going to be available as a potential play next week. Hill is a good play every single game week as is Gabrielle. So, I think this will really really sort out my defense. Um, you know, which is maybe starting to show a little bit of a few cracks this gameweek that that definitely could be improved upon. So, yeah, shout to Richards. Uh, that looks like the move. It just looks like the move. So, with that said, guys, with the transfer done, I I did say that I wanted to spend a little bit of time today on triple captain talk because I think this is probably the biggest topic of the day. It really is. And a lot of you guys will be wondering, shall I pull the trigger on the triple captain? And I think it's really important to know kind of what the alternatives are. You know, if if we're going for triple captain against Gabrielle or in Gabrielle this week, for example, what are the other options? you know, what are we missing out on if we go for it this week essentially is what I'm trying to say. And is it actually worth waiting? Well, let's go through that right now, guys. So, let's start off right here. And this is a table of players and their points per start in the Premier League so far this season. And we see an a nice clear top three here. Harland 7.54 uh points per start this this season. He's only just overtaken literally this game he's only just overtaken Gabrielle who was on 7.44 points per start. So prior to uh the hall from Harland in gameweek 25, Gabrielle was actually on top here. In third place we have Bruno Fernandez a little bit further behind at 6.41 points per start. Um by the way shout out to Ecadik who is in fourth place. Six points per start. I told you guys he is a good pick. You just got to you just got to start games. Uh he will get opportunities. There are some other players who are pretty high hit as well, but I think there's not really too much point in looking outside of Harland, Gabrielle, and Bruno. I think these are the three standout players in the Premier League this season when you're looking to get yourself some nice FPL points. So, what we need to do next is kind of identify double game weeks. We know Gabrielle has a double gameweek in gameweek 26 right now, but what about the other guys? What are these kind of double game weeks going to look like? Can we beat Gabrielle against uh Brenford and Wolves? Can we do better than that? Well, let's let's have a look. So, let's uh take a look at this double gameweek table, guys. I update this regularly throughout the season, and this is my predictions for the double when the double game weeks are going to be and also what the double game will be as well for each team. So, we need to look at Manchester United first of all, and and kind of talk about Bruno. And there is only one scenario in which Manchester United can get a double game this season or at least one likely scenario realistic scenario because likely is is uh pushing it a little bit. And the only way it can happen is if Brenford reach the semifinals of the FA Cup. If Brenford reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, they will very likely have their fixture from gameweek 34 against Manchester United moved into gameweek 33, creating a Manchester United double gameweek of Chelsea away and Brenford at home. So, that is the best realistic way we're looking at Manchester United getting a double gameweek this season. The problem is, of course, with that is number one, um, we've got to get Brenford to the FA Cup semi-finals first. And I don't know how likely that is. Don't get me wrong, it's possible, but are we going to be counting on that happening? I don't know. It's it's really risky. We have a double gameweek right now. Are we really going to bet on Manchester United maybe getting a double gameweek when it's not even guaranteed? I don't know. The second problem is that gameweek 33 looks so much better for a bench boost or a free hit. Because it's going to be the largest double gameweek of the season, we need to use our chips that really benefit having a large amount of double game weeks. With the triple captain chip, you only need one team. I mean, it's technically not possible. You have to have two teams, but you only need one team to have a double game week and suddenly you've got a scenario where actually is possible for one only one team to have a double game. That's a whole other tangent. Um, it is technically possible, but anyway, um, you only need one team to have a double game week in order to use the triple captainship because the chip is focused on just one player. Whereas your free hit and your bench boost, a large amount of double game weeks, that is where you see the real benefit of those chips. So gameweek 33 for me is going to be a bench boost week with gameweek 34 is going to be my free hit week. I'm confident about this strategy, really confident, and we will be doing another chip strategy video very soon where we'll be talking a little bit more, narrowing things down a little bit more and exploring maybe some alternatives. But for me, I can't see a world in which I don't use either the bench boost or free hit in gameweek 33. They're just so much more going to be so much more effective in the biggest double game week of the season which should see around eight teams double. So triple captain for gameweek 33 is just ruled out for me. It's not happening. I'm sorry. It's just it's not happening. So we need to look at any possible double gameweeks outside of gameweek 33. Is there anything else that's possible? And there is. There is indeed. So, one thing about the fact that uh the Man City versus Crystal Palace game has been moved out of gameweek 31 and it's not been rescheduled into gameweek 26 just because of cup clashes or or you know clashes with uh Crystal Palace playing in the Europa Conference League. Um you know they they're not available to play in the midweek of 26 27. So, the most likely uh places where this Crystal Palace game against Man City will be kind of placed is either gameweek 33 or gameweek 36. It's going to be one of those two. So, we are going to see most likely, you know, like 99% we're going to see at least one Manchester City double game week this season. One of which will be uh somewhere with, you know, Crystal Palace going in somewhere whether that's 33 or 36. So, we could see Arsen uh we could see Man City against Arsenal and Crystal Palace in 33. We kind of already ruled that out. Or most likely gameweek 36 where we'd see Burn Brenford uh at home and Crystal Palace at home potentially there as well. Could also be gameweek 35. That's a whole other thing. But one of gameweek 35 or 36 will be that second double gameweek for Man City because we also have the FA Cup scenario. So if one of Manchester City or Burnley reached the FA Cup semi-final and I'd say that's much more likely than Brenford reach Brenford in isolation reaching the FA Cup semi-finals then that is going to create that second double gameweek. That is going to mean that not only will we need fixtures rescheduling into gameweek 33 but we'll also need that fixture as we mentioned rescheduled into 35 or 36. So, it's basically going to be either Crystal Palace or Burnley are going to be the kind of additional fixture for Man City in most likely gameweek 36, possibly gameweek 35. So, if we're looking at kind of triple captain opportunities there, you're looking at Harland really against uh if if it's gameweek 36, it's going to be against Brenford at home and one of Burnley or Crystal Palace or maybe and less likely gameweek 35 Everton away and again one of Crystal Palace or Burnley. We don't know which one it's going to be. It kind of depends what happens. I think it's more likely it will be Burnley put in there to be honest. So, that is what a Man City and that's what a Harland uh double game week could look like. So, we got Arsenal, we got Gabrielle against Brenford and Wolves. Or we've got the possibility of uh Harland against one of Everton or Brenford and then one of Burnley or Crystal Palace. That maybe looks a bit better with Harland. Do you guys agree? I don't know, maybe you will, maybe you won't, but maybe that looks a little bit better, the Harland option. Um because those are nice fixtures, particularly if Burnley gets put in there. That's really nice indeed. But there are three problems with the Harland triple captain in that kind of gameweek 36/game35 kind of area. The first problem is we don't actually know it will happen. Of course it is likely that Man City or Burnley do reach the FA Cup semi-final, more likely Man City, sorry Burnley fans. But that is pretty likely, but it's not guaranteed. And if it doesn't happen, well then there's no double game week in 35 or 36 for Man City. It just doesn't happen. then you're pretty much going to have to commit to using a triple captain on a single game week unless some of the kind of outlier kind of chances of some more double game weeks maybe in 36 or 37 do come true because there are still some other possibilities. There are still some other possibilities and we'll talk about them and we'll explore them later on when we do the next chip strategy video. Um there are some other opportunities but if we're looking at Harland specifically is this game 36 you want really or maybe game 35 that's what you want from him. So, it's not guaranteed to happen, but it's likely to happen. Next problem. Okay. What if Harland gets injured? If Harland gets injured, would you be as comfortable doing a triple captain on a Marmoo or a uh Bill Foden or a Ryan Chery? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. So, maybe Semeno to be fair. Maybe Semeno. But would you be as comfortable if you know Harland got an injury at some point between now and in literally months time? We're talking like two and a half, three months. This is we're talking like May before the next d this uh this double next triple captain opportunity is going to be like April May kind of time. So we're talking months in advance. So would you be comfortable if Harland got injured captaining a different Man City player? Maybe, maybe not. And the third problem is what about rotation? So say Man City are in the FA Cup kind of semifinals. They're in they're going far in the Champions League as well. They've got all of these fixtures in all of these competitions that they're competing for. What if Harland needs a rest against a team like Burnley in gameweek 36? Because gameweek 37 will be just a couple of days after. So, will it be prime time to rest someone like Harland in what is maybe on paper an easier fixture where Marmush could do a pretty good job there if he was required to? Maybe. So we could see that Harland is maybe rotation risk later in this in the season, particularly if Manchester United are still competing in other competitions and particularly even more if maybe Man City are out of the title race because there is a scenario in which Man City are out of the title race by gameweek 36 or at least the second game of gameweek 36 and as such just completely prioritize other competitions and you know in that case Harland really high chance of of being arrested. So, lots of variables there with the Harland triple captain potential. Lots of variables indeed. And I think it really comes down to your appetite. So, just to just to reframe it in a nice and simple way, you are looking at either Gabrielle right now, you know, he's fit, he's available, he is likely to start both games against Brenford and Wolves. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. Not I don't want to say it looks perfect, but it looks pretty good. The other alternative realistically kind of that looks kind of, you know, convincing right now as a realistic possibility is Harland against probably Brenford in gamewick 36 and one of Burnley or Crystal Palace, more likely Burnley in my opinion. The Man City one, the Harland one, it looks better, but it comes with significant risks. When you put all of the risk factors together, it comes with significant risks. So, you kind of need to make a decision. Do you want to stick or do you want to twist? Do you want to go for what you know is in front of you? Do you want to take uh the bird in the hand if you like or do you fancy a go at the two in the bush? And uh certainly Harland Gaming 36 is two in the bush. Uh so yeah uh we'll see. We'll see what happens uh with all of that. I'm not really here to tell you which option you should be taking. I don't think and I think it you just kind of have to make a decision. Do I want to play it safe? Do I want to take a risk? I'd rather you guys have the information um available to you and know kind of a realistic outlay of what the options are um so you can make a realistic, you know, a comfortable decision for yourself. But for me, I just feel I would rather take the bird in the hand. Um I'm an Arsenal fan. I would love to support an Arsenal triple captain. I've not really been able to do that in recent years playing FPL. I really like the look of this one. And I think with Gabrielle there are there is some real potential to get a mega score here. I don't know how likely it is to happen but let's kind of figure it out. So I'm thinking Gabrielle triple captain. I'm like 80% triple captain Gabrielle for this gameweek for the kind of reasons we've already outlaid. What am I expecting from here? Well realistically let's go through. So clean sheet odds. We've got a projected clean sheets of 0.89. So let's say one clean sheet and maybe the other game Arsenal concede one goal. I think that's a pretty arsenal thing to do. So immediately you've got four points for playing. You've got one clean sheet. That's takes us to eight points. Then we look at Defcon next. And how likely is that to happen? Well, let's go back to Tom Hadley's uh graphic here that he posted a couple of weeks ago about the teams that give away Defcon points the most. Brenford give away defcon points to center backs 50% of the time. And we see Wolves give away Defcon points to center backs around 30% of the time. and Gabrielle in general gets Defcon points in around one in three games as well. So I think it is I think it is reasonable to expect uh defensive contribution points in one of the two games. So one clean sheet, one hit of the defcon, that takes us to 10 points without really doing very much. You add bonus points to that, maybe one bonus point, 11 points. That's a pretty basic scenario. uh a very realistic, you know, low expectations kind of scenario where he gets 11 points for a triple captain, 33 points. I think I'd be okay with it. I think I would be okay with that. But it could be so much more because what if we get extra bonus points? What if we get Defcon in both games? What if we get clean sheets in both games? What if we get, heaven forbid, a goal in one of the games? It is so so possible for Gabrielle. He's due a bullet header, right guys? And he has been kind of popping them in, you know, pretty regularly. If we go through his kind of expected numbers throughout the season, we expect an attacking return once every I don't know like five or six games, which what gives us I don't know over a double game week maybe a I don't know like maybe like a 60% chance maybe. Is that too much? No, like a 30% chance maybe of an attacking return. I don't know. It gives us like a 30% chance of an attacking return. 30 to 40% chance which I think isn't too bad. So I think 10 11 points as a base and then maybe a 30% chance let's be conservative of an attacking return on top of that which would push up the bonus points as well. I don't know guys there is a lot of potential here and you know if everything goes exactly to plan there is no reason why Gabrielle can't come away from this gameweek with like a 20 plus pointer this week. It's so possible. you know, if he gets the the clean sheet defcon um and goal combo, that's 17 points if he just does that in one of the two games. If he can do anything in the second game as well, we're looking at 20 points plus. And and that is just a monster monster score that is going to be hard to match even for Harland later on in the season. It's not going to be an easy feat to match. So, yeah, that's where I'm at right now, guys. I I think triple captain Gabrielle 26 is potentially the one because, you know, we know the scenario right now. We know the potential and uh it just seems like the sensible thing to do. Maybe too sensible for some people, but I'm not got a problem with it. So, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Triple captain, vice captain, by the way, is on Declan Rice. Um, in case anyone cares, but I mean, I'm not I'm not expecting or I'm I'm really hoping that that is not needed uh this week. Let's put it that way. Let's check out some of my transfer moves. Uh moving forward, we're are we are on of course on the uh fantasy football hub my team tool. If you want to check this out, use the link in the description and you can get a nice free trial to get full access to all of the hub tools. So yeah, we've spoken about gameweek 26 already. I'm still got pretty much the same plan of moving uh like I said Obi to Thiago and then in gameweek 28 maybe. Uh it will be one or the other. I don't know who I'll do first, but probably this way round and it'll be vert in for gaming 28 in this example. Um, which I know it keeps telling me that I'll be minus four in the bank, but it's just not true. I I can definitely afford this. In fact, I have.1 million to spare uh when making these transfers as well. So, that is what my my team will look like kind of gameweek 28. From there, I'll probably be looking to downgrade Enzo. I mean, I'll definitely play verse over Enzo, by the way. Um, but uh I'll be looking to, you know, take away Enzo out of the team uh at some point after that. Might not be in game at 28. Um, maybe game it 29. Maybe do something like Enzo to Wilson because I think Wilson's good fixtures start from there. West Ham uh through to Burnley in 31. So something like that. And then we can throw Wilson on the team. Maybe we don't have to play Anderson against Man City in that scenario. And then uh etc etc. Gameweek 30 will start to look better. We mentioned gameweek 31 maybe doing something like uh Richards to um Anderson as well. But again, we're going to have spare transfers in case anything goes wrong. This is kind arguably a bit of a luxury move and it would kind of leave our team looking something. We play Collins, assuming Collins is still playing, by the way, guys, because that could be an issue I need to deal with. But assuming Collins is playing, it leaves us with something a little bit like this. So, uh we'll have a full 11. um a full 11 for gaming 31 and a player on the bench and you know transfers to spare on top of that as well. And yes, I can afford it even though the screen is telling you I can't I definitely can. I've checked this out already. So yeah, something like that for gameweek 31 think could be pretty nice indeed. Um I'm I'm well planned, well prepared I think for gameweek 31 without having to use a free hit ship or anything like that. But anyway guys, that's going to be it for today. Please do drop a like. Please do subscribe as well. And let me know your thoughts on the triple captain situation this week as well. If you have any other questions surrounding it, I'll be more than happy to try and help you guys out with regards to chips and and strategy and doubles and blanks and all that stuff, guys, cuz I usually think I I I know what I'm talking about when it comes to this kind of thing. It's like maybe one of my specialties, but who knows, guys. Thanks for watching. Check out Keeper Void if you haven't done already, and I will see you tomorrow for 100 experts. See you later, mates. Bye-bye."

      "transcript": "Gameweek 26 is here already and guys, it is the first double game rig of the season. So, I'm sure a few of you guys will be looking to make some transfers. Well, let's see who we should buy in this week's buyer void. This video is split into two parts. The first of which we'll be looking at those players you may already have in your team and which ones you should keep and which ones you should sell. Then, we'll be looking at players you might not have and which players you should buy and which players you should avoid. plays will be tier listed with the best plays at the top and the worst ones at the bottom. Welcome to FBM. My name is Dan. Yes, guys. A Tuesday deadline means an early buy, sell, keep, avoid episode today, guys. Unfortunately, we are recording this video before the Sunday games, but we've had eight out of 10 gameweek 25 games done now. So, I think we can make some pretty good assumptions. And to be honest, we're mostly looking at Arsenal anyway, aren't we, right now? But let's go through things anyway. So, we got to start off with those forwards you might already have in your team. And I think Harland, even though he hasn't played yet, assuming he is even starting on Sunday, some of you guys will know more than me right now about Harland, but I think over the long term, we are going to see him start regularly. The next game after the Liverpool game is going to be against Fulham at home, and I think that is a decent fixture. Have Newcastle at home, Newcastle team that still conceding plenty of goals there as well, followed by Leads and an out of form Nottingham Forest at home. So, there are still some really good fixtures for Harland coming up. So assuming he is starting and I don't see why he wouldn't be when we come to these fixtures, I think there is still going to be plenty of opportunities and I think by removing Harland from your team, you are taking such an enormous risk that's probably just not worthwhile. So provided you don't need the money and for most people they're not going to need the money. Harland is just going to be a keep. His underlying data is still very strong. He's still the penalty taker at Manchester City and the fixtures are good enough for him as well. So no strong reason to sell in my opinion. Ektika is also going to be a keep here. I I think the Sunderland away game is maybe a little bit tricky. Um but I think Forest is maybe turning into a slightly easier fixture on recent form and after that we got likes of West Ham and Wolves there as well. So I like the look of Eatique really for this run of fixtures. He's clearly in redhot form at the moment. No pun intended and I think he is going to continue to deliver. He's got some of the best underlying numbers in the entire league per I guess 90 minutes. But the problem has been whether he's going to be playing or not. Recently, we've seen him play three games. One of them was a sub appearance. 1.83 xG and 0.61 xa during that time is really good numbers for the limited minutes he's had play. So, as long as he keeps playing, which I think he should do now, he is getting back to his full fitness. Each is still long-term absent. I think Ekit is going to be great. Thiago is the other player I would definitely be looking to keep. Now, um if you've sold him recently, maybe you missed out on his five-pointer in game meet 25. not the worst thing in the world, but if you did keep him, you got that. And even though you're probably going to be looking to bench him against Arsenal. Hopefully, you can cover him for this week. I don't think it would be the end of the world if you had to play him against uh Arsenal in 26, but ideally you would bench him. But I think the thing is here, his fixtures from gameweek 27 or more particularly from gameweek 28 are just so good. And I think a lot of people will be looking to buy Thiago after this gameweek. So if you already have him, you can essentially save yourself a transfer just by holding on to him one week against Arsenal. Hopefully bench him and after that I think the points will definitely come and I think next week's by seller void video. We're going to be looking to put Thiago in the buy section very very heavily. In fact, maybe even the top of the buy section for forwards into our monitors. I think Watkins even though he is a bit expensive, his numbers are okay. He's back and available of course as we know and the fixtures are pretty decent over the next four. But even that Chelsea at home game, I don't mind for Watkins too much. Chelsea still conceding plenty of chances we as we see week on week. Um not sure if Watkins is going to be the penalty taker or not. I think there's a lot of people speculating around who will be the next penalty taker for Aston Villa. So yeah, no promises there, but certainly you know his numbers are okay. The fixtures are good. His price is a little high, which is why he's not necessarily a keep, but a very high monitor. After that, we have got the Bournemouth boys. Creepy Junior unlucky not to score in gameweek 25. Um his ball striking is just absolutely incredible. And in terms of value for money, he is definitely a pick that is uh definitely proving some value there. So if you are, you know, you are Krooppy owner, you're not really looking at any other forwards right now. I think he's absolutely fine to keep. And to be fair, he's fine to play in each of the next four game weeks as So if you you're a Thiago and Krooppy Junior owner for example, you can bench Thiago in a game like 26 and you can play Krooppy instead. Evan Nilson's a really tough one. I think he was another player really unlucky in gameweek 25. Martinez had a really good game um for Aston Villa against Bournemouth in 25 and Evan Nilson had some real opportunities not just to score but also to assist. His underlying numbers are still very strong as you can see and the fixtures are decent. Um, however, obviously there has been a couple of blanks here and Evan Nlson being such a differential player may be a risky player to hold, but generally speaking, unless you have, you know, another forward who you're really keen on, all of these players in the monitor section, I would probably just look to keep Calbertt Lewen. Obviously, the fixtures in the next three are not ideal. Even Sunderland at 29, you may have a a different reading on that fixture and actually think that's a tough fixture as well, but his numbers are okay. He's cheap. is on penalties. There are some stills some things to like about Calbertt Lewin. I think the problem is a lot of these forwards um that we have in our teams right now are kind of average. So, you know, you have to kind of look at it. Is there another forward who you're really keen to get? If so, maybe some of these players could be sacrificed. But again, I wouldn't be rushing Calvin Leuen out the door unless you kind of needed to, unless you really really felt strongly about it. And in the cell category, I'm going to put Bowen here. Um the fixtures coming up are tougher. Um, Man United have been a strong defense recently as have uh Liverpool. Even Bournemouth are improving defensively as well. But here's the problem with Bowen. He has scored two goals in the last six game weeks, which looks great on paper, but one of them was a penalty and the other one was a cross that somehow found the back of the net. Um, so I would say that maybe Bowen has been a little fortunate in his returns. Of course, you were going to keep him against Burnley for the upside in that game, but now that that Burnley fixture is out the way, I think I would be much more comfortable selling Bowen because really his underlying numbers compared to a lot of the other forwards are pretty low. He's kind of the lowest on this list out of him and all of the players above him, as you can see on this list, just 1.5 xG. Considering he's played six games, one of those, well, most of that XG was the penalty that he took. It's kind of very difficult to kind of justify keeping him at 7.7 million. Well, Tomato with his continued rotation risk is going to continue to be a cell and Mateta some kind of long-term injury that he's got right now may require surgery. We'll find that out in the next couple of days. But it looks like he is going to be a player who is in the best case scenario like plays some games but is managed his minutes managed. Of course, Crystal Palace have signed a new striker who we will talk about today. So, I think Mateta is going to be a pretty straightforward sell because uh yeah, it looks like he is could be out really for the long term here into the midfield. Um, Declan Rice, did he blank in gameweek 25? It's up to you what you think a blank is. He did get defensive contributions and the clean sheet. So, a five-pointer for Rice. I don't know. It's kind of this the equivalent of a player getting an assist and no bonus point and no clean sheet, isn't it? So, it's not the end of the world. Uh, wasn't the worst score in the world. And I think we have seen recently that that Rice's creative numbers are really strong. 16 key passes, 1.67 expected assists. This is some of the highest numbers you'll see um from uh from a creative point of view um over the last few game weeks, over the last six really. So, I think Rice is still a really good pick. I definitely would not be looking to sell him or swap him for a different Arsenal player ahead of the double game week. So, he's going to be a really really straightforward keep for me even though some people are selling because they are a little bit uh maybe concerned about some of the blanks recently. But the data is there, the defcons are there, the double game week's there. No reason to sell. Um, but although I would maybe say gameweek 27, we could maybe reconsider that a little bit because maybe Rice has been playing a little bit deeper than usual recently, but that's just going to get you more Defcon. So, it's not, you know, there just different ways of looking at it. Still on those set pieces, so still going to have opportunities in that way. Rogers definitely going to be a keep. I know a lot of people have been worried about Rogers recently in gameweek 25 or ahead of gameweek 25. So many people were selling him. He was a Rogers was a keep last week. He's going to be a keep again this week. I think people maybe lost a bit of patience on Rogers and some people punished last game week and if you're still thinking about selling Rogers I think you could be punished even more because Aston Villa their fixtures are reasonably strong now in the next four gamew weeks really all the way up until gameweek 31 where they face West Ham in 31 where some people may even be thinking about captaining Rogers when kind of we see Arsenal and Man City with the blank gameweek in 31. Rogers could be your your captain actually. So, yeah, really a a hold all the way until gameweek 31. If you're a wild carding in 32, he's going to take you all the way up there um with plenty of returns, I'm sure, in this period. Enzo with a blank in gameweek 25, a disappointing one at that because he did perform really well in that game, at least from a u an analytical point of view, had some good opportunities to score. One in particular, created a huge chance for Netto towards the end of the game, which Netto completely whiffed. Um so, that was a bit of a shame. It's just a case of, you know, Enzo blanking for one week and I think maybe people lose patience, but the numbers are still good. Very good. In fact, you can kind of see this 2.65 xG, 1.29 XA. Really, really strong numbers here. Four big chances. Of course, there has been a penalty in there as well. And the next two fixtures, Leadeds and Burnley at home. Everything is looking pretty positive for Enzo. So, not a player I would really be looking to sell, although I wouldn't necessarily buy him either because if you are buying him, he is a pretty short-term pick. We have also seen from Cole Palmer that Cole Palmer is still not fully fit and he is still, you know, having to have his minutes managed somewhat, which means there will always be, you know, a period of the game where Enzo is the penalty taker because when Palmer isn't on the pitch, Enzo is the penalty taker and there are going to be moments when Palmer is off the pitch. So, there we go. We'll move on to Wilson in Monitor. The next two fixtures are pretty rough for him, but he's another player similar to Rogers where he's a really nice player to take all the way up to a gameweek 32 wild card. So, if you are planning on the wild card in gameweek 32, then he's definitely going to be a keep for you because we've got Burnley in gameweek 31. So, Wilson is going to be actually one of the best picks in gameweek 31 in a week where there's a lot going to be a lot of players missing. So, that's really nice. the next two game weeks. I'm hoping that owners can maybe bench him against Man City away, Sunderland away, may maybe Spurs at home. Not sure on that fixture. You never really know what you're going to get with Spurs, but I think Wilson is definitely playable at the very least against uh Spurs and arguably against Sunderland as well, but that has been a tricky away fixture for teams in the Premier League this season. Uh plenty of shots from Wilson. XG numbers pretty good. A little bit of an overperformance there in terms of goals, but an underperformance in terms of his creativity. no assists from 1.11 expected assists there. So that is uh maybe somewhere he can improve. But overall, as long as you can bench Wilson, I would keep him. If you can't, you know, that maybe does drop him down a little bit. So is an interesting one. I think we are going to see some rotation at some point, but I don't really know when it's going to be. The next few fixtures are good as we know for Man City. They do have some strong fixtures, but those with one eye on gameweek 31 will be thinking, you know, Semeno blank gameweek 31. Do I really want to keep him in the long term? Maybe not. If you're looking for a new midfielder, and I think to be fair, the the standard of midfielder, the kind of your expectations of what you should get from a midfielder should be very high right now because there are so many great midfield options. So, I think that does drop Semeno down into monitor. But a very low priority sell like I would only sell him again if if there's someone you really really like the look of. Kuna, I think, is where we start to get creep in a few more concerns. So has the concern of the blank gameweek coming up but aside from that looks good. Kuna the fixtures are good. He is getting FPL points but he is vastly overperforming here. Three goals and one assist from what's that 0.9 expected goal involvements or returns from 0.9 expected goal involvements. That is a big overperformance. Obviously, he scored a few worldy wonder goals recently, but one concern is he is getting substituted off a little bit early in games and he seems to be the first sub in every single game getting subbed off for Shesho and given that it seems to be working this kind of strategy from Michael Carrick and Manchester United. I do think that's going to continue. So, what is your expectation here? Are you expecting Kuna to continue to score like wonder goals in the kind of 60 70 minutes that he plays each game week? Maybe, maybe you are. Maybe that can happen and maybe he can improve his numbers too. That can happen too. The fixtures are certainly good enough for to to allow that to happen. But if we have very high standards of what we're expecting from midfielders right now, does Kuna quite cut the mustard? I don't know. That's going to be up to you. He is definitely a player we need to be keeping an eye on throughout this uh period whilst his minutes are reduced and while he's not getting those high xG chances and kind of high volume of chances either. And Jai is a really really uh disappointing one really. I had much higher hopes from him. Um I think we are maybe edging towards Anjai being a cell. Everton in attack maybe not completely clicking right now. Um obviously you know they scored a couple of goals against Fulham. Um but for a lot of that game they they they didn't look too good to be honest. Uh certainly in the first periods of the game they did not look great. And Jay is not really getting the opportunities that we'd hoped from him. He's had three game weeks now back since AFCON and he's barely mustered up any shots. three shots, two key passes. I'm just not sure this is good enough when we are we do have such a high standard of midfielder. So in that case, I feel enjoy is wandering towards the cell section at this point. And then we've got some players which who just are cells. So Foden is going to be a cell. Continued rotation risk and very expensive. Gordon, I think it's going to be very difficult to get any kind of real information about his injury status because Eddie How is a liar in his press conferences. And Bayio Saka looks like he is going to be out for at least the first game of the double game week and probably the second as well. And given that we do need to make sure we do have our three Arsenal players in place for the double game week. Saka is just going to be a cell. Let's check out some defenders guys. Chaloba first of all if you have him I think you got to keep him. Two game weeks really really nice couple of weeks for him here. I wouldn't necessarily buy Chalaba but for the next two you keep him. He has been one of the best defensive contribution defenders over this six gameweek period and I think that's probably going to continue into the next fixtures as well. So even if Chelsea do lose their clean sheets and they will lose the occasional clean sheet. We know that Chelsea are still conceding so many chances um you're still going to have defcon to back you up and you know leads at home burning at home even if you are a you know one of the weaker defenses in the league you're still going to have a chance in some of the more favorable fixtures whilst playing at home. So for the next two weeks, Chaloba, I think he is going to be an absolutely great keep from 28 onwards though, probably going to be a great sell. So Mark Gay is going to be the next player here. If you bought him at a cheap price, I would just continue to own him through this period of games. You are probably going to have to sell him by gameweek 31 because of that blank gameweek. But for the time being, I think he is going to be absolutely fine. Um, actually has had some opportunities to score uh well goals and assists recently, but hasn't quite come off. Defcon's a complete myth with him though. Not looking likely at all. Mukle, a player I would look to keep, would bench him for gameweek 26, but particularly again if you got him at a low price, I'll be looking to keep him and probably play him in that Fulham game. Maybe that leads game in 29 as well. Definitely going to be a really nice rotation option over the next period of games. Even if uh Liverpool in 26 isn't ideal. So no patience lost on Mukle quite yet. Collins is one to monitor. Now, if Collins had played in gameweek 25, if he had started, I would definitely put him in the keep section, but he's actually dropped into monitor. Now, you know, Arsenal next, I think you're probably going to, if he's playing, you're probably going to just bench him for this game week and then play him for some great fixtures that are coming up very soon for Brenford. But there is just this this uh kind of concern around is he like a first choice player for Brenford anymore. I think the answer is probably yes. He missed out gameweek 24 with a knock. Gameweek 25, I think, because the the center back pairing of Aya and Vandenberg did so well in gameweek 25 uh in 24, it was kind of kept on in gameweek 25. So, same two center backs. But with two goals conceded against Newcastle, I wonder if maybe we could see probably Vandenberg drop out and Collins come back in. Now, I think the good thing about Collins is the fact that you are going to probably bench him in 26 anyway. hopefully plan to bench him in 26 regardless. And if so, you're going to get one more week of information about whether he is going to continue to be or whether he's going to be the starting center back. I think he probably should be. There's been high praise around Collins from Andrews and I do think that he is probably first to us and he's, you know, he's the captain of the team as well. So, it's a really really interesting one. Um, difficult to get a read on it to be honest, guys. He's still an amazing defcon defender. when he plays, I think there's going to be great opportunities for clean sheets. If I knew he was nailed, I would love to have him for for the run after the Arsenal game. So, one to keep an eye on throughout the week, guys. Hopefully, we can get a better read on that very soon. Malik Chow. Um, yeah, maybe you are starting to think about selling Chiao right now. Um, even though I don't mind the Spurs fixture and I don't mind the Everton fixture in 28 either. It's 27 Man City, 29, Man United. Don't particularly love them. And it's just Newcastle just not keeping clean sheets right now. They're conceding way too many goals. 12 goals conceded in six game weeks. This is not good enough. Even though I mean look at these underlying numbers, man. 6.6 non-penalty expected goals against for Newcastle in this six gameweek period. And yet they've conceded 12. So unless they can start to regress to their mean or progress to their mean, I guess in terms of that that are those expected numbers versus the actual numbers, I'm worried about Newcastle defenders generally. And I'm worried that there's the fixes aren't good enough to justify keeping them. Maybe one to monitor. I think there are higher priority sales. Tarovski, for example, Everton are just not looking good defensively right now. The defensive contributions for Tarovski are seemingly, you know, lowering. They're going to getting gradually lower. And the next three fixtures, I don't really know if there's going to be any clean sheets in this run of fixtures. Particularly that Everson are just conceding so many chances. And maybe we don't even have Defcon to kind of back us up with Tarovski. I would be maybe more um more I don't know generous with Tarovski if he wasn't 5.8 million, but he is so expensive and I don't know if he's justifying it right now. Vanerven is going to be another monitor. Just pretty average fixtures generally here for Vanerven. So, uh yeah, maybe who could replace him, but at least he's a body. Rhys James probably going to be a cell given his he's his has an injury issue right now and the next fixture against Leeds is in just a couple of days time. Not sure if he's going to recover in time for that. Although I do think he will probably play against Burnley in 27 if he is uh back and available. But again, because the fixes after Burnley are so poor for Chelsea, you may as well sell him now, particularly at 5.7 million. Du continues to be a sell. Um, he is still out for what, probably 8 and 1/2 game weeks now. Or sorry, 8 and a half weeks. He's going to be out now since it was like 10 game weeks when he was originally injured. Or sorry, 10 weeks when he was originally injured. It's been a week and a half since his injury. Yeah, he's out for another eight and a half weeks. There you go. Romero three game, no, four game suspension, isn't it? Four game suspension for his second red card of the season. Terrible stuff, but yeah, definitely going to be a cell there if you do have him in your squad. By the way, guys, don't forget to like the video uh today and do subscribe if you want to follow along with these transfer tips every single game week. We've got some tight deadlines, but plenty of videos to come this week. Okay, let's go to forwards to buy. And again, I'm going to say a similar thing to uh kind of what I said last game week. I not really looking at many forward transfers right now, but some people will be in a situation where they kind of have to buy a forward or are desperate to buy a new forward. If so, Ekit I think looks good for the kind of medium term. So I think he is a player you can pick up now and just be confident with going forward all the way up until you know the gameweek 32 wild card or potentially even beyond that as well if even if you're not wild carding in gameweek 32. So he looks really strong at the moment. Great form, great underlying numbers. Fixtures I think are good enough particularly after gameweek 26. So a nice long-term option there. Jah Pedro not really so much of a long-term option. Next two gameweeks look great for him like genuinely really really good but after that Chelsea do have horrible fixtures. So, if you are looking for something ultra short-term, then maybe Joel Pedro is your guy. Maybe some rotation risk there. And it should be said, I know a lot of people look at his gameweek 25 score and think, \"Wow, he must have had an amazing game.\" He absolutely didn't. Um, he took like one shot, made no key passes whatsoever, super low xG, super low XA, came away with two assists because he won two penalties. Um, so he got a lot of points for doing very little. And as you can see on screen, guys, the underlying numbers aren't really there. To take seven shots in six game weeks is not ideal, particularly with two key passes. Seven shots. These are really low numbers, but the fixes are good. We have seen him be fairly clinical in recent uh gameweeks, which you might consider to be good form. Mane is the other player I'm going to put in the buy category here just because he has a double gameweek basically. But remember guys, if you buy Mane or indeed any Wolves player this week, you are probably well probably gonna have to transfer them out in gaming 31 when they do have a blank. So ultimately, if you're buying a Wolves player, you are spending two transfers on a Wolves player. One to bring them in this week and another to take them out next week. So you kind of have to factor that in if you are going for them. That said, Mar still looking good, taking set pieces, corners, free kicks, which is nice. Did hit the woodwork as well in game weeks 25. So maybe a little unfortunate not to get returns. And look, the numbers are good here in terms of the shot volume. These are good. You know, key passes, these are not bad, though. I don't mind Mané at all for that value for money. Um, let's see what he can do in game 26. Now, the Forest are looking a little worse as we saw against Leads where they had a really poor performance. I'm kind of a bit feeling a bit more bullish about Mané because we know a two-pointer is probably what's going to happen against Arsenal in the second of the double game. Right, Jockarez? Where do we rate him? um he's going to be a high monitor and I think really that the risk you take with Joarez is missing out on the other Arsenal guys. You're going to probably want to have double defense as a minimum from Arsenal across this double game. You're going to be picking one more guy. Is it going to be Declan Rice? Is it going to be a third Arsenal defender/goalkeeper? Is it going to be someone else or is it going to be Yarez? If you want to take a risk with Yarez, fair enough. There is some rotation risk there as we have seen benched again in game week 25. He did come off the bench and score a couple of goals and his form is improving with Saka out. We expect him to be the penalty taker as well. So there gen genuinely is some things to like about Yarez at the moment but it is risky. He's only taken again just like Joel Petro seven shots two key passes during this period. He's 8.7 million. At that kind of price you're probably going to be bringing him in in 26 and then selling him again in 27 because the value for money is not quite there. I do wonder if there maybe is some kind of play where you bring in Yokarez for one week and then move him to Echit next week or something like that could potentially work, but ultimately there are some risk factors with Jockz. If you're happy to take that on, I don't think it's the worst move in the world. I really really don't. And that's maybe I maybe wouldn't have said that a couple of weeks ago, but now I'm kind of open to the idea of a risky Jockarez differential. I think outside of, you know, your main guys, the defenders, your your Rya, your Declan Rice, outside of those guys, I think Yarez is my next favorite Arsenal pick. Certainly more so than any other of the non Rice midfielders. Um, to be honest, so yeah, put him high monitor, but the risk is sacrificing your other, you know, one of your other Arsenal players, I guess. Creeper Jr. could buy potentially if you would want to, if you're looking for something cheap, fixtures are reasonably good. Um, Strand Larsson is interesting as a differential if you fancy him to start some games. I think the fixtures are certainly good enough for Crystal Palace, particularly in the next two where he could get some returns here. We can't really speak much about his data. I'm interested to see how he plays uh today as I record this video to see if there is any promise there if he is even starting that is. Um, so it's going to be a really interesting one. Strand Larson and one to monitor at the very least. If you are going to go for him though, it probably needs to be this gameweek because Burnley at home, that's the money fixture. Havitz not as keen on this one compared to someone like Yokarez. I think Havz is still has some rotation risk particularly as he's just come back from injury. I think the first game in the double game week, I wouldn't be surprised to see Havz benched. Even though, you know, he's played pretty well in his time since returning from injury, not just in the Premier League, but in other competitions as well. But I think the risk there is just too high for me particularly as he might not even be playing as a striker. If Joz is in good form playing as the striker, is he going to be playing in midfield or is it going to be someone else? Erdigard or um or potentially I'm not exactly sure because obviously Erdigard has some injury issues too. So too much mystery, too much confusion, and the fact that he's a forward who probably won't play as a forward puts me off a little bit as well. Avoid Calbertt Lewen. Fixtures just are not good enough to buy him right now. Same with Bowen. And as always guys, we are going to put all Brenford players in the avoid section this week. That includes Dango. I know you guys will be looking at Dango this week. Um, I will definitely be talking about Brenford guys from gameweek 27 as potential buys, but you just don't buy players against Arsenal. It's like the cardinal sin of FPL. If a players are about to play Arsenal, you don't buy them. Doesn't mean you sell them, but you definitely don't buy them. Onto our midfielders. And guys, I'm actually genuinely going to put Bruno Fernandez ahead of Rice in the double gameweek. Even though yes, we have um technically we do have Rice with a double gameweek and Bruno uh with the non-double game week. I guess still, man, I it's just it's just Bruno is just so on it right now. He looks so good right now. He looks like such a good pick right now that he's so difficult to justify going without him. So much so that I think that Bruno in a single game week probably outscores Rice on a double gameweek. Maybe that's controversial, maybe it's not, but that's kind of how I feel about Bruno right now. Um maybe could have got even more in gameweek 25 to be honest. I mean, Shesho missed an enormous chance in the last second of the game, which would have been a Bruno assist. Um yeah, it's just looking too good with Bruno right now. And he's such a good captain every week as well. probably not in gameweek 26 because of the double game week and we will talk about um double gameweek captains and indeed triple captains in this week's video. So make sure you stay tuned for that one. Um but ultimately yeah Bruno is just essential right now. Can't say any more than that. Declan Rice is um also going to be a very obvious buy this week. You know if you're looking for a new midfielder you need a third Arsenal player. Rice is just so obvious. Good for Defcon. Still still on all those set pieces which is always going to be, you know, several routes to points as always. Taking long shots as well. Took a good long shot in game at 25. Could have been a goal. Wasn't on this occasion. And Florian Vertz is another player I like the look of. I'm not fully convinced by this Sunderland away fixture, but in general over the next kind of period of games, I really do like the idea of Berts. I did put him pretty low on the on last week's episode of of buy keeper void. I do kind of regret that. I am recording this video before the Man City game, but I do think that maybe Vertz could do well in that Man City game. I guess again, you guys might know by the time you've watched this how well Vertz does in that game. But regardless, as long as he doesn't get injured, he has got to be a player that we are keeping an eye on. And I I I probably did underrate him last game. Yeah, I guess that's just because our standard of midfielder is just so high right now. So yeah, definitely on the cards and I think the fact that Forest is looking like a slightly better fixture as well now I think has definitely improved the these uh Liverpool players in terms of our rankings. Palmer. Wow. Okay, we need to talk about him. 20 points in game mix 25. People will be clamoring over him understandably so. But let's just kind of maybe calm down a little bit because although he is a good buy because his ceiling is very high, there are some very obvious downsides to him as well. First of all, game week 25 where he did get his big return, it was two penalties. Like like any penalty taking player who has two penalties awarded to them in one game is going to look good in that one game. I mean people thinking about selling Eagle Thiago if he happen to get two penalties in one game, no one would be talking about it, would they? So it does maybe warp our perception a little bit on players. Now penalty takers are amazing to own. Of course they are. But, you know, I think it maybe looks like the gameweek 20 the gameweek uh score of 20 points was was obviously amazing, but it looks maybe a bit better than the performance was because it was two penalties if that makes sense. So, realistically, still very good, but maybe not as good as it looks, if that makes sense. We've also seen that Palmer is not fully fit. He's kind of come out in an interview and said, \"Yeah, I'm I'm just not fully fit right now essentially.\" And beyond gameweek 27, the fixtures are really rough for Chelsea. So, if you're looking for a high upside short-term differential, I guess, then yeah, Palmer could be your guy, but it is not without its risks and he is almost certainly a transfer back out from gameweek 28 onwards. Rogers is also going to be in this conversation. You could arguably put Rogers ahead of Palmer because Rogers is such a nice kind of medium-term hold all the way up until gameweek 31. Definitely would still be considering him, although his underlying data is maybe maybe leaves a little bit to be desired. At least he's taking plenty of shots. Sar is an really interesting pick. I'm curious to watch him today to see how he does. But Burnley and Wolves in the next two fixtures. If he's continuing to be the penalty taker, then we've got to like the look of this, haven't we? Getting plenty of chances to score big chances as well during his limited time since returning from AFCON. I think if you're looking for a cheap midfielder, he's probably where I'd be looking to go at this exact moment. Semeno is also going to be a monitor. There are is obviously some advantages of these nice fixtures coming up, but could there be rotation risk? Are you kind of walking yourself into a transfer out in gameweek 31? Yes, you probably are. But you could say the same thing about Ismile, who's also going to be blanking in gameweek 31 as well. I regret to inform you that Bruno G is going to be in the avoid section. I just it's so difficult to justify him as an FBL pick, although he is the penalty taker now apparently, especially in Gordon's absence. So, there's that. Um, but really outside of that, I think the fixtures are not really quite good enough. They're kind of average at best. I think Man City away and Manchester United at home are difficult fixtures and Spurs and Everton, I don't know, maybe somewhere in the middle probably slightly good fixtures, but maybe not amazing. So overall, um, yeah, when there are so many other midfielders performing right now who look genuinely good, whether that's just through penalties or, you know, from their overall play, I just don't really see how Bruno fits in when, you know, our standard is so high. The fixtures are not amazing here. the their the underlying data I don't think is is is incredible necessarily. And are you relying on penalties with him a little bit? I don't know. It's really difficult, guys. I'm going to have to put him in a void just cuz just by by virtue of there being better picks out there right now. But uh if you disagree, fair enough. Somerville, I think the fixtures are not again not good enough for West Ham going into these upcoming game weeks. So even though Somerville has been doing amazingly in such good form right now, just don't think this is the moment to buy him with Manchester United and Liverpool in the next three, Dardo would also look to avoid may have picked up an injury in gameweek 26 which um could limit his minutes uh sorry picked up an injury in gameweek 25 which could limit his minutes in gameweek 26. I think he's was already such a high-risk player, high-risisk pick. Don't think I'd go there. And defenders, pretty much Arsenal defenders. any of these guys, Gabrielle and Timber are your priority ones. But if you want to go for Celiba, I think that is also okay if you're maybe looking to go for a triple up or you can't quite afford uh some of the other guys. Um but Gabrielle, you know, I probably take a minus four to get Gabrielle in the team to be honest. Like he is so so crucial for this game week to be totally honest with you guys. Outside of that, Califuri, Hin Capier, other guys I think maybe a little too risky for me. So, it's really just these three Arsenal defenders I would be looking at. So, not so much Calif Fury to be honest. You're going to have to be a real risk taker to go there and just not comfortable recommending that in a video like today. James Hill, the new cheat code of FPL. Great fixtures coming up 3.9 million and has actually been one of the best defconers of recent gameweeks as well. 70 defensive contribution points. only one player and that's a strike at uh or stra at Leads uh is the only player to get more defcons than Hill in the last six game weeks which is crazy crazy stuff. So second best in that regard um and the fixtures are good and he's cheap. Yeah, I think Bournemouth are improving defensively as well. Their numbers are trending um towards a in a positive direction. I think this is a good pick even better than Sessi potentially. I don't know if you are factoring in value for money, I think Hill is a better pick than Senessi, but both good because the fixtures are just good for Bournemouth, particularly from a defensive point of view. Um, I think Crystal Palace fixtures are are good from a defensive point of view as well, particularly in the next two. And I would be hoping for some clean sheets here, despite Crystal Palace's poor uh recent form. Rich is the defcon guy, but if you're willing to spend a little bit more money, 5.8 million mono is going to be uh definitely an interesting option to go for as well. But I think Riches at 4.4 4 million because he is so uh cheap because he is safe getting regular defensive contributions. He's maybe the more sensible of the two picks. Dalow is also going to be in the monitor section. You could go for him potentially. The fixes are pretty decent here for him. Um but defensive contributions just don't really happen for him. Pretty rare. Um maybe do have some attacking threat there. Um but yeah, he's kind of an interesting one. Not really my kind of defender, but I I kind of I I see the vision in him. I see the vision. Would definitely look to avoid Kuka. know defcon 6 million so really expensive and really I don't even know if leads at home is a great fixture for a defender leads score goals man they really really do um Burnley after that is is you know very good for Kuka but after that fixture is terrible so I think if you're looking to buy Chelsea defenders you've probably left it a little bit too late at this point you should have done it before and actually from here on there are players that are you know just as good over the next two game weeks and beyond that much much better Mark Gayhee if you haven't already got him don't think I'd be looking to buy him now necessarily and Mukle not the greatest week to buy him ahead of that Liverpool fixture. And let's wrap up with some goalkeepers guys. Um yeah, obviously you're going to keep Rya ahead of the double game week in 26. Got a bonus point in gameweek 25 which was really nice. Couple of saves there for him as well. Um if you got Sanchez would also be looking to keep him for the next two game weeks and then we can kind of reassess at that point. If you're looking to sell a goalkeeper, maybe Pigford is the only goalkeeper I maybe be looking to sell just because Everton just seem to be, you know, getting worse defensively, which is a little worrying there. Um, but, you know, even that, I mean, I'm never convinced by any goalkeeper transfers to be honest, unless it's a player like Cells who is kind of injured right now or a player who is like not playing regularly. If you're looking to buy a new goalkeeper, Rya is a really obvious one. I still believe Rya is, you know, the best goalkeeper pick in the game. um which is kind of backed up by um all of the clean sheets and it's the double game week right now is just a good time to jump on if you haven't if you're looking for a new goalkeeper right now you haven't got your triple Arsenal sorted maybe the way to get your triple Arsenal it's just just go very simple go for David Rya um we got Jose Sa maybe as a potential alternative here as well again I'm not too super convinced by this one but I think you could definitely potentially go for Jose S because of the uh just the fact that um you know going to get a double game week. I think some of the fixtures are okay. I think he is playable in some fixtures. Maybe could work as as a rotation goalkeeper at 4.2 million. Maybe you could hide him on your bench in gameweek 31. Um because he's obviously a goalkeeper. If your other goalkeeper does have a fixture in gameweek 31, like even if it's Dravka, then you know maybe that could work that way as well. Um Wolves are improving defensively. I know they conceded, you know, a whole bunch of goals against Chelsea, but you know, penalties are going to make score lines look a lot worse. And then for avoid, don't think I would be buying Sanchez at this point and Pigford I definitely wouldn't be buying at this point in the season. But that's pretty much all the players we've got today. We covered so much. But as always guys, there's always more players that we miss because we can't talk about every player in the Premier League. So if there's any player I didn't mention in today's video, let me know in the comments section and we'll give them a rating, a buy, sell, keep, or avoid. And I'll try and give some justification in some of the comments as well. So let me know in the replies guys. Drop a like guys. Do subscribe. We are got to be locking in because the new deadline is upon us so so soon. So plenty of videos to come this week guys. Looking forward to sharing them with you and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye."

[music] >> [music] >> Hello. There's there's a a square on my face right now, apparently. Um, hang on. I'm just tweeting out the stream. Uh, gameweek 25. Game 25, right? Gameweek 25. Okay. Hello. Hello. Let's remove this square from my face. We don't need this. We don't need this. Hello everyone. How are we all today? I hope you're all well. It is gameweek 25 deadline day and a Friday deadline, no less. So, I hope you guys have not told your your colleagues, your mini league rivals, your friends about this uh this Friday deadline in hopes that they will forget. What shirt is this? Well, this, my friend, is a Costa Rica special. Um, it was going to be the Costa Rica um World Cup shirt for this year. Um, but yeah, that's what uh that's what we're we're rocking today. Always rocking a new shirt. It's got to it's got to be done. The jersey collection continues to spiral really out of control. I mean, it it's not they're not just on the rail anymore. I mean, I'm not going to show this part of the room because it's a mess, but it's just piles and piles of football shirts at this point. Really quite crazy. There there is organization to to the madness, though. Uh, there really is. Um, but regardless, hello everyone. Hello everyone. Um, I need to make a transfer today. I don't know about you guys, um, but I've not quite locked in my transfers, but um, that will be done in today's stream. What's my favorite shirt? It's got to be that one. There's got to that's got to be my favorite shirt. That's why it's there, to be honest. That's why it's there to be honest. Um, but yeah, let me uh let me catch you guys up on where I am at in terms of my team. Uh just find the tab and get that correct and zoom out a little bit so it's clear as day. Okay. Right. This, my friends, is where we're at. Well, as you'll see in a second. There we go. Right. So, haven't made the sack transfer yet. He will be going for Declan Rice. Declan Rice will be uh will be coming in and uh that will be me done because I only have one free transfer. So, I'm not going to go too crazy with it this week as there's not really much point. Um and I'm pretty happy to just go fairly straightforward this week. Uh Kong with a super chat nice and early in the stream today. Morning Dan. Thoughts on Gabrielle Captain? Um I think he's probably my second favorite after Bruno. I think there's like for me Bruno is my favorite captain and I kind of have three second favorites but maybe there's a little bit of a gap there. Uh and the three second favorites are probably Gabrielle, Ecat, and Bowen. I'd maybe maybe throw in and Burmo there as well. Um so yeah, something like that. Something like that is is probably what I would do. Um, if I'm looking for an alternative captain, which includes Gabrielle, but honestly, if you have Bruno, is it the week to be silly? Is it the week to go differential? I don't know. I don't know. I'm not thinking about Palmer. No, I'm not, Reesei. I'm not thinking about Palmer really. Uh, still still just not totally convinced by his minutes or indeed his performances. I don't I know people said like the other week he got two assists, but I watched that game. The two assists were like pass to a teammate and they run all the way down the field and score from 40 yards. It's like sideway sideways pass for the uh the striker to score a wonder goal. So, I don't know. Uh I'm just not really seeing the vision with Palmer at the moment. His form has just not been there. And to be honest, I'm probably one of the people who really really I'm I'm not buying the hype on Chelsea players this week. I mean, I'm I'm an Enzo owner, and honestly, once Rice is in this midfield, I'm probably expecting Enzo to probably score the least amount of points of any of my attackers because Wolves away, I just don't think this is an amazing fixture for anyone, you know, let alone a Chelsea team that's just played kind of midweek and played loads of games recently. Um, so I don't know, man. I don't know. FBL Joe says, \"People saw a green F mob score on Palmer in that game and assumed 2024 Palmer was back.\" This is what I'm saying. It's um it's nostalgia, isn't it? It's a little bit nostalgia. Palmer's just not in the right moment. He needs to have his surgery probably will happen after the World Cup and then um hopefully he can get back to his best, but for for right now, you know, we're talking about Sacka being bad, but for money, Palmer is just another sacker as far as I'm concerned. I don't really want to get trapped there. Um, and I don't think Wolves Wolves have really improved defensively. Like, look through the recent Wolves games and we'll just show you. We'll just show you the recent Wolves results. Actually, should we just go on FOMO? Let's do mob. Speaking of FOMO, um, so they're not actually really conceding that many goals and indeed that many chances either. So, we can go through their some of their form. Just go back a page. It's going to take us all the way back. All right. So, um, let's, uh, let's look pretty. So, two goals conceded to Bournemouth, two to Man City. Not too surprising. They're two good attacks. Um, nil nil against Newcastle. Uh, one goal conceded to Everton, none to West Ham, one to Manchester United, two to Liverpool, two to Brenford, two to Arsenal. It's not really since the 8th of December, which is two months ago, that Wolves have actually got battered by anyone. Like, I'm not saying they're a good team. like they're not. But like I think a lot of people look at Wolves at the bottom bottom of the table and and think, \"Oh, this Wolves side is um we got Opter as well. Um they look at this Wolves side at the bottom of the table and assume like this is the best fixture a team can possibly have right now.\" And it's just not. I think there are several teams I'd rather play as an attacker right now than Wolves. Um, let's just go 10 gameweek data on defensive defensive fantasy football hub. We'll zoom in a little bit. Um, and kind of look at the non penalty expected goals uh allowed non- penalty goals against Wolvesa here 12.3. Um, so basically conceding just over one xG non-penalty per game. It's look, I'm not saying this is a bad fixture, but it's it's not a bad fixture. It's a good fixture, but it's not Burnley. Uh I think Burnley or worse. I think Bournemouth for worse. I I think I'd rather play, you know, Bulham at home would be a better fixture than Wolves away. Everton at home would be a better fixture than Wolves away. Sunland at home is a better fixture than Wolves away. Crystal Palace at home is better than uh Wolves away. Brighton home or away is better. West Ham home or away is probably better. Leads home or away is probably better. So, I think it's an okay fixture, but is it so good that you know, like I'm seeing people go, \"Okay, we need to get Palmer. We need to get Joel Pedro. This is this is Wolves. This is an amazing fixture.\" Is it is it It's all right. It's all right. But Joel Pedro captain like I I honestly I think the only reason we're seeing Hang on this picture a picture of Jal Pedro being brought in by over 700,000 managers. This will hit 750,000 by the time we get to deadline easy. Maybe even 800. Um, the only reason we're seeing so many people brought by Jah Pedro, I mean obviously because he scored points recently, that always helps, but because people see Wolves as the bottom of the table and say that is the fixture I want. I would be more inclined to captain a Chelsea player against, you know, Leicester, oh sorry, Leadeds and Burnley. Not that you not that you probably will because obviously 26 is a double, but um it's it's an okay game. Like I'm not I don't have the same, you know, FOMO on Jal Pedro as a lot of other people seem to have. Like so many, you know, looking through YouTube comments and stuff like that, a lot of people seem really, really keen to get Jo Pedro in kind of at any cost. And I just don't see the vision. Like I think Ecat is a better pick this week than e than uh than Pedro for example. Um I think over the over the medium term I think Thiago is a better pick than than Juel Pedro and the odds kind of reflect that as well. Um so these are the bookmaker odds. Rob T um posted these yesterday and you know Shah Pedro he is there. He's in the conversation. 0.38 projected goals there. But like we've got Eatique, Raal, Watkins, Thiago, Evan Nilson, you know, if we're just looking at forwards, Whistard, Calbertt Leuen, Harland, Yokarez, all of these players are, you know, have better odds this week. And I don't think that will be the same next week. I think Sha Pedro will have better goalcoring odds in gameweek 26. But then maybe you say, okay, midweek, gameweek, is there some rotation risk? Maybe, maybe not. Um, you know, can he still do some damage off the bench? Absolutely. Um, gameweek 27 against Burnley. Amazing for Jo Pedro. Really like that as well. But this week, eh, oh, sorry, bang my uh my mic. Um, yeah, it's like, yeah, he's all right. He's an okay pick. Not going to break I'm not going to break my team for him. Certainly not going to captain him. Probably wouldn't even make my top 10 captains this week to be honest. Thumbnail says gameweek 24. Oh, does it? Well, then that's that's uh unintentional. Wait, did I not make a new thumbnail? I thought I did. Thank you for that. That is actually useful. Uh oh, yeah, I'm using last week's thumbnail for some reason. Let me resolve that because um that is incorrect. Thank you for flagging that Farath. We're meant to have a nice Bruno Fernandez on the thumbnail as well, not Joel Pedro. Speaking of Hey, maybe it was uh written in the stars there a little bit to talk about Joel Pedro. Will Harland start? Uh yeah, I don't see why he wouldn't. I don't see why he wouldn't. I mean, it's like a pretty big game for Man City, a must-win game. Every game's a must-win game, but um you know, it's it's a it's an enormous game for uh for Manchester City, and I just cannot see them not playing their best striker. And and I appreciate Marmush been in good form. Maybe there is a way to play both of those guys, but nah, surely let's be let's be real. I don't see a reason why Harland would be benched any more so than anyone else. Like anyone could be benched in any game. You just don't know. But Pep said he don't doesn't know if Harland will start. Has Pep ever known if any of his players will start? Be interested to find the exact quote. Uh what a Pep Guardiola press. Actually, we'll find it on X, can't we? Um, what's that Man City Extra? So, what have they said? Uh, Anton Semeno stuff. What's the exact quote here? Lots of Anton Cherokee. Mark Gay. By the way, even Mark Gayhee, I think, is at some risk because Ruben Dash is back now and John Stones is back in training. So, Mark Gay probably good for now, but you know, you never know when that rotation could begin. The only quote I saw on Harland earlier was that Pep said like something like, \"Oh, he's the best striker in the world.\" Or something like that. Uh, okay. So, he said he doesn't know if Bernardo is available. I can't see anything about Harland here. Uh, yeah. Oh, here we go. Whether Harland automatically starts um Erling is the best strike in the world. I don't know. We'll decide tomorrow. Always I say Erling is the best. Okay. Yeah, that's kind of what I saw. That doesn't really suggest to me that he doesn't know if Harland is available or anything like that. It's just like I haven't picked my lineup yet. I'm not telling you my lineup. So, uh yeah, that's all that that says to me. Yeah, Harland stars like just as likely as as any other player. Not something I'm worried about. Uh should I start Lewis Potter? I mean, yeah, you you could definitely uh play Lewis Potter. I think he could be interesting this week. Could be really interesting. Any update on Watkins? Yes. Yes. Actually, um he's going to be in the squad apparently. Whether that means he's going to start or not is maybe a slightly different question, but it's looking positive. It's looking fairly optimistic on on Watkins and his availability. So, um yeah, I guess uh positive. Don't think I'd be selling necessarily. Uh should I sell Harland? No, I mean I I will answer all Harland related questions at once. Don't sell him, but don't captain him either. Like I know people will want to sell him anyway. And if you really want to sell Harland, who am I to stop you? Who am I to stop you? But it's not something that is even remotely entering my mind um at all. Like particularly if you're selling Sacka, like you've just freed up a whole bunch of money by selling Sacka. Do you really need to free up even more money by selling Harland? What are you even going to spend that money on? Like as bad as you think Harland might be, he's not he's no worse than I don't know, whoever you would replace him with. He's, you know, he's better than Joel Pedro. is better than Thiago right now. I don't know. Eat Salah. I mean, you could do you could sell Harland to get Salah in, but I I feel like the other the other kind of meta point is and Harland and and Salah, I don't really see there being too much difference in their form, particularly right now. Um, there's far more midfielders to go for right now than there are forwards. Like I'm bringing in Rice this week and I'm thinking, \"Oh man, how am I going to get in Verts? How am I going to get in Rogers? How am I get going to get in Wilson? Um maybe Dango at Brenford in a couple of weeks, too.\" I'm looking at so many different midfielders and I only have five slots and I'm thinking, man, this is frustrating. Um so how are you going to fit in Salah in there as well? I have no idea. I have no idea. And then you got players like Anderson and Enzo who are performing well at a cheap price. Got cheap defenders doing very well. Where are you going to spend the money? Bruno G starts. Um I don't know. Uh he's looking reasonably positive. He has been in training and I think because Lewis Miley is unavailable, I think that does improve Bruno G's chances. So, I will say maybe a cautious maybe a cautious yes. Maybe. Um, yes, comedy addict. We did already discuss it. I'm sure we'll talk about it again later. But what do I think of Pep's comments on Harland? I feel absolutely nothing. I am reading absolutely nothing into it whatsoever. All we could gather from that is that Pep doesn't know. Well, Prep is unwilling to reveal what his starting lineup is going to be, and he's undecided, and he's going to decide tomorrow because the game is on Sunday. So, why would he have decided his lineup today 100%. He of course he hasn't. So, he all the Pep has done is state the obvious and refuse to reveal who he's starting uh on Sunday. And why would he give up that that tactical advantage? Why would he imagine giving a definitive answer on whether Erling Harland will start or not? two days before a game of football against Liverpool when Liverpool would have all you know all ways to prepare in uh in different ways for the game depending on whether if they had definitive information of whether Harland is or isn't starting would would be ridiculous for Pep Guardiola to answer in any other way than the way in which he did answer. It would be ridiculous. So, uh yeah, no read into it whatsoever. None. [laughter] None at all. Um, what we got here in the chat then? Um, I went sack to Rogers comments. Uh, yeah, it's fine. It's fine. Rogers maybe not in the best form right now, but I think that can pick up soon. I think that could pick up soon. Wild card draft. Uh, the best wild the best thing to do about wild card is probably not wild card. >> [snorts] >> Yeah, Jamie's just sold Rogers for Enzo. Yeah, lot of people selling Rogers actually. I saw that. Like most transfers out for this round. Rogers is in. What's that? One, two, three, four, five, six. I think there's going to be a lot of regret for some players here. Thiago. I'm I want people to keep selling Thiago because I want his price to keep dropping so I can buy him in 27 or 28 because I am going to be buying Thiago and I'm going to enjoy owning Thiago as well. Um, so people want to keep selling him, go for it. Reduce his ownership, reduce his price. We will enjoy it. Bowden makes sense. I think Sacka makes sense. I think Bruno G makes sense to sell. Watkins, you know, kind of on the fence on that one. Rogers, I don't get get him as as a cell. These are good fixtures. Bournemouth, Brighton, leads, Wolves, Chelsea at home is decent. Man United is tough. West Ham at home is nice. So, there's lots of really nice fixtures here all the way up until like you can argue to save for the end of the season really. Um, so yeah, I think that I think there will be some Thiago selling regrets unless people buy him back in after, of course. I think there'll be some Rogers selling regrets. I think there'll be some Harland selling regret. Um, it's not the worst week for Calbertt Lew either at home against Forest. You could do worse. And Declan Rice being sold. I mean, I've been keeping an eye. The reason I haven't made an early transfer this game week is because there's just been absolutely no risk of Declan Rice rising in price because people see his blanks recently and assume that he's terrible. Now, Jeremy says, \"I loved Rogers at 5.5 million.\" I loved him at 5 million, man. Crazy. What a crazy buy he was. Is DCL a buy or a sell? It's neither. He's a don't buy, don't sell. If you have him, keep him. If you don't have him, don't buy him. Strand Lson going to start? That's a good question. I I really I'm I'm struggling to answer that one. I it's a it's a it's a coin toss situation I think. Should I buy Timber? I I I would feel reasonably confident on Timber. I I have seen a few questions regarding Timber. So the latest on Yuran Timber is that he has indeed uh been out of training this week. So he didn't train on was it Thursday? Wednesday or Thursday? He didn't train. Um and presumably that is just load management because apparently there's no injury there or anything like that. So there's no injury problem with uh with Pedro which is pos with jurian timber. So yeah, um I think it should be I think it should be fine uh to well it's certainly fine to start him if you're still a little bit worried and I think there is every chance that there is a rotation a resting for Timber this game week. Yeah, there's a small chance um a chance that is large enough to take note of, but it's far more likely that he he starts than doesn't start, I think, still. So, I'm not worried about Timbers's minutes necessarily. But I think if you're trying to look for a tiebreaker of whether you should buy Timber or or or Rice, if it's a head-to-head between Timber and Rice, who you're going to buy, maybe that can be a tiebreaker. But yeah, maybe that depends on your team structure and other things. What are your thoughts on Chucky? Um, I mean, you would you probably wouldn't want him for this game week against Liverpool. Uh, there's going to be some rotation risk with a midweek gameweek as well. I think I'd probably be looking to towards selling him if I had him just because I don't think he's worth the trouble. Why does no one talk about Celiba? um because he doesn't really do anything. He doesn't get defensive contributions. He doesn't take shots. He has no uh creativity. He's, you know, kind of capped. He doesn't get bonus points either. He's kind of capped at six points. So, you know, just go for Rya. Just go for Rya. There's so many great defcon defenders who are cheap or or you know goalc scoring defenders as well, bonus point magnets defenders that using one of your defender slots on Civa I don't know I don't know if you're going to triple up on the Arsenal defense I think the best way to do that is Rya Gabrielle Timber most likely because at least Timber does have some attacking threat and that may have not been reflected in the points But um you know when you watch the games you can see Timber is and and looking at the data as well. Timber's got some uh attacking online data whereas um it's just non-existent for um for I'll show you. So let's go Arsenal defenders. We'll go full season. How many shots has each defender taken? So, in 20 games this season, Celiba has taken three shots. That is monstrously low. He's got He's taken three shots. He's got defensive contribution points once [snorts] and he's picked up four bonus points total. So, he's a sixpoint merchant. He really is. So yeah, if you think Califuri is is maybe a little risky for me, it's Timber and Gabrielle really. These are the these are the defenders we're looking at. Timber shooting shooting numbers here is pretty good throughout the season. Uh and his key passing numbers are good as well. Oh, I say good. They're okay. They're okay. Free hit team. Oh, if you if you've got your free hit active right now, don't do do not confirm it. Cancel it. However bad you think your team might be this week, um surely it's not worth a free hit here. Should we talk about some chips for a second here? Scott says he's due a fourth shot. Yeah, quite possibly is due a fourth shot. So, what's that? That's one shot every like eight games, something like that. Seven get seven, eight games. That's That's wild. Uh Lisa Sn with the uh super chat here. Timber in, Collins out. Got Gabrielle and Rice. I mean, yeah, Collins could depend potentially go. It depends what your other defenders are. The one thing about Collins that is worth noting. I do have Collins in my squad is that he does look pretty good from gameweek 27, 28 onwards. So, Brian at home, very playable. Burnley away. You got to play him. um argument to play him against Bournemouth because I think that's a good defcon game. You're going to play him against Wolves, possibly going to play him against leads. If you wild carding in 32, maybe that is more motivation to sell because some of his better games are after gameweek 32. But really, I think if you can hold off two weeks, there's a lot of very playable games for Collins. So, it depends if you need uh if you need something now or you need something kind of soon, I guess. Is Virgil a good pick? He's not great for this game week, I guess. But, uh I would be happy to to start him, I guess. Do we get reason why he was benched on the bench last week? Yes, we did, Scott. We did. So, basically, Collins had like a minor um training ground cut. He got he picked up a cut in in training, I believe, and he needed stitches. Um, and just because they didn't really want to disrupt the stitches too much, um, they put him on the bench and kind of went, you know, we want your stitches to heal. We'll throw you on the pitch only if we desperately need you. And with with 10 men and and uh and only one goal up, they ended up needing Collins to to sub him on off off the bench. But yeah, they were they were making an effort to not play Collins in that game because of his stitches. But yeah, just a minor thing. You know, anyone who's had stitches before um will know that, you know, you need to kind of limit your movement for a couple of days maybe and then after that you're pretty much fine. So, um no concern really about um future minutes as far as Collins is concerned. just one of those things. Just one of those unfortunate things that can happen and a minor unfortunate thing as well. So, no biggie, no big deal. So, I think he's fine to keep um in that in that sense and and in the sense that the fixtures look good soon, too. And he's really good for Defcon. One of the best Defcon defenders in the league. I think he's going to be a handy pick. A very handy pick. Should we do a captain poll? I want to get an early idea on what you guys are thinking about captain. Um, comedy addict here says, \"Damn, mate. Did you see Gordon go down holding his left leg and then limp limp off holding his right?\" Oh, no. I didn't see that. I assumed it was a an actual injury. He is injured, isn't he? He's got a It's a hamstring issue, isn't it? Did see the press conference notes earlier. Right. Okay. We're going to do a captain poll. I'm not sure who to put in the poll. So, what I want you guys to do is just type in the chat who you're captaining and I'll get an idea from that who are the most popular captains and we'll throw the most popular ones in a poll and then you guys can get to vote in. So guys, if you would mind throw in the chat who you're captaining this week. So, who we got? We've got Bruno Fernandez, of course. Uh, I haven't seen Harland Joel Pedro maybe. Seems mostly Bruno. Might be a landslide. This one. Har and Joel Pedro I'm seeing. And Gabrielle, unless anyone else pops up. Uh, someone's saying Rice. I'm not really seeing the vision on that one. Once one, a couple of people said in Burmo, Bruno has one. Oh, yeah. Oh, Bruno has won this poll without a shadow of a doubt. But I am interested to see who comes second. Um, right. So, I put I put the question the poll question is going to be who is the best gameweek 26 captain and just pick out of the options. If you think it's someone else, fair enough. Just pick your favorite out of these four. We can talk on and on and on about differential captains, but um I don't think we really need to Martinelli because he looks like Dan. It's been a while since anyone said I look like Martinelli to be fair. It's been a little while. Um, okay. But there we go. Polls in the chat now. If you guys want to vote and we'll we probably know Bruno's one. Uh, I'm curious to see how many of you guys are going different and if so, where are you going different? That's that's uh the big big question. Hello here for FPL. Welcome versus Dravka. I think I probably backfa sorry uh like trying to think realistically this week who would I actually bench for Dravka out of the main goalkeepers. Maybe this is a job for the bench list. I did want to save the bench list. I try and I do try and save the bench list as late as possible. Um but it would seem that um let's just get let's just let's set up a little set up a little um for us there. Right. Who would I not start this week? Okay. I'm just You know what? I'm going to leave this for now. I'm just going to do goalkeepers. Let's throw on screen. So, let's just do goalkeepers for now and we'll try and figure out who would we actually bench ahead of. I I can't see a world in which um West Ham don't score. So I'm not expecting a clean sheet in this game for Nebraska. So let's think about this logically. Obviously you're going to play Rya. So we can put Rya at the top. Then you're going to play you're going to play Vugan. I think Crystal Palace is just it's a good fixture. You're going to play Pigford. Sorry, Sanchez and Pigford. Actually, you're going to play Sanchez. You're going to play Pigford. Are you going to play Kellah? That's where it gets a little questionable. That's close. Petravvic Petravich is maybe where it goes the other way. Um, does anyone have Donnaruma? Donnaruma, you probably bench this week. Super chat here from Taster or Tyster says, \"Hi Dan, one pick for Tera Lefeta Anderson or two Nunez.\" Nunez Darwin Nunez. Oh, right. Man City Nunes, Nunes to Timber, Lefay to Anderson or three Pigford to Rya, Nunz to Hill, Lefay to Kuna. I don't think we need to make a triple transfer here. Um, the most sensible one is probably Nunes to Timber Lefto Anderson because that way you're you're not adding a game 31 Blanca cuz Pigford is nice cuz you know Pigford's perfectly playable in gaming 31. Although if you have to brava backup goalkeeper is pretty fine as well. Um yeah, I think I would probably lean towards number two. Although there's definitely an argument to say that number one is the safer bet, but I think I'd do number two out of those. Yeah, let's go with two. Cool. All right. Um other goalkeepers on here, you want Pope, you want Ruffs. So Ruffs goes to the bottom. There's no doubt about that. you're not you're not going to want to play roofs or any indeed any Sunderland player this week really. Um and then Lammonds was the other one I saw mentioned in the chat. We got Pford on there already. Lmons I think is maybe a little bit better than some of these guys. Probably better than Kalaha. So like that. H. Is that all of the goalkeepers you guys have? Surely no one has any others. Who Who is even missing from this list? Leno. If you have Leno, I'd play him this week. Probably above everyone other than Rya. Um, uh, I don't know. I don't know where I'd go. Um, Pope. Oh, Pope. People have Pope. Yeah. Okay. Pope is a maybe somewhat questionable, but I think again you Let's put him between Twix Lammons and Kellaher. I'd be happy with that. Picario. People do not have Picario in their FPL teams. I refuse to believe that. You're having me on. You're absolutely having me on. All right. Well, we'll leave that then for now because I did say I do want to save the bench list. I do want to save the bench list until a little later on in the stream. Um, so give me give us 20 minutes. We'll talk about some other stuff and then we'll be then we'll be back and we'll we'll fill up the other side of the bench list. But for now, I think for goalkeeper wise, I think I'm reasonably happy with that as a as a priority order. That looks good to me. Yeah, happy days. Cool. Right. Um, let's talk a little bit about fixtures, guys. And this is my my fixture calendar. Is that visible? It's fairly visible. Okay. Let's try and get it to fit on screen nicely for you guys. So this is on uh Google Sheets. Those of you guys who are members of the channel at the starting 11 tier or above, you will have access to this uh calendar and I will continue to update it as I see things changing. Um but I want to show you the the I want to give you the lowdown. In fact, I'm going to open it on here because I did tweet it as well. Open image in new tab so I'm not messing around with the cells and stuff. Okay, that's pretty nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. That pretty much fits in perfectly on screen as well. Cool. All right, so we have the double gameweek in 26. We all are we all clear on that by now? Hopefully we are. Blank gameweek 31. So Arsenal are going to blank. Wolves are going to blank. and Crystal Palace and Man City might blank. Probably will blank. 90 95% chance will blank. There is still a chance that we see Man City and Crystal Palace still take part within gameweek 31. It would require Man City to be knocked out of the FA Cup. That's pretty much the only way that's going to happen. Unless also Man City get knocked out of the round of 16 in the Champions League. Again, don't know how likely that is. So, it's pretty unlikely that the fixture will be rescheduled in there because not only did, you know, City have to be knocked out of other competitions and then the Premier League also need to decide we're going to move it there. So, it requires two things to happen. So, I don't think that's going to happen, but it could. We could see that fixture go back in. Then after that, we have double game week 33, which um it's going to be it's going to be interesting. Um, currently the most likely teams to double in 33 are going to be Crystal Palace and Man City because they have multiple ways in which they could double in 33, but um really it's anyone's game really. I mean, even I I've put Burnley and Liverpool as kind of unlikely to double in 33 at present, but that could also change. Um, so they're probably the least Burnley and Liverpool probably the least likely teams to double in 33 right now. Um, still they do have every chance as does everyone else. So, can't really narrow this down too much at the moment, but what we do have here is is an idea of if these teams were to get a double game week, what those double gameweek fixtures would be, I guess. So, for example, if you want to go to Arsenal, if Arsenal were to have a double game week in 33, what would their double game week look like? Well, it would be New It would be Man City away and it would be Newcastle home, which is a pretty rubbish double if we're totally honest. It's not ideal. I guess Arsenal you know they can do anything. Um if Aston Villa were to get a double a little bit nicer Sunderland at home for them away. If Brenford or to get a double it would be Fulham Man United etc etc etc. The nicest looking potential doubles are Forest who have a potential of Burnley and Sunderland which could be really nice. Like I feel like if we're looking for some double gameweek players around there and if Forest were to get a double, I think players like Nico Williams, maybe Mario going to be on the cards. Probably Nico Williams. He's pretty cheap now, right? Um Spurs have a would have a pretty decent double there. Brighton Wolves, West Ham would have Chris Pal and Everton. Um Lees would have a decent double. It's kind of unfortunate that some of the bigger teams wouldn't have the best of doubles. That is the only unfortunate thing. Chelsea, Man United at home, Brighton away. It's okay. Jeremy says, \"I might get Rogers.\" If Villa has that double. Yeah. I mean, if if if Villa get that double, then Rogers is going to be very much on the cards, isn't it? Very much on the cards. Yeah. I I think there are a lot of cheaper players who might have good double game weeks more so than the expensive players, but it's going to be interesting. It's going to be interesting. And then double gameweek 36. The currently the most likely teams to get that double in my opinion are Burnley, Liverpool, Crystal Palace, and Man City. Those teams, I think, are the most likely to get a double game 36 at this point. And that's what they kind of could potentially look like. Now this 36 Brenford at home, Burnley away. That's for Man City by the way. That is genuine triple captain territory. So whilst everyone is talking about Arsenal Gabrielle triple captain 26 against Brenford and Wolves, I like it. I love it. In fact, just be aware that we are potentially looking at Harland against Brenford and Burnley as a double gameweek in gameweek 36. Now the question mark there is, you know, is Harland going to be in form at that time? Is Harlem going to be regularly starting if City are you know prioritizing other competitions? Are you know what's going to what is going to be the situation there? Are City going to be in other competitions or is Harland going to be um you know maybe nailed on for Premier League games? We don't know. It's so far in the future. Is Harland even going to be fit? He could get injured before then and then at that point who you triple captaining mammoosh maybe. Um, so there's a whole bunch of uh question marks around game 36. It's not just whether that double game will happen, but also what is uh what is the the chances that Harland is going to be a good captain, let alone triple captain at that moment. We don't know. We don't know. So, uh yeah, it's kind of a stick or twist situation. That's the information there and I wanted to wanted to share that with those you guys who are interested in that kind of stuff. I know I am. But uh most people just want to know who to bench. I don't care what's happening in gameweek 36. Dan, just tell me who to bench and shut up. Right, Sam L with the super chat here. Thank you so much, Sam. Um and Sam says, \"Don't know whether to do Kalahar to Rya or O'Reilly to Timber. All this doubt regarding Timber has put me off. Currently have Rice and Gabrielle.\" Um, well, I mean, I think you're you're certainly along the right the right lines if you're looking between those two players. Uh, or two transfers maybe. I like O'Reilly to Timber more. I think I think I think if that's my team, I'm doing O'Reilly to Timber because Callah is fine. Um, he's a fine pick and he is for some time now. Um, O'Reilly is a kind of a problem area in your team anyway. So by doing the O'Reilly to timber move, you're addressing a problem you already have in your team rather than just making a a kind of a sideways move in many ways. So yeah, O'Reilly to Timber is what I would do because you deal with an O'Reilly issue. And I know, you know, there's some doubt regarding Timber. There's a there's a little bit of doubt from everything I've been informed about. Timber isn't like injured. He's not injured. Um there may be some load management. Maybe that extends into the gameweek 20 25. But e but even if Timber misses gameweek 25, I would feel confident that he starts both games in gameweek 26 because of that gap between the two fixtures. And again, I tweeted this out as well the other day. Um so you can get a good idea of what the double game week actually looks like in kind of practice. Um, so this weekend we're going to have Arsenal against Sunderland. Then in the midweek we're going to see Arsenal versus Brenford. And then at the weekend, so this is not this weekend, but next weekend we're going to see Arsenal versus Wigan. And then a couple of days after that, in the midweek again, we're going to see Arsenal versus Wolves. So there is a full week between Brenford and Wolves. And I think if Timber is getting rested, rotated, whatever you want to call it, it's going to happen in gameweek 26. Now it could also happen in gameweek 25. I think that's less likely but still possible. But I would be really eyeing up particularly, you know, he's played midweek against Chelsea. He's played loads of games in a row. Gameweek 25 maybe makes some sense to to bench him, rest him, rotate him, Timber, but for game 26, I cannot really see a reason to not play him. And I think he plays 27 as well for the record against Spurs. So 25 is summed out the midweek in the FA Cup. I would be very surprised to see him play. But the double game week, I think Timber looks genuinely good. I think he looks genuinely good. Why do you still have Sakar in? Because I haven't made my transfer yet. They're pretty uh straightforward. I' I've not needed to make a transfer because there haven't been any price changes that have kind of impacted me. Um so I haven't made the move. But I will and I shall. And maybe I should just do that now to uh to avoid any questions because I'm doing it. I'm I'm I'm kind of fully committed at this point because I figured out plans and stuff. So, let's lock this in. There we go, guys. Live transfer live and direct. Rice coming in for Saka at long last. I'm going to confirm that. And this is how I'm looking for gameweek 25, which I think is pretty strong. Actually, I'm reasonably happy with this team. I think the biggest question marks for me are going to be Hill and Chia, but they're playing at home. I think they got good chance of of Defcon, each of them. They're good games to get Defcon in. Um, so we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. But team looks strong. Team looks nice. Migusta. There we have it. Um, would you bench boost now if all four on the bench have an easy fixture or wait until double game week? I would I would wait till double game week to bench boost. I think the big thing about the the bench boost this season and why it's so is you know in my opinion going to be so powerful um is is defcon essentially. So, you're going to have players like Sessi or or indeed Hill or Richards or um Anderson, you know, if any of these kind of cheap defenders who are typically on your bench have double game weeks, even if they don't get any clean sheets and they just get defcon in both games, a bench boost on a cheap defender on a double game week, a cheap defcon defender could be eight points per defender without doing anything. So, say you've got two defenders on your bench. Both of them get defcon in, you know, all of their games. So, two defcons for each. No clean sheets, only one goals conceded each or something like that. That's 16 points on your bench boost from two players already. And that's without a single return. So, um that's what I would say there. Da da da da da da da says, \"Should answer as many questions as possible, mate. I could do I could answer as many questions as possible, but it would mean that there's not very much detail going into the answers of many questions.\" I mean, we could try that if you want. We could try it. Okay. Well, let's do it. I'm going to scroll through and we're going to answer as many questions as possible and we'll we'll see if this makes for good content. I'm willing to try it. Thiago Ekatik Ecat why do you have him buro because I like him Enzo or S start Riches or Keen uh Keen should I keep Semeno and Mark change to Joel Pedro and Paul don't know Riches or Chiao as my third defender don't know maybe Riches someone please help me to play out of these three uh question too long to answer quickly startago creepy startago uh wish I still had XTK um yeah you should he's good so Manuel Rogers probably Rogers Longterm Sessi or Jbury Hall? Uh, probably Senessi. Enzo or Sar. Uh, that was already answered. Minus four for Chow to Timber probably not benchless when in about 20 minutes. Richard or Chow is my third defender. Probably Richards player K or Thiago? Probably a KK. Do minus four to Palmer to Bruno? Uh, yes. Uh, actually no, don't do it. Fernandez and Snessi or Charenzo the the first one. Fernandez and Snessi early to Tim from minus four. So, why do you still have Sakarim? Because I haven't made the transfer yet. Fernandez and Sessio or Enzo and Chalaba? Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of questions that are really, really long that I don't really know how to answer on the Gordon thing. I reckon he's back soon. All the comments are from Newcastle fans are calling him out for the fake news as he can't be able to play anymore when there were three down thoughts. I have no thoughts towards that really. Um, what are your thoughts on Super Mendy? Don't like him as a pick. Hi mate. Start one. Tarovski Hill and Goodmanson start Tarovski probably. Uh, Semeno and Timber or Burma and Ciba? and timber probably Henderson for Chris Palace is worth in goal probably not uh he'll be cleaning Marmush's boots who Harland maybe Enzo Sar for a threew weekek punt how many times that one person asked that same question all right what else we got good pick for Keller whatever either uh star or Dfka probably Davka Wilson So, uh, start main cryp junior junior. [gasps] It doesn't work, does it? It just doesn't work as FPL content. I might I answered a lot of questions. I answered a lot of questions, but but it's not [laughter] but it's not entertaining. It's not useful. It's not uh there's no elaboration behind anything. And the chat clearly hates it. They don't want to listen to it. >> [laughter] >> Sometimes you just got to accept that not all questions will be answered, but those that do will be answered in in a nice amount of detail. You can actually maybe gain something from it or just find it interesting. I don't know. I don't know. Six or seven. Don't know. I don't know how how many people do you think left the stream during that like two minutes? I don't know. Everyone except the person uh whose question is being answered hates it. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Um and there's only one person getting having the questions answered at any given moment. And it's so fast. Can you even recognize when it's your question being answered? I don't know. I don't know. But hey, that was a bit of fun for a couple of minutes, wasn't it? [laughter] Yeah. Bench this. We'll do bench this in like 15 minutes time. and then we'll do loads of bench related questions. Although there seems to be a lot of bench related questions today. A lot of people have benching dilemmas. I feel like I'm the opposite. I I have more players that I want to bench and not enough players that I want to play. Uh keep your chin up, mate. Yeah, don't worry. The chin is chin chin is firmly up. Very firmly up. you answered my question, but I'm not sure. Uh, yeah. I mean, I didn't give any elaboration, so um there's no there's no elaborating, so no, of course. Of course, it's unconvincing. Bambi says, \"My bench is not good this week.\" I feel like I'm probably in a similar boat to you, Bambi. I'm I'm not feeling super confident about my bench this week. Um like Collins away against Newcastle is pretty much all I have. I mean Alderi away against Arsenal is not great. Obi not even going to play. But like when do you ever need to go two players deep on your bench? It's so rare. It's so rare that you, you know, your team is in you, you have like, it's only really like situations like Saka where a player you have, they have no injury issues whatsoever. You're fully aware of the situation and there is no situation and still somehow they pick up an injury in uh in the warm-up and suddenly, you know, you got an auto sub. If you're gonna get an auto sub, usually you have a you probably have an idea that it might happen. Like you see a you know you think you you know one of your players is a little rotation risk or even even rotation risk players they still usually come off the bench and get one pointers anyway. So unless the player is injured and you usually know about that ahead of time like it's very rare you get auto subs. I mean I certainly very rarely get auto subs and when I do I do not score points from them. Let me tell you that. Uh Simone says, \"Is Foden a bad option or maybe a good differential?\" I would say I would lean towards bad option, I think. Yeah, I think I'd be done with Foden at this point. It's a bad fixture. We got lots of fixtures. Uh we got some fixture congestion in the Premier League, so there's going to be rotation risk there as well. You know, there already has been with Foden, I think. Um I think I would be looking to sell if possible. Do you think Rhys James will start? I do not. I do not think Reese James will start. Apparently, he has a bit of an issue at the moment. So, I would not be feeling too confident about him. Polio says, \"I think I have made the mistake of wild carding. Could you please give us your personal plans on the chips and when to play them?\" Yeah, I mean I can certainly tell you when I'm going to be playing my chips because I think I'm the only one I'm I'm unsure about is um is it here? This one I'm looking for. The only one I'm unsure about is the triple captain, but I'm leaning towards playing that in game 26. And I'm going to I'm going to I'll talk about that in the team selection video, but I'm also going to make a Tik Tok uh slash Instagram reel about uh the triple captain situation. But I'm leaning towards playing it in gameweek 26 on Gabrielle only because I think there's too much uncertainty around a gameweek 36 triple captain because in my mind gameweek 26 is a triple captain week. The other possible triple captain weeks are gameweek 36 if that ends up being a double. I think there's a chance that 35 or 37 could also be double game weeks as well. Um so we'll see. you know, it's less likely, but you know, it's certainly possible. 35, 37 could be doubles. 36 could be is is more likely to be a double, but 26 is definitely a double. So, 26 looks like a good opportunity. As for the other chips, so I'm looking to wild card in gameweek 32. I'm looking to bench boost in 33. So, basically, I'll bench boost in 30 in gameweek 32 to set up a really nice, really strong bench boost team for gameweek 33. And then a lot of the teams who have a double gameweek in 33 will not play full stop in gameweek 34. So a lot of the doublers, most of the doublers in 33 will be the same teams the blank in 34. So you're going to want to make a quick transition between 33 and 34. And if you're looking to bench boost in gameweek 33, that means your full squad or most of your squad is going to be double gameweek players, which means that most of your squad is not going to have a fixture in gameweek 34. So quick transition needed. Um that could be a wild card, it could be a free hit depending on how you set this up. But yeah, for me it makes the most sense to free bench boost 33, free hit and 34. So in conclusion, triple captain most likely 26, possibly 36. Wild card 32, bench boost 33, free hit 34. That's my plan. And I think it is the most excluding the triple captain, which I don't think is obvious. I think there are definitely different ways to play that one. I think the remainder of the chips, the wild card 32, the benchm 33, and the free hit 34, that makes to me by far the most sense as a strategy to the extent where I'm not considering any other strategy. And that's unusual. Usually, you know, I've got a couple of different strategies in mind that could potentially work. This season is is a little different and the way I kind of see things kind of playing out. Um, I think this has got to be the way. I think this has got to be the way. So, yeah, that's that's uh that's what I'll be doing. That's what I'll be doing pretty much. I mean, if you've already used the wild card, I still think that's okay. I I think you can still do the same strategy if you've already used your wild card. You're just going to have to be a little bit more cautious around saving transfers, I guess, ready to maximize gaming 33. So only if you've already wild carded, you basically need to only make transfers when strictly necessary because what you want to do is you want to have five free transfers in gameweek 32. Use one of them to bring in a a double game player and then in game 33 you'll have five again and then you're going to use all five and then you can free hit in game 34. So I still if you've already wild carded this strategy is still possible. is slightly more difficult and you do have to be a little bit more cautious around the moves that you're making particularly in the short to medium term between now and game week 31. You basically can't change your team very much at all and then the strategy is still possible. But if you've already used your free hit, that's when you're probably going to be in trouble. If you've already used your wild card and your free hit before gameweek, if you if you use both your wild card and your free hit before gameweek 32, pretty much screwed in terms of chip strategy. If you use both by the time gaming 32 has has pass as well before the deadline hits, I guess, but hopefully most people can save at least one of those two chips for that by then. And then yeah, gameweek 34 is the is the tricky one. That's going to be the that's going to be the the blank game that screws a lot of people. And I think there's going to there's actually I think there's a lot of um there's going to be a lot of FPL points to be gained. There's going to be a lot of rank to be gained because what a lot of people will do is they'll see, oh man, I have my Arsenal players and my Man City players. They're blanking in in gaming 31 and I'm tripled up on Arsenal. I'm tripled up on Man City. I've got some Crystal Palace players in. I', you know, maybe got some Wolves players in as well. They'll look at game week 31 and they'll think I'm going to free hit this week or I'm going to wild card this week because that's how I'm going to solve the situation. And then they'll get to game week 34 and instead of four teams blanking, it's eight teams blanking and then they'll just be completely screwed. So I think huge huge rank gains to be made in the period between gameweek 30 really 32 to 34. I think most engaged managers will be able to half their rank at least. Depends what your rank is I guess. But like, you know, if you even if you feel like I'm really struggling this season, I'm struggling to break into the top one million places. If you're ranked one million in gameweek 32 and you followed this chip strategy, I don't see why you wouldn't be ranked 500k by the end of gameweek 34. If you're ranked 100k, I don't see why you can't get to 50k over that three gameweek period. If you're at 200k, I don't see why you wouldn't be 100k after a three gaming period. And that late on in the season is is is a difficult time to gain major rank because the points gaps between ranks are a little larger. But I think there is um I think there's going to be some big opportunities to to gain because because it seems so clear to me that there is one clearly best chip strategy and I very much doubt that enough people will be engaged or you know really nerdy enough to be thinking about the these kind of things in that amount of detail. But there you go. Um, right. We got a super chat from Google Abroad who says, \"Bench one, Chia, Foden, Watkins, or Anderson.\" Uh, definitely wouldn't bench Anderson. Um, I think I would bench Foden. I think I would bench Foden. That's what I would do. Um, or ideally sell him. Ideally sell him. Jeremy says, \"I missed the variety of chip strategies. That was damn fine.\" And I agree with you. I mean, I wish I could I could I could see another chip strategy that I think would work. I mean, I've some I've seen some people say, \"Oh, what about, you know, free hit and gaming 33? Could that work?\" We never never know for sure what what will and won't work. Um, but I see a lot of problems and holes in a Gameweek 33 free hit strategy that just aren't there in a gameweek 34 free hit strategy. That's what I'll say there. Padra says, \"Hi, Dan. Start Morgan Rogers or Daniel Moz.\" You know what's crazy about that question and why it's when I was looking through the chat, it stuck up to me immediately because my name is Daniel. My wife's name is Morgan. So, you're saying start Daniel or Morgan? Me or my wife? Who should we start? And as such, I'm going to do the kind thing and say start Morgan and bench Daniel. That makes sense right now. There we go. Conspiracy right now. Dan, you never come across my algorithm anymore. Really? You need to like videos. [laughter] And that genuinely I know it's like it's obviously it's self- serving. I want people to like my videos, like my streams and stuff. Um but I think it genuinely it does help your um your your algorithm to recommend you the same content if you are liking it. So if you click like on a on a piece of content or you know what just watch the content all the way through then it will be recommended to you again on the algorithm the next video. Whereas if you kind of if you ignore a video on your on your algorithm or you don't like it it's less likely to appear. So, I don't know, maybe that will help. But yeah, no, um I think the uh the algorithm is is pretty crazy right now. I I think YouTube is is genuinely doing a really good job of promoting a much wider range of content from smaller creators, from larger creators, um and really trying to help the little guy in many respects. So, um yeah, it's um it's nice in that respect, but uh the algorithm is a little tricky. Plus, there's just so much FPL content now. It's not like a few years ago. There's so many FPL channels. It's uh it's hard to it's hard to stand out anymore. Um hopefully we're still doing a pretty good job over here. There's certainly enough of you guys sticking around that um that I'm still happy at least. Right. Um anyway, anyway, uh Thson Aronson is a differential. I I just think there's too many good midfielders right now to go there. Um so that's my opinion. Uh Michael says, \"Hi Dan, apologies. I've already answered but thoughts on Sack Mawke for two weeks.\" We haven't actually spoken about Madek today to be fair. So I'm happy to do a little little moment on him. Um so no, [laughter] no is the short answer. Um, one of the reasons is with Saka out, you know, I don't think we expect Mawke to play every single game. I think he will be managed a little bit. He's already played against Chelsea, already played against um, who did Arsenal play last week. Um, I've forgotten already leadeds. Leads. Um, he's already played against Leads. He's already played against Chelsea. Is he going to play Sunland, Brenford, Wigan, Wolves? maybe even Spurs. I don't know if he starts every game um in that period because that's a lot of games. So, you know, there's maybe one rest in there, maybe two. Then you've kind of got Trosard, FPL Vince, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel. Then you got Trosard and Martinelli who are capable of taking some minutes um on the wing. Maybe even maybe even Gabrielle Jesus could take some minutes off the wing as well. You never know. Havs maybe is a bit rogue. uh essay maybe a bit rogue but you know there are other options is what I'm saying and even if Madawek is the start is he starting 90 minutes probably not then we have Saka okay when is Saka going to be back well gameweek 27 looks like most likely right now what if he's actually available the second game in gameweek 26 so you get mad for 25 you get Mawke for the first game in 26 but actually he doesn't even play in the game at 26 not because he's rested with other players but because Saka's back already possibly and then we come to game 27 where we are expecting Sacka to be back by that point and you've guaranteed that you're going to have to spend another transfer on Madek. So really kind of spending two transfers to buy Mowk because you know for a fact that you'll have to transfer him back out again and and soon as well. It's not like a R. Like Rice, don't get me wrong, you're probably going to transfer him back out by 31 because he'll blank in 31. But you can keep Rice if you have other issues to deal with immediately, you can still keep Rice for every game week up until then if you need to. Whereas Madawke, you know, becomes a problem that needs addressing immediately. And if you already have if you also have like another injury in your team or something like that, then suddenly game of 27, you've got two issues that you need to deal with. uh and maybe only one transfer to uh in which to to resolve it. So yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know. I'm not massively feeling Mad. And there's a few reasons as to why. Hopefully that makes sense. Rice feels boring. I agree, Michael. Rice is boring. But um yeah, sometimes boring is right. And and I I will you know, if you watched me for a while, you'll always know I will always try and find the interesting angle if there is one. Unfortunately, this time I'm not sure there is, but yeah, I guess we'll see. Uh Tom Junior says, \"Saw you on the news, bro.\" Uh, this is news to me. Um, I don't know. Could you please elaborate? Or maybe you're typing on the wrong in the wrong live chat. I don't know. That's probably the most likely thing that's happened here because I don't think I've been in the in the news. Uh, Polio Scosby says, \"Mate, keep up the great work. Cheers from Boston. Boston. Well, cheers right back to you to to Boston. Cody Bllayy, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel. Right. Um I think I think we're ready for a bench list, aren't we? Couple of chats first. We've got super chat here from Jonathan. He says, \"Minus four for Joel Pedro.\" No, I don't even need to read the rest of this message to know the answer is no, but I will anyway. Um, minus four for J Pedro to cover for Semeno forwards or Munoz for O'Reilly so I don't have to play Muki or if O'Reilly is benched. Want both in the future. So no, I I don't I I no pretty much I wouldn't take a minus four for any of those. I would rather play O'Reilly or Mukle even O'Reilly one pointer off the bench and take a minus four. So no is the answer. I don't think I would take a minus four. I mean you got to think about it. Is it worth four points? Would you rather have just an assuming it's like a four-point auto sub? If things go wrong, then you're you're kind of up four points because you didn't take the minus four kind of thing. So really, you would need your replacement to outscore by five points. I guess if you assume a one-pointer from someone like O'Reilly or Muki, you need you need your replacement to score at least five points for it to reward you immediately. I don't know, man. I don't know, man. I think I think I think I'm I'm not I'm not feeling the Joel Pedro thing maybe as much as other people are. I don't think Semen needs covering. I don't think I think O'Reilly and Melli still have some use in the future. Yeah, I just I can't see it. Can't see the vision. I really can't. Um, but anyway, um, let's go ahead and do the bench list. I think you guys have been patient enough. Uh, right. So, let's um let's uh add some players here. So, where do you want to start? Um, I've got who I've got I've got a couple of players in there already. Um, and I'm pretty much happy with that as well. Let me know um, which players you'd like to see in the bench list. I'm going to throw Thiago in here. Um, Elliot Elliot Anderson in here as well. Elliot Anderson in there. Alder was going to go right to the bottom with Muki. Put M slightly above. Esteev would be for me pretty low still. Uh got super chat here from Jacob who says, \"Chow, creepy mane tarovski. Rank them one to four pull this game week, please. Also, I like the mustache, my man. Handlebar mustache in the future. Let's go, champ.\" I don't think I'm capable of of growing a handlebar mustache. It kind of only goes this far, unfortunately. Um, but there you go. Thank you at least. Um, but anyway, my friend, let's have a look at these players. So, Chiao, Creepy, Mani, Tarovski. Um, I mean, I can go ahead and probably put all of them on the bench list. So, let's do that. I think that's probably the best way to do this because I can see a few other people are asking for about similar players. So, I think we put Tarovski here. Um, we put ciao. Tough one here. Um, or would I just try Watkins ahead of these guys? I think I maybe would try Watkins ahead of these guys. Um, so maybe I try Watkins here. Okay. Uh, Bruno G. Can he go any higher? Probably not. So, we've got Chiao, we've got Tarakovski, we need Crooppy Junior and Mane. Creepy Junior is probably not going to be a player to play, is he? Because you got that rotation risk still. you've got that, you know, well, maybe not rotation risk, but you're going to get early sub. He gets early subbed every game. So, if he doesn't score from his one shot, you know, actually, it's not even if he doesn't score from his one shot. You need to hope that he takes one shot in 60 minutes so he can get the goal because he will score it. He's so clinical. His ball striking is just phenomenal. Um, but no, he's kind of a a pretty high high likelihood blank, isn't he? Kind of player. And as such, do you take a risk on him? Probably not, but maybe ahead of some of like the weaker defenders. So, Creepy Jr. will put him there. Mane Chelsea at home, it's not such a bad fixture, but you know, when you play for Wolves, it's pretty unlikely you're going to get attacking returns, right? So, um let's see. Man, they can go probably below creepy junior maybe. At least you're gonna get defcon for Richard and Stev. I don't know. I'm going to put Manet here. He has set pieces as well. Man, which is pretty nice. I'm going to put him there. Um, right. So, we've got a super chat here uh that says, \"Should I keep Kukura?\" Uh, yeah, I think for for the next couple of weeks, Kuko is fine to keep because the fixtures are good and I think he will start. There's no injury issue there, is there? So, um, yeah. Nice. Um, and then we can just start filling up with some of the other players you guys are suggesting. Uh, can I do Chaloba? No, Chaloba is a is a a play. Um, there's no questions around that one really. Um, Timber, no. I mean, really, are people really that worried about Timber this week? You play him. Maybe not ahead of Ekit to be fair. I do really like Ekit, but you play Timber. Gayhei. All right, now we're talking business. So Gayhei would go pretty low for me. Probably maybe even lower. Maybe bottom. Is that harsh? didn't catch wide cho ahead of Richards. I think it's just better chance of a clean sheet is um probably the the obvious answer. Um I think Brenford at home is probably a better fixture than Brighton away and I think Newcastle are probably a better defense than Crystal Palacear right now probably. So yeah, that's the reason there. Uh, sell Bruno G to Anderson and Bench Richards. Yeah, you know what? Yes, I quite like that. I quite like that. If it's for free. Yeah. Um, Lewis Hall can pretty much go right next to Ciao. Should there be that much of a gap between them? That's the only question. Am I that confident? Maybe I'm not. Maybe we'll throw so light ahead and with the deathcon gone. Are we being a bit harsh on riches? Can we throw him up one more? Let's bring them a little closer together. Right. Sessi. So sessi I like. Um Sessi I'd be definitely willing to put a little higher. It's not perfect. It's not ideal, but the defcon gs that he gets is um always very useful. Yeah, I'm going to put Hill alongside Cessi. They're much of a muchness these days. Evan Nilson against Aston Villa at home. H maybe here like that. N says, \"Hi Dan. Hope you're well. Triple United versus Spurs.\" Done. Nice. Nice. That's triple United attack, right Niky? Exciting stuff. Hope for a big scoring game then. Z the GA with a super chat here says Bruno G Chucky and a weak bench. Two playing defenders. Zero free transfers 2.6 on the bench. Is it worth to go on minus four for who? No, it's it's probably not worth going for a minus four. I think I mean I think Turkey will play. I think Bruno G has a good chance to play. The only way I would take a You got You got 2.6 in the back. The only way I would take a minus four is if you didn't have Bru uh Bruno Fernandez. But again, can you could could you do could you want Bruno G or Turkey to Bruno Fernandez? That would probably be worth a minus four because you could captain him. And outside of that, is there an argument to say Rice? If you don't have Rice and you need to get that Arsenal triple up anyway, maybe that's worth a minus four. And then and then so so yeah I I take a minus4 for Bruno Fernandez. I'd take a minus four for Rice. I would maybe take a minus four for Burmo. Less likely but still maybe Vertz but no one else. I wouldn't take a minus four for Enzo or Anderson or or anyone anyone else. Palmer. No. Yeah. So it's literally just those four players. Bruno, yes. Rice, yes. And Burmo, yeah, maybe that we we are very very much on the edge of whether it's worth it or not at that point. So there we go. Those are some players I would take a minus four for. No one else really. No one else really. Um if Harland doesn't start, what's the panic buy? There's no there's no panic buyers. Don't do not panic buy. Keep Har. If Harland doesn't start, then Harland is more likely to start the following game, not less likely. If Harland doesn't start, he's rested in his most difficult game against Liverpool and then has good fixtures after that. Great. That's good news for Harland, not bad news. It's bad news for Harland in game at 25, but it's good news for Harland in 26 because it means he's well rested for a better fixture. Um, so there is no panic buy if Harland doesn't start. But I think Harland's going to start anyway. So, um I don't think we'd even have to cross that bridge. Uh Jury Hassan says, \"Start Rogers, bench Crooppy and Sessi for Road on Start.\" I don't think I bench Rogers. So, yeah, start Rogers. Certainly ahead of Krooppy and indeed ahead of Sessi. Rodon is interesting. And a few people do have Rodon, don't they? And they're thinking Forest at home. It's not a bad fixture. Leads are okay. I'd maybe be a thing is Rodon doesn't really get Defcon and I think that's the one thing that's putting me off him. I'm going to put Rodon not super high. I'm going to I'm maybe going to put him here. And then that should be all of the players you mentioned. Hill is on there already. Virgil is a good one. Yeah, we haven't spoken about Virgil, have we? Someone asked Richards or Hill. Both of Richards and Hill are on the bench list, my friend. Um, Virgil. Okay, so Virgil is not going to go particularly high this week. Um, do I fancy him ahead of Richards? Um, tough. I kind of I kind of do. I kind of do, I think. Yeah. Okay, we'll go there. Big10 pound super chat here from Benjamin. Hopefully we can help you out here, Ben. Uh, hi Dan. Can you help me with your uh with my team, please? My team is Donnaruma, Chalaba, Ciba, Gabrielle, Fernandez, Rogers, Wilson, Seno, Jar, Pedro, and Harland. Is there any changes you would make? Um, I mean, if you have Drafka on your bench, I would maybe play Drafa ahead of Donnaruma, even if you have Darlow on your bench. I play Darlow ahead of Donnaruma as well. Uh, Chaloba, Civa, Gabrielle, great. You only have, hey, you only have two Arsenal players. Chala, Gabriel, Fernandez, Ro Wilson, midfielders looks in fairly good shape. Front line looks in fairly good shape. Is there an argument to sell Donnaruma to Rya and go triple Arsenal defense either that or sell your fifth midfielder to Rice? I don't know if that's affordable or not. Maybe Donnaruma because you need Triple Arsenal for next game week with the double. And if you have free transfers, you may as well go one week earlier and and grab that Sunderland fixture as well because that Sunderland fixture is good. Really good. So there you go, Benjamin. Hopefully those are a few possible solutions. Your priority now is to ensure that you have three Arsenal players for gameweek 26. If it's possible to to improve your team by doing it one week early, then I would do that. Um, so yeah, Rice in for your fifth midfielder. I wouldn't sell Bruno Rogers Wilson or Semeno for Rice this week. I wouldn't do any of those. But if you have a fifth midfielder that you would be willing to sell to get Rice, then I would do that. And I would be willing to do Donnaruma to to Rya as well. Even though it seems sideways, it isn't really. It's um it gets you the third Arsenal player and you can just hide him on your bench in game 31 when Arsenal have the blank and play the Brava. There we go. Right. Hopefully that was helpful. Hopefully that was helpful. Cool. All right. There you have it. There you have it. Chewy FPL says, \"I don't know how people have the mental capacity to watch a game owning triple defense. I did last season and it might have been the more most stressful game I've watched not involving my club.\" Yeah, I mean, even double defense is just it's just painful. It's just painful, man. It's painful. The FPL boys saying in Burma and Gabrielle were the best captains for this week. Your take down. I prefer Bruno Fernandez. I prefer Bruno Fernandez, but I I I don't think you were in the stream yet, comedy addict, but at this at the kind of front end of the stream. We spoke a little bit about captains. And I I included both and Gabrielle as in as part of that second tier of captains for this week alongside um who else did I say? I said ETK and uh maybe one other might not have been it might have just been Gabrielle and ETK. Maybe I mentioned one other but it certainly wasn't any Chelsea players. Um oh Harland Harland who's always technically a captain option but yeah Bruno's Bruno's the best. But yeah I like them. I like them. I like them too. Who have you bought instead of Enzo, Chewy? You've bought and Jai for the second time. You bought You brought second and Jai into your team somehow. Uh, [snorts] sell or keep Chiao if I keep him bench him or Garner. Oh, we could throw Ghana in in the uh bench list for sure. I would play Garner ahead of Chiao. Um, if if possible of Tarovski as well to be fair. Maybe even ahead ahead of Thiago. That would be close. I'm going to go I'm going to go I'm going to go here. Where's Wilson on the list? Wilson, go higher. You bought Estabal. [laughter] That's brave. That is brave. That is very brave. So, I'm going to put Wilson here. You know what I'm also going to do? I'm going to move I'm going to move Anderson up. Yeah, I'm going to put the Anderson next to his brother. Anderson. The Anderson brother. The Anderson twins next to each other. Kurt says, \"Hi, Dan. I'm new to the channel. I have to start one of Creeper Junior or Riches. Please help.\" Well, welcome first of all, Kurt Curt. And uh let me tell you that what you see on screen is for you purposely. And for anyone else who is also new to the channel, um if you haven't seen the bench list before, we probably should have done an explainer earlier, but um we've got a list here of players who a lot of people are considering benching. And we we've got them in an order, a a um a start order. Um the players towards the top I would be more willing to start. The players towards the bottom I would be looking to bench. If you have two players so in you know what were your examples Krooer Junior and Richer. So you got Croo Jun and Riches. You need to figure out what my personal recommendation or my preference to start. You look for the two players on the list. You can see okay Cooper Junior is down here and Riches is oh a little bit lower here. So given that Cooper Junior is higher on the list, then that means that I personally prefer to play Cooper Junior to riches and that is how um we answer that you may have seen similar bench lists on other YouTube channels. Let me assure you this is the original. This is the original bench list. Uh the first of its kind and it's been running for years and years and years. Um, but yes, there are other bench lists, but this is the OG. This is the OG. Um, right. What do we got here? Uh, Bazall FPL says, \"Hi, mate. Started my own FPL channel last week. Would love any feedback you have.\" Yeah, man. Um, feel free to send me a DM probably on Twitter or X, uh, with your channel link and I'll, um, I'll be happy to check it out for you, my friend. and welcome to the content creation community, my friend. Um, hopefully you're enjoying your your the creat the creativity the creation process so far. It's great fun, man. It's real real good hobby. Um, Ray Perry here says, \"Chelsea and Arsenal triple up with Mane on the bench. Ready for a double game with a bench boost for that. Forced to wild card this week due to poor form. I'm not super keen on a on a bench boost um next week and I'm not super keen on a Chelsea triple up either. I think triple up on Arsenal, yes, definitely. Chelsea double up I think is fine. Pick one defender, one attacker that you like. Um because after a couple of game weeks, Chelsea actually have some of the worst fixtures in the entire Premier League. So, it's going to be a lot of, you know, a lot of forced transfers. And if you've wild carded early, you're going to have blank gameweek 31 to contend with. You're going to have another blank gamewe in 34. You're going to have double gamweek 33. And these are going to, if you wild carded ear early, these are going to, you know, be real focuses of your transfers. You're going to need a lot of transfers for those. So, you can't really afford to be bringing in players now who you know you're going to have to transfer in soon. Every player that you bring in kind of has to work for five, six game weeks. and triple Chelsea just do not work for for more than three game weeks in in in three four game weeks time, three games time, whatever. Arguably, every Chelsea player is a cell. Every Chelsea player is it needs to be removed. So that's three transfers you're kind of banking in if you like. So yeah, I wouldn't do that. Um Mané maybe, maybe. Um I'm kind of a little on the fence with Mane. kind of useful for the bench boost, but I'm not also not really expecting any any FPL returns from him on a bench boost. Uh, sorry, on the on the on the on the double game week. Yeah, don't think I bench boost. I think there's going to be better opportunities. Got another super chat here from Benjamin again. Another £5. Benjamin, you need to stop spending all this money, my friend. I as much as I appreciate it. Um, two5 super chats is too much, man. It's too much. But anyway, just signed Ray. Forgot to mention, Dan, that my bench is Ruffs Lefay Muk Est. Okay. So, yeah, none of them really playable. Uh, est first on the bench and yeah, I wouldn't take a minus four for your bench. I'll just have a STE as your first bench option and see what happens next. I shall indeed uh say that. So, yeah, it looks like you're sorted, Ben. Looks like you're sorted, my friend. No need to go any further than that. A few people asking about a Jewsbury Hall. So I think we can throw him on the bench list. Got Jai here. Carl wants a Jai. Okay. Um so Jewsbury Hall I wouldn't put super high. I don't think you kind of be in the so territory perhaps. Something like here. Um maybe even that's a little generous. I don't know. Um and then would go a little higher. Maybe in Evan Nilson territory. Maybe a little higher. Let's throw him one above Evan Nelson. There we go. If I can spell his name. Cool. Cool. On the bench. No. Playing Burnley, man. You're not going to You're not going to bench Bowen. You're not going to bench Bowen. Calbertt Leuen. Calbertt Lewon is genuinely an interesting one. I would start Calbertt Lewin for what it's worth. Um probably ahead of a lot of these players really. Um here maybe pretty high. Why Anderson over Wilson? Anderson is the one player I don't have who I'm worried about not having this week. I think it's a good opportunity for defensive contributions. I think it's a good opportunity for clean sheets against this Everton side. I think he's got a 11 pointer loading really. I I do I mean obviously it's not guaranteed or anything like that, but I think there's a very real possibility of an 11 pointer from Anderson this week and that scares me a lot. Um, and you know, Calbertt Lewen, he's above Cal Lewen, for example. Cal Leuen would require two goals or a goal and an assist to to match that score line. And I don't think that's super likely. So, yeah, Anderson scares me this week. Like, a bad week is four points for Anderson. So, we're looking at a range really of four to 11 points for Anderson this week. It's not bad, is it? It's not bad at all. So, um, yeah, particularly for a defender be right up there. Uh, Cody says, \"Would you take a hit for Ma to Vertz or Burmo and play him instead of Gay?\" Uh, yeah, I think I would if you have no bench. Uh, yeah, I would. I would go formo before I went for Verts, I think. Um, and then we I think I think we will be revisiting Verts very soon, though. He looks good. Um, but I think Burma is probably a slightly higher priority because his good fixtures are kind of right now, aren't they? Yeah. Play Virgil or sell Muel for Chaloba? I'd play Virgil. Where would you put Band of Ven in the benching order? Oh, uh, not very high. Maybe higher than maybe higher than, uh, Gay, but that's about it. very low. What would your criteria be for selling Harland? Uh, okay. My criteria would be uh anterior crucet ligament injury. Yeah, if you got one of them, I would sell him in fairness. Like I have to admit it. I know, I know, I know it's a bit controversial. Uh but yeah, that would be my criteria to sell. Harland Oliver said, \"Dan, last week you called me your horse.\" That's a hint. What? What does that sentence mean? If I if to guess your rank every if you guess my rank in a spread of 100, I'll let you choose my captain. Let's see if you remember me. A spread of 100. Wait. Okay. If Okay, there's a sensible Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, Oliver. I remember now. I remember now. Yes. Everything's coming back. In that case, the the guess is easy. If it's a spread of 100, then my answer is 100. And then I get to pick your captain, Oliver. Oliver, let us know what is your rank. So, if it's between one and 200 in the world, I get to pick your captain. You're number four in the world. No way, dude. That's amazing. No way. Is that up from last week? I mean, even if he stayed the same, that's still incredible. I'm having a look right now. Uh, and we'll have a look at your your team as well, and we'll see what looks like your captain. Have you already made moves, Oliver? I'm sure we're all dying to know. So, number four FB manager in the world is in the chat right now. All right, so 64 points. Okay, so you're not moved. You're not moved. That's fine. That's fine. So, one person went up. You caught up on a little bit on that guy. I think you've overtaken this guy, but yeah, they've moved around you. Lisa Snells Chow for Timber or Chalaba. have no one from Chelsea. Get get a Timber if you haven't got your triple Arsenal. That's the priority. Way above Chelsea in my opinion. Anyway, how bad is my memory? Uh maybe not great. I mean it did come back to me. Uh go to my team. I did Watkins to who eligible? Oh, Evan Nilson. Huh? Can you captain Deon Nilson? Okay, in my defense, did I say to go to Evan Nelson? Maybe. But no, I don't think I would have because I remember saying last week in in the stream that I'm not massively keen on Evan Nilson. I remember saying I wasn't massively killing Ev Nelson and I definitely would not have said to captain him. Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to take responsibility for that one, Oliver. I mean, I can't remember exactly what I said. Maybe I'm lying. Maybe I've forgotten. But certainly from memory, I remember talking in that chat saying exactly the same as I've said about Joel Pedro today is that Wolves away is not actually that good of a fixture. But I probably also said that there aren't many other options in the forward position. Um, but I certainly wouldn't have recommended captaining it. Right. Right. It's fine. We're going to get back on the horse here. We need to get Bruno Fernandez. Oh, you advised me not to transfer in Evan Nelson last week, Jerry. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm sure I probably said the same thing to um to Oliver. All right. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. This can be You told me You told me not to do Watkins to Evan Nilson and I did it anyway and I captained him and it did me dirty. Oh, okay. Right. So, so I told you not to do something. You did it anyway. Oliver, stick me stick with me this time because we need to get you to win FPL. We need to get to win. Let me just go through these super chats first of all. Uh we got one here from Tammy Hats that says, \"I have Virgil Chala, Gabrielle, Mukiel, and Alder. Should I sell any to bring in Hill or should I roll my one free transfer?\" Um, I would just play Virgil Chaliba Gabrielle this week and roll. Um, yeah, bench Muki and Alder if possible. If you have to play Muki, fine. But anyway, let's have a look at Oliver's team. So, he sold Bruno G, brought in Rice, which I think is the right move. It would have been nice to get Bruno G in here. Um, all right. I'm choosing your captain then. How brave you feeling, Oliver? I mean, you're feeling brave enough that you captained Elvinson last week. I would be looking primarily in your team at Gabrielle and Bowen as captains. Um, so I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say Bowen. You feeling brave? Let's go Bowen then. Bowen against Burnley. I mean, it's not a bad um one to take on. a penalty taking Bowen in in form against Burnley, you know, are capable of getting defensive contribution points. Um, I think your captain is going to be Bowen because you don't have Bruno. If you have Bruno, I would just say Bruno, but it is a shame you don't have Bruno. I can't really figure out a way of you doing it. You're doing bow and captain brother. Let's get it. All right, man. All right, man. I will be I will be rooting for you. I will be thinking about uh you with your bow and captain. And make sure to join join the FPL Mate Classic League as well. Come on, man. I can see you're not in the FPL Mate Classic League. You're in vocals. You're in Raptors. Leave them. Leave them. Join mine. Um yeah. All right. Let's Let's get it. Let's see what you can do. Cool. All right. Good luck, Oliver. Let's get back to everyone else. Let's get back to everyone else. We got about 28 minutes till 27 uh minutes until deadline. Um I'll dip again. Haha. Then thanks. I'll join it right away. Nice one. Uh yeah, we've got 27 minutes until deadline. So, make sure you guys are almost there with your thoughts. Kappa Junior says, \"Bench Snessi or Creeper Jr.?\" I would bench Creeper Junior over Snessi. I believe that's what the bench doth say. And thank you very much for the super sticker, Noah. Uh not sure if you meant to attach a message there. I don't I think there's a limit on uh you know, you have to put in a certain amount of currency before it allow you to type in a message, but we'll keep an eye out for you in the chat. Noah. Um, Yash says, \"You said you were going to captain Gabrielle in one of your videos. What happened?\" Oh, I did. I did captain Gabrielle. When was that? It was like two game weeks ago. It went terribly. Uh, yeah, I captained Gabrielle in gameweek 23 for a one-pointer against who was it against? It was against Man United just as they decided to they were going to be a good football team. Um, and then I've got him I've got Gabriel as the vice captain right now. I said I captain Gabri for this week. I never said that. I never said I'll be captain Gabrielle this week. I said he I maybe might have said that he was an option. I might said I'm going to put him as a vice captain, but yeah. No, I've not really looked at Gabrielle captain at all this game week, but maybe next week. Actually, what who am I kidding? Definitely next week. Noah here says Turkey to rise from minus four was in Swiss Franks. Oh, Swiss Franks. I didn't even know. I mean, that makes sense. I was going to say, do they not use euros in Switzerland? But, you know, in in the uh in the quest for neutrality, I guess uh the common currency would not work. Um there we go. Yash, you must have watched an older video in my life. I was never captaining Gabriel this week. Um turkey to rice for a minus four. If you have nothing on your bench, then I guess yes. Um, yeah, it depends. It depends. If you can just kind of play someone else for this game week, then then fine. But, um, but generally that improves your team and it sets you up for the double game week. So, I'm not against that as a minus four. I'm not against it. One of the few players I would take a minus 44 for. So yeah, maybe maybe. Uh Lavari says, \"Hi Dan, greetings from Finland. Just wondering why all content creators prefer Thiago over Ciao even though Newcastle has been great at home this season.\" I mean they have been at home, but they've also been errorprone and we've kind of seen that a lot. Um we've seen that a lot this this uh this season. So the fact that you know like for example Ecat against Newcastle last week we saw Ekit get given a little bit of space as the striker and able to thrive in that that uh kind of situation. Thiago might have a similar situation. Thiago penalty taker. It's always difficult to bench a penalty taker. So yeah I would if I had Thiago I would play him ahead of Chiao. Yeah. Um but you know don't you know of course Newcastle they are better at home. That is a fact and if they were playing a better fixture maybe we'd be more bullish on on Chiao but yeah kind of fallen out of favor. Um Ruben says is Pedro worth it over Echitique? In my opinion no. Uh I prefer Echitique to Pedro even this gameweek. Uh someone says why no Chelsea players in this list. It's a bench list man. I mean is anyone thinking about benching Chelsea players? I don't think they are. I don't think they are. So, I don't think they really um need to go on here. True Killer says, \"Best captain of Enzo Bowen or Gabrielle.\" Um I would say probably Bowen, maybe Gabrielle, but probably Bowen. Where would you put Chalaba? You play Chaliba. You play Ch. There's There's There's no I can't think of a single situation in which I wouldn't play Chalaba. I would say Chalaba is arguably the third best defender this week in the entire game after Gabriel and Timber for this week specifically. I mean Rob says, \"Sorry I missed the member stream, but thanks for the advice. Bench Evan Nilson for Anderson.\" Nice. Nice. Yeah, I'm keen on Anderson this week. Bench one of Ech Wilson, Semeno or Rice. That's tough. Is the answer Semeno? Might be. Might be. Uh last minute uh pick hill or road on for the next three weeks. Hill. Hill. I'm team hill and I'll die on that hill. Who's your captain? My hill. My captain is my hill. My c my captain is going to be Bruno Fernandez. Pretty boring for me this week. I know. We all saying that I think in the overall player base, we'll still see we'll see a lot of Harland. We'll see a lot of Joel Pedro. Will Keen star I think he has a good chance. Collins on the bench list. Sure. to my fellow Collins owners. I would not be super confident. I wouldn't be a confident Colin. Um, but he's he's a defcon guy. I guess we put him above us on that basis. Something like that. Shane says, \"King for Anderson or play Krooppy. Best mid under 7 million.\" Best mid under 7 million is probably is Milasar now that we've seen him on penalties. Um it's myar 6.3 million I believe. Um yeah, if I had to bring in an under seven million midfielder right now, I would go S and I would go for S ahead of Enzo right now. If I didn't have Enzo already right now, I I pick S ahead of him. So yeah, there you go. Um or or of course Anderson at Forest is great as well. It depends. It depends. If you want to save a lot of money and you feel like having that money in the bank is going to be useful for maybe a future move, then go Anderson. But if you're happy to spend the money, um yeah, it's minus like it. Uh Tatty made the official FPL 11 for this week. What the uh the official FPL scout man, can you add his Milasar? No, he's not a bench option. He's a transfer option. This is a bench list. People aren't If you're buying Sar, you're not benching him. Let's be Let's be 100% honest with ourselves. Bench Semen. Does Semeno need to go on this bench list? I think he maybe does. Um, is it controversial to say I prefer Thiago to Seno? Maybe it is, but it's the truth. The truth. Rob says, \"Have you seen me and the official FBL scout in the same room?\" I haven't, to be fair, Rob. I haven't. Yeah, you might be on to something there. Wouldn't uh take the risk and start keen over Richard's. Um, I'd be will I I think I'd be willing to take the I think I'd be willing to take the risk. Problem is Michelenko's back in the Everton team. So, is Branthroy going to play left back again or is he going to play as center back? And is Keen going to drop to the bench? I don't know, man. It's so difficult. Keen is just a nightmare player at the moment, unfortunately. Yeah. Jamie is captaining Ibrahim Sangare. Wish me luck. Uh, good luck Jamie. I actually picked up Sangar for my fantasy gaming hub team if anyone plays that. Um, picked him up today this morning. I have been training him. Uh, Wr says, \"Have no bench cover. Stack Gu worried about timber starting. Zero free transfers. Would you take a hit to have cover or leave it and pray? Depends how much money you have in your um in your bank. Um all of these players are going to have to go eventually anyway with the maybe exception of stack by gaming 31 because of the blank game week. So I would be willing to take a minus four, but only if I had money in the bank. Like what could you do? You could do Dutu Anderson. You could do Duta Hill. you could do. Um I I can't unless you got loads of money in the bank, I don't think there's anyone I'd be willing to sell Gu for. Um so Sto would probably be the player you'd go, but like you have a full 11. Is it worth a minus four? Would it be worth a hit? Would I take a hit? I don't think I would. I think if it was my FPL team, I don't think I'd take a hit. So I think on that basis I have to give the recommendation that unfortunately boring answer no hit. No no no transfer. No hit no transfer football hub is talking to me to start to Bravka and Sessi and Estv and bench Petravvic. Yeah I agree. I'd play to Bravo over Petravvic. Um and I play Sessi over Esteev. That makes sense. Stack is injured. He can't go on the bench list. Surely if you have Somerville, you 100% start him as well. Like why else would you have Somerville but to start him? Remember this is a bench list, not a transfer list. Virgil, Chia, Richard, Sness, Vandenberg. Which three to play? Uh, the benchist does answer that to be fair, but the answer is ciao sessi Virgil. Um, struggling to give advice on Hin Capier because I have no idea if he's going to start or not. Really struggling with that one there. So, sorry. Very, very difficult to give a judgment. I guess if you have him, you start him. But Vert's on the bench list. No, if you have verts, you start him. He's not really a benchable guy. Uh, Chaloba's not going on the bench list. You play Chaloba in every situation. Few people have asked about benching Chalaba now. Honestly, I cannot think of a reason to to bench uh Chaloba. I really can't. Like, he's he's like I mean, I'll put him on because people are asking the question, but I can't think of a world in which I would bench this week if I had him. Crazy stuff. He's a good pick this week. He really is. 16 minutes to deadline, by the way, guys. Um, so if you are making transfers, make sure you you are you're beginning to thinking about locking them in. Um, don't really want to leave them to the last 5 minutes just in case there's any website errors or anything like that. Obvious red says, \"Hi, Dan. Whom should I bring in? Timber for Collins or Enzo for Tavanir or just roll and risk pricing out?\" I mean, I wouldn't I don't honest I'm struggling with Enzo. I feel like if I didn't have Enzo in my team already, I don't think I'd buy him. Um, Timber in for Collins, I would do. though Tim Timber I would do in for Collins. So I like that one. Not the Enzo for Tavanir move. We'll we'll revisit that one next week. Maybe. Um Kagan says looking to next week. Any interest in buying Mane? Not really. No, not really my friend. Um I think I'm pro you're pro even in the double game week you're probably looking at a four-pointer from him. So, in that sense, I think we could probably do better. Um, we've got Zacharias here says, \"My defense says Gabriel Snessi, Virgil Chow. Who do I leave out?\" Probably Virgil. Probably Virgil. Ruben says, \"Wilson or Joel to start?\" Oh, if if you have Joel Petro, you absolutely start him ahead of Wilson. Absolutely start him. Yeah, that would be a a pretty easy one. your thoughts on triple captain Gabrielle? Uh, I'm I'm going to talk about it. I'm gonna talk about it. Yeah, you could tle Arsenal defense is crazy, by the way, Rob. Um, yeah, I'm going to talk about it properly tomorrow. Well, I'm going to do I think a short form video tomorrow and then in my team selection video, I'll talk a little further around um him, which might be Tuesday. No, Monday. Maybe Monday or Tuesday. Um, but yes, uh, if you follow me on Tik Tok or Instagram, then, uh, there will be a video about Gabrielle Triple Captain on there and what your other options are and kind of what the deal is with that one. Bson O'Reilly likely to start and do 90. I think he does start. I do think he does start. I don't know if he does 90, but I think he does 60. But is that that useful against Liverpool? Not sure. O'Reilly on the bench list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean we could definitely put him on. You go low. Um as well arguably he go right at the bottom. Um is that harsh? Uh you're probably not looking to play I Riley this week, are you? Let's be real. Adlerfay, congratulations. You You've identified the only player that I would put lower than O'Reilly. Richards is already on the bench list. Um Patrick Cash on the bench list. H not really particularly high. Below Virgil, below Richards, probably below Collins, somewhere similar to a Stev maybe. Let's go here. I think I would argue we play Monard of N. It doesn't feel right. Um, yeah, let's go there. Have we done the Sen bit yet? Uh, no, we haven't. Nobody's asked. Nobody's asked for me to identify between Anderson and Anderson. So I've needed to I think people people are starting to understand the difference which is amazing and most people understood anyway. Uh Anderson for Collins. No, probably not. Foden. Do people still have Foden? Minions is the other player. uh mention there Zacharias I already answered answered your question my friend and I believe I said Virgil where's the toin cost gone I don't know it's been a while hasn't it nothing worth to coin costing right Martinez uh in goal maybe next to Pope we'll put him next to the Pope And who else? We said Munoz and we said Foden. I feel like you can put Munos reasonably high. If you have him, you probably got him here. I don't This is the last player on the bench list because the the text is just getting too small. No one's going to be able to read this. Um Odm was the other player. I said um I would be putting Fing pretty low. Uh I don't know. Like maybe is this harsh? Is that harsh? I don't know. It's just that risk of a onep pointer. It's just not worth it, is it? It's harsh, but it's causing too much pain. Is that is that Foden? Is V a play? Yeah, absolutely. Right. No more players on the bench there surely because this text is barely legible anymore. The over 60s in the chat are are struggling. Sorry to single you out, but I already know that you guys are struggling to read this and I can only apologize. Blame the people in the chat. Blame the people in the chat being too keen to get every differential player on the bench list. I can do no more. I can do no more. People talking about benching Harland is crazy. By the way, Roki, you forgot Palmer. If you own Palmer, 10.5 million, why are you thinking about benching him, man? Come on, be realistic. Ian with this with a member chat says, \"Hi, Dan. I'm late to the stream. Any update on Timber Watkins and Harland's fitness?\" Timber's apparently fine. Watkins is going to be in the squad. Harland, there's no fitness issues. There's no issues with Harland. People I think are reading into the comments about Harland too much. I don't think there's any news there. Few people are are saying they are struggling. Fraser had to move me to the big screen to read the text. This is why we we have to chill with the bench list a little bit. We have to chill with it a bit. I can only apologize. I rial from minus four. No, Leon, there were comments on Harland. I was just going on form. Oh, fair enough. Uh, yeah. No, there's no there's no injury issue. Why is Thiago so high? People are are changed their mind. on Thiago so much. He's a he's still a penalty taker. He's still a striker for a decent Brenford side. Like he's Thiago will will change the opinions on him very very quickly just like he did before. He will do it again. And all of the comments about why is Thiago high, why are you playing Thiago? I mean I don't even have Thiago, but I would play him if I had him probably. Um all those comments are gonna quickly dry up um in a few weeks time I think. Um you can zoom in on can you what on your phone when you on a YouTube video? I did not know that. [gasps] Oh my god. I didn't even realize. I just tried this. You can zoom in on a YouTube video. That's what I never knew that. I mean, it looks terrible, but I mean, it works. Wow. There we go. That's That is very much news to me. That is very much news to me. Uh right, we are getting towards uh towards deadline guys. Who's your differential of the week? Um differential of the week. What about uh what about Mad? MK makes the most sense, right? We know he's going to play. Dan is a YouTube veteran. He didn't know you can zoom. Well, I mean, in fairness, I don't really watch YouTube on my mobile phone, like ever. Certainly as a YouTube veteran, and I really am a YouTube veteran. I honestly I probably been making YouTube videos for as long as some people in this chat have been alive, which is crazy. Um, Rob says, \"Finally, I can just have Dan's face on my deadline stream.\" Is that what you want? Can't we just do this? If you want that, we can just do this. Not needed. Not needed. Uh, right. Do you feel Timber will start? I do. If I If I had to guess, I would say it's more likely that Timber starts and doesn't start, but I mean, I'm not 100% convinced. Why is DW uh H quite low? Who's DW? J Hall. Why is he quite low? um doesn't really get defensive contributions. Um doesn't get attacking returns that often. Everton not looking particularly strong in attack right now. Playing away from home, no penalties. I know a few reasons. Vat says Joel Pedro captain's thoughts. I mean he wouldn't he probably wouldn't make my top five, six, seven captains for this game week. So no, it's not something I would do. Um, I guess it's I guess some people like it, but I'm not one of those people. So, that's what my thoughts are as well Pedro. I think Wolves are particularly away from home is a harder game than it looks when judging on on the Premier League table. Um, I think there are better options and you got to think more about the not just about the fixture and the difficulty of the fixture but also like how is that game realistically going to play out? I don't know. Is your Pedro going to get much space? Zean says, \"Bro, please reply. I've asked 50 times Laqua Van Heeka or Bruno G. Which one to play? Ask 50 times. That's quite a lot of times. I'm so sorry I've not replied to you 50 times. Crazy. Roit says captaincy shout. I'd certainly put above uh Jedro. Yeah, Zean. I would play I would play maybe Laqua out of or would I? No, I I'd play Van Hecker. I'd play Van Heeka probably. I don't know. I don't know which one I'd play. Honestly, I don't know out of those players. It's You don't know if Bruno G is going to be available. Laqua possibly get Defcon, so that's nice. Van Hecka maybe won't as much, but I'm not expecting a clean sheet for Laqua. Uh I don't I honestly don't know. It's three-way coin toss. I'm struggling with that one. Um, I'm I'm really struggling with that. I don't know. Is there a threeway coin? If so, use that. I'm sorry for trolling you, but I wish I wish I had a clear answer on that. What does All right. If Instinct, what does Instinct say? If this is my team, Instinct, we've only got like two minutes till the deadline. Instinct says Laqua. Instinct says Laqua, but I have no idea if that's right. I might ask a robot. See what their projected points are. Okay, so uh if you give me one second. Um Oh, it reckons Van Heeka. All right, play Van Hecker. There you go. Right, we are super close to the deadline. Play van play van hecka is the answer. Um, we hopefully have all of the other bench related questions sorted on the bench list. If um you do want to just keep the bench list on screen for the last minute for whatever reason because you're still making changes, crazy. Um, then pause, take a screenshot, whatever. Um, but I should probably for the final minutes of the stream put my team on stream on screen because otherwise the show team gang are not going to be very happy with me. So this is what I am running with. I can see the show team gang in the chat already. We're almost to deadline. I've made my transfer. Saka Rice did that earlier in the stream. I've got Bruno captain, Gabrielle vice captain. We got Collins on the bench with Alder and Obi Drafco on the bench over Rya. We are ready to go. We are ready to go. The attack looks great in my team. In my opinion, my defense, Rya, Gabriel, Great Hill, Ciao. Who knows? Who knows what will happen, but I'll be here to find out. I'm excited. Uh, we have like got 40 seconds less than until deadline. We are really, really running out of time at this point. really running out of time. So, get those teams locked in. Get your team saved. Get your captain done. No more transfers now. The time has stopped. This time has ended. You run out of time. Run out of time. And you know what? Hang on. We'll we'll just get to the deadline and we'll go from there. We'll go from there. Zan is ready to go. Max is locked. Rob's asking about duck or chicken for tea. always chicken. Sambal's making Arsenal score predictions. Yo yabs is still asking Tarovski or Richardson. Who's Richardson? And the FPL deadline has passed. There we go. Gameweek 25. We are ready to go. Um, right. Is it worth sticking? [laughter] So, by the way, first of all, is everyone ready? Is everyone feeling confident? Are we happy with our captains? Let's check out the captain poll. Are we happy? Are we ready? Are we raring to go? That's what I want to know. Um, the captain poll final answers with Bruno Fernandez 74%, Joel Pedro 11%, Gabrielle 9%, and Harland just six%. Crazy. Crazy. Um, we got a random deadline question from Ian. That's a post deadline question that says, \"Do people still have house phones? Do those even exist anymore?\" I can tell you, Ian, I moved out from my like mom's house 10 years ago, maybe, maybe 10 years ago, maybe nine, and I have not once owned a house phone during that time. So, there are people who own a house phone. I don't know if they use them very often. I think my my nan still calls people on the house phone. And that's about it. Nans and people trying to sell you stuff are the two categories of people use house phones. So there we go. That those are the people. What phone does Pep call you on? My mobile phone, of course. What do you mean? Pep Guardiola calls me when he calls me. He calls me on my my my modded Have you seen these these modern mobile phones? What? They're crazy good because they're they're literally portable. You don't have to they don't attach to a wire to your wall or anything. They're new. They're new in um if it's the 1980s at least. They're new in and uh works the same as a as a as a telephone, but it's mobile. You plug it into your car or something. Um, is it electrical supply? Wasn't I wasn't around in the 80s. Scammers also use them. There you go. Another another category of people who use uh landline phones. That phone was in Wall Street. No, it wasn't. It was in my bedroom the whole time. Bedroom. Is this Is this my bedroom? This isn't my bedroom. I don't sleep in here. [laughter] I probably could sleep in here, but I don't. There's not even a bed in here. Why don't I call it my bed? My uh my bedroom. Guess it is technically a bedroom. It's the spare bedroom. Max says, \"I remember learning from last season. You wanted to be a bit more risk averse. Feel you've implemented your lessons from last season.\" I think I like taking risks a lot in FPL and I do like it and um I think what I've learned is to try and be a little smarter in the way I'm taking risks. So for example, if you look at my team, what are the risks that I'm taking? Okay, I'm picking databacked players maybe a little bit earlier, maybe one or two weeks earlier than other people. So I bought maybe in Burmo in a little early. I bought Enzo in maybe a little early. I've kept Anderson in the whole time. These are Anderson is a risky, you know, differential whatever player, but he's kind of boring and not really risky. So I think I don't think it's risky that I want to play. It's differential. I like to play a differential game. So I often buy players who are lowowned or particularly at the time they're lowowned and then you know people often get on in on them. I bought Chiao really early. I think he was under 1% when I first got him in. Hill was under 1% when I got him in last week. So, I'm trying to make take differential players who aren't necessarily risky players if that makes sense. So, I can still play differential. Collins as well um has been was like 2% owned 1.5% owned when um I bought him in something like that. So, I'm buying players who I I see something in that aren't necessarily risky but are differential. So, I'm able to play a differential game without necessarily taking a huge amount of risks. I don't know. So, yeah, I I feel like certainly this season is going better for me than the last couple of seasons. I've had two terrible seasons in a row. Um, yeah, Rob Taty would be an example of a a risky differential. Not a not a sensible differential, a risky differential. So, I don't know. I don't know. Also, captains, whenever there's an opportunity to go for a differential captain, I'll usually take it. Do you not think ownership goes up after people watch your videos? Not really. Not really. I'm not going to be uh overrating my influence here or anything like that. Um, yeah, probably not. Maybe a tiny, you know, we're talking about a few thousand people, which maybe we'll take some transfer advice. And you know, often when I buy differentials, people don't go for them. People don't want to follow me down those paths because they kind of would prefer to go for the slightly more popular options, which is fine, too. Um, and I don't think I'm I'm convincing enough. If I was coming off the back of my 243rd finish, then I think people would maybe be more convinced if when I suggest a differential. Now, they're probably like, \"Oh, here we go again.\" So I don't think I can convince people on differentials maybe as easily as I would have been able to previously. Um but yeah going for sensible high floor high ceiling differential players. Well high floor differential players. Some have high ceilings as well but most of them have high floors which is which is something I like. And just playing a long game. Think you're underestimating the lazy viewers that will just copy. Yeah. And there will be there will be, you know, a couple hundred people who will copy my team verbatim every week or at least as much as they can because they'll often be like last minute deadline changes or you know I make a move earlier in the week to for the purpose of price changes and it prices other people out. So it's actually surprisingly difficult. But Josh says, \"Yo, I wondering where you get your football shirts from.\" Everywhere, man. Everywhere. Like there's no uh lots from classic football shirts. They're not they're not particularly good value for money. Um gifts like birthdays, Christmases, family member goes on holiday, they'll often buy me a football shirt um because they know I collect them. Um yeah, or like directly from like Nike or Adidas or Sports Direct. Anywhere, man. Anywhere I can find them for a good price. anywhere I can find them. Um, is it worth waiting for the team news for Le versus Nottingham Forest? Does anyone care? Need a Benfica shirt. You know what? Maybe I do need a Benfica shirt. I need to get some Portuguese shirts. I haven't even got a Portugal Portugal national team shirt. I need to get that for the World Cup this year. Yeah, I wouldn't mind getting a a Portuguese club shirt as well. Should it be Benfica? Not Porto. Not Sporting. I don't think I go Sporting. I think my favorite Portuguese team is probably Porto though, not Benfica. I'm totally honest. Yeah. Anyway, um yeah, let's uh you can send me one. Nez, what size? What size? I really do need to open up a PO box. People often offer to send me football shirts like through YouTube and stuff, and I would love to see what you guys send me, but I just I just my issue is I don't know how comfortable I feel accepting gifts from people. Does that make sense? I would love to um I'd love to receive more football shirts. Of course I would, but it doesn't feel right to take. You should do a stream. I mean, yeah, if I was to do a uh I thought about doing some some second channel football shirt content of some variety because I do have some interesting football shirts. But um yeah, maybe another time. Um, but yeah, I think I'm I think we're gonna end the stream now because even though we could wait for Le versus Nottingham Forest team news is Isn't accepting a gift any different to Super Chat? Yeah, but I can't I can give something back with a super chat. I can like reply. I can talk. I can feel like I can have an instant impact back. I feel like I'm at least maybe somewhat earning it. Even that's debatable. But receiving a full-on gift is just like I don't know. It would mean people could see the top they bought in the pod. That's true. And maybe people would get a kick out that. But I mean that I don't know. I don't know. Feels arrogant. I don't know. Um I'll think about it. Maybe if like I'll do it like for one month only. I'll open up a a PO box and if people want to send stuff um then we can. And I'll encourage people to write messages and stuff that I can read out or whatever. up. Um, yes. Um, we're going to leave the uh double chest with Dan a akin to fun with flags. It could be. It could be. What would it be? Uh, joy with jerseys. Shirts and giggles. What? Shirts and giggles. Anyway, right. I'm trying to go. Um, yeah, I'm meeting her friends tonight. So, um, yeah, it'll be, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna go. I need to have a shower because I've been cooking in a football shirt for over an hour in the stream and how well, sorry, over two hours. Uh, two and a half hours pretty much. But, uh, yeah, guys, appreciate you guys today. Thank you for the super chats, the chats, the conversation, the the FBL stuff. Good luck this game week. Good luck. Um, enjoy it and and and prepare for more FB content and for more FO decision- making because the next deadline is on Tuesday. So, um, we got to be ready for it. Cheers, guys. Thank you so much for watching. Good luck this game week, and I will see you later, mates. Bye-bye. Oh, hey. Oh. Heat. Heat. Oh, oh, oh."
