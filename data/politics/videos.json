    "transcript": "The war with Ukraine is a totally manufactured war. They're not enemies of Russia. He needed a foreign enemy to start a war. He needed a war to distract the people so they're not marching on the Kremlin. They're fighting with a foreign enemy. That's what this war is about. This is what everybody misunderstands about this situation. And this is very important for Kier Starmer. It's very important for Macron. It's very important for everybody which is there is no way he is going to stop this war. There is nothing we can give him. This is not about NATO. This is not about an empire. It's not about patriotism of Russia. This is about a little man who's stolen too much money, who's scared of his own people. He needs a war and therefore this war will carry on. And this 20 point peace plan or this 28 point peace plan or whatever points peace plan Putin is not going to agree to. >> So you mentioned Starmmer there in Macron, but the truth is my very strong sense is that he's playing Trump along and Trump is falling for it. >> Well, I think that that's a generous way to ascribe Trump's motivations. So give me the ungenerous version. >> For reasons that we don't understand and you know there's been books written and thousand pages of ink spilled on this. Trump is more aligned with Putin than he is with Zilinski.",
