    "transcript": "This is the FPL Draft Zone, your fantasy [music] team's best signing of the season. Hello and welcome to the FPL Draft Zone, a podcast all about draft FPL. I'm Dom Crofts. I hope you are well and today we have a very special episode for you because I am joined by David Gurgis who has created an app specifically for us FPL draft managers. It's called Fantasy Footy. It's available online at fantasyfooty.xyz. It's available on the app store if you are an Apple user and it's coming to Android very soon indeed. David, thanks so much for joining us. >> No, no, thank you for having me. We're going to get right into your app very shortly and show off all its amazing features. But before we do that, you are out in Canada. There is loads of fantasy sport for Canadians out there. Loads and loads of options and yet you have chosen to set up a fantasy draft app for FPL. How did your obsession with FPL draft come about? >> Yeah. No, so I've always been in uh involved in soccer uh or football as you guys call it there. Um, so I've been playing it, been watching it as a kid. I used to go to school, come back, have to put in a VHS tape, uh, to record the games that was whatever was playing for my dad. Uh, and used to watch them again after work. Um, so was always involved. Played soccer growing up as a kid. Played today. Um, and then just started playing fantasy sports or fantasy soccer specifically um, not too long ago, couple years ago. Started with the World Cup actually the previous one. Um, was killing it, doing amazing. Then I actually went to the World Cup, didn't do I forgot about the fantasy app and then came back and then just started with fantasy uh in the Premier League in the FPL and then started playing the uh fantasy draft a lot more and just got really into it. >> Got into it so much that you've decided to create an app for draft managers. How do you even go about doing something like that? >> Yeah. Yeah. No, so I'm a software developer uh in essence and so I was just looking at stats and trying to understand um more data from the league and our our like our league with my group of friends that we were playing with and just wanted to know who was unlucky, who was lucky, what if this would have happened if I had this trade, would I have won? Would I have would that have changed any outcome? And just started pulling data, writing scripts and going from there. Fantastic. Well, let's get into the app then. First of all, we're going to take you through some of the features. So, the appeal of this app for me is that it's got loads of little nuggets that you cannot get anywhere else. It has got your live head-to-head tracking, so you can follow your matches every game week live. Gives you full point breakdowns, projected points, automatic subs, indicators for players on track for bonus points, defensive contributions as well. It also does transfer activity insight, so you can track how active each manager has been in the transfer market, which players have moved around the most between teams. What I love, one of the features I really love is the manager performance stats. So, obviously you have the league table in FPL Draft, but you can create in your app league tables based on loads of other metrics. whose team has scored the most goals, who's got the most assists, bonus points, how that impacts the way the league table would look if that was the chief metric. And then you've got unlucky stats. Tell us what unlucky stats are. >> Yeah. So, that was one of the reasons why I made the app in the start was I wanted to calculate was I just unlucky in my I guess in my matchups. Did someone else have easier matchups? Were they always versing someone that was scoring less? Um, so basically the unlucky stats uh takes everyone's scores every week, calculates the median and sees if you scored above it or below it. And if you scored below the median and you uh or if you scored above the median and lost, then you're considered unlucky. And we do that every week to week. Um, and we keep track of it. And then we create a table where you can calculate who is the most lucky and unlucky person. Um, and you can see everyone's stats there. Um, so we have a a metric to measure how unlucky you were instead of someone just claiming to be the unluckiest. >> Absolutely brilliant. It's also got bench points lost which tracks how many points each manager has lost to the bench across the season. And another one that I absolutely love is the whatif tool. So tell us what the whatif tool is. >> Yeah, so that's another one of uh the popular features I think people love using. Um, basically it calculates what if I was to swap with someone else's schedule. Um, would I have would I have ranked or would I be in a different position? So, if I had someone else's schedule, would I be first, would I be second? And it does that with everyone and calculates your best swap. So, if who would I have swapped or who should I have swapped with and been highest ranking in my league right now? >> Brilliant stuff. Well, what we've done is we have taken all the data from your app and we've plugged it into one of our leagues, which is the FPL Draft Zone Championship. There are three leagues at the FPL Draft Zone and the Championship is the Middle League. It's got 10 managers in. It is a head-to-head format. So, let's first of all take a look at the league analytics page that pops up on the app when you load it up. The league analytics on the lefth hand side, if you're watching us on YouTube, has quick stats. So, it has the most FPL points in that league. So, the team top of the league, well, not necessarily top of the league, I suppose, but the team who's accured the most points, which in this case after 24 gameweeks is 1,152. It has the fewest FPL points. It has the total matches played and the point spread. And it also has little individual stats that give you bragging rights over your mate. So, the top gameweek score of the season so far, 75 points, which I'm proud to say was my team. Uh and the best win streak in the league, six wins on the spin and that goes to Liam Smith whose side is draft excluded and who are top of the table as you can see in the middle column. Current win streaks are also ranked. So I have a twoame win streak right now and that puts me top. And then on the right hand side is a little line graph which you can plot every single team into and that tells you week by week where you were in the league at any given week and plots out your entire season. So that is that's the the sort of the league analytics tool. This is something I absolutely love which is all leagues combined. Tell us what this is. >> Yeah, so this is on the website actually. So, this allows you if you're in multiple leagues, you can just input both all your leagues into your account and then you can combine them to see how you rank um throughout all your leagues and how everyone ranks in that sense. And it has the league name in them. And that's why you can see that there's different league names for everyone. >> Yeah. So, this is four different leagues. We've got the three FPL draft zone leagues and also one of my local leagues. And these are the top 10 total scores across those leagues. So shout outs to Tyler Keller, Liam Smith, and Tom Waldy who make up the top four. Dan Walker just missing out on the top four. He's in fifth. And George Stthopoulos is down in 10th. But very competitive when you look at that. That is like almost like the ultimate draft league, isn't it? It's fantastic idea. We've also got the best manager tool, which is another really interesting one. Obviously, you've got the league table, which is what it's all about, but this is how other metrics measure your teams. So, a reminder that in this league, Liam Smith is top, Mike Whitefield is second, and I am third. So, the total points are on the left hand column of the screen if you're watching this on YouTube. Liam's got 49 points, Mike's got 45, and I've got 42. But if you look at the goals on the right hand side of this screen in the third column, that tells you an awful lot about why Liam is top of the league because he's side has scored 223 goals. And that is miles clear of anyone else in this league. I'm down in sixth with 164 and Mike who's third has got 171. So, this is the sort of thing, David, where you sort of look at these stats almost through a different lens because you're looking at them and you're going, actually, that's where I'm failing. That's where I'm succeeding. And I think we've got more of that on the next page because in the assist ranking, if you look on the left hand side of this column, Mike, who's second in the league, is ninth for assists. And Liam, who's top, is down in sixth. Pretty crazy. The same could be said about clean sheets. Mike's got a pretty good defensive record. His title challenge is built on defense from the looks of it. And I'm down in ninth with just 101 clean sheets. And then saves. I'm up in second with 25. And Mike is down in 12th. And Liam is eighth. Bonus points. Liam is well clear and I am in third. And Mike Whitefield second in the league down in 64. So, what would you say when you're looking at these sort of metrics and you're looking at the differences? Do you as a manager, as a draft manager, look at these and go, \"Okay, I need to get players in who are scoring more goals. I need to get players in who are scoring more bonus points.\" Do you look at them and do you use them for your own draft team and try and work out where it is you're going wrong? >> Yeah. No, that's exactly where I do use them actually. I look at them, you see a breakdown of where you're lacking, where you're not lacking, and I try to adjust it. So, if I'm if I'm really low in I guess um like like goals, then maybe I'm going to need to try to fix up my forwards, my mids, see maybe get more attacking mids um and and just try to fix that up because you can generally see a th a trend when you look at players that are top in the league and then when you're looking at yourself and try to improve your squad as much as you can. Um and the website has even more of a breakdown where you can see uh by position uh by by players and so on. Um, so I can look at my my defense and see how I rank defensively in my league versus maybe who's first defensively. Um, so use that always to help me pick up players or trade players throughout the league. >> I always thought defensively I was pretty solid, but ninth out of 10 for clean sheets, that is where I am going wrong in this league. It's also got a lovely head-to-head feature, which is a live head-to-head. So on a match day it will give you updates live as to what's happening. On the left hand side of the screen you can see that this is taken from gameweek 24 where in this league there were five matches. The average score across those five matches and 10 teams was 42 and a half points. And down at the bottom of the screen you can see the individual matchup. So that week I actually played Whitefield's Warriors and edged that one and the league leader Liam Smith beat Gab Gabrielle Blide House in a very highscoring 5751. But it also has top scorers for every game week as well which is another nice little chart that you can follow. And on this week it was Hugo Eat who came out on top alongside Casemiro with Florian Vvers Domanki and Kenati making up the top five. Tell us about the transfer analysis tool. >> Yeah. No. So, in my league, we have one person that pretty much dominates our transfer window every every week. Um, with a ton of trades in, backup trades, waiverss, and so on. Um, so the transfer tool is just a way of tracking it. Unfortunately, the Premier League app doesn't actually provide you any of that stuff. It shows you during the week of, and then they disappear. Um, so this is a way where you can track, see how many trades are happening, who's has the most trades in your league, and what kind of trades they're doing, and just keeps a record of them. And then that way you can actually look at analysis afterwards. Was this trade good? Was it bad? Would this trade um have cost me the match? Or did it did it cost me or did it not? Uh did it make me lose my matchup that week? Um so it's it's really cool stat that it helps and you can constantly see who's trading for what. And if you want to maybe look at the next week's matchup, I'm playing against someone else, you can look at it and see if they're more likely to make a trade or not based off their previous trades as well. So, in this league after 24 weeks, 601 transfers. Is that above average, below average, or about about average? What do we think? >> It looks like it's uh it's a high number there. I won't I won't lie for sure. But, uh every season has people that are trading constantly, but there's there's been higher I've seen, and there's been much lower, of course. >> Good to know. Uh you did mention there that you can track good transfers and bad transfers, and this is another bragging rights kind of feature. It lists the best trade of the season in your individual leagues and the worst trade of the season in your individual leagues. So in this league, Burke has the bragging rights because he traded out Meankovic in game week six and brought in Alderete of Sunderland, which gave him a plus 16 point swing. And Liam may be top of the league, but he had a stinker in gameweek 12, transferring out Marillo for Van Hec and costing himself 15 points in the process. So, another lovely little feature there that really does get you the sort of the adrenaline pumping when it comes to your rival managers. We talked a little bit earlier about unlucky analysis. We've got on screen what it is on the app then how it explains it, but do you want to just talk us through this again? >> Yeah, so pretty much this is the way that I calculate if you're lucky or unlucky. Um, so an unlucky loss, you scored above the median and you still lost or uh if you're lucky, you scored below the median and you won. And then we calculate something called a luck score. So we take if you the amount of luck like lucky wins you've had and we take the unlucky losses and we calculate your score overall. So that way we can calculate if you wanted to look at who's unlucky but at the same time maybe you've been lucky a bunch of times as well >> in your league. Are you a lucky manager? >> I am I think I'm on the average or I'm one above lucky. There are much luckier people in my league and there are much unlucky much more people that are unlucky in my league. So, I'm in the middle. So, >> okay. Well, let's take a look what it's like in this league. The most unlucky manager is Tark Life, managed by James Doyle, who has had three unlucky losses, which means he's down minus three on luck because he has had no lucky wins. On the right hand side of the screen, you can see how this plays out. I'm pretty unlucky as well, by the way. Two unlucky losses, no no lucky wins. Murder on the Dano has had a bit of luck and a bit of bad luck. Three unlucky losses, two lucky wins. And Isaac Kaer, two unlucky losses, and one lucky win. But look who's at the bottom of that table. Mike Whitefield in second place in the league. Two unlucky losses, five lucky wins. when you look at something like that and and also I should say by the way Liam is in fifth for luck rankings. Two unlucky losses, two lucky wins. So he's breaking even. When you look at Mike Whitefield there, is that telling us that he's maybe in a position that he perhaps shouldn't be in. >> Could be, could be not. Time will only tell. >> Time will only tell. Very, very diplomatic of you there, David. I appreciate that. Let's talk about the whatif analysis then. So tell us what this is that we're looking at on screen. >> Yeah, so this is a hypothetical um scenario where if I I will take my team or my uh and compare it with the rest of the league and if I was to have someone else's matchups. So it shows me in this purple little window your current position uh your actual record. So your wins, draws, and losses and your luck factor. And then afterwards um there will be a drop-own menu where you can go and you'll see if I had someone else's schedule where you would actually rank. Um, so that way you can actually see what if I had someone else's, I I I would have been first maybe or maybe you would have been last or maybe first would have been last if they had my schedule. We never know. So this is an actual way of calculating every single scenario that's out there and um and just showing you in your league where you would have ranked. And I feel like we're picking a bit on Mike here, but we the only reason we've used Whitefield's Warriors here is because his league position changes so much based on each manager's schedule. So, we're going to have a look at that now. So, if he had the schedule of Liam Smith, who's top of the league, Mike, who is currently second, would be down one place in third. I'm in third place at the moment. If he had my schedule, he'd be down in fourth. But if you look on the right hand side of this screen if he had Burke's fixture schedule, he wouldn't be second in the league. He would be bottom of the league. I mean, that is an absolutely unbelievable statistic and it's something that you just cannot get anywhere else. No, you can't. And it's it's something that uh shocks everyone when they see it. And and there's even a tool beside it. There's another tab where it'll allow you to see the breakdown of week by week. Some people don't believe it, but that way you can track it week by week and see it. But yeah, maybe he's just lucky that he got his schedule then and not Burks. It looks like >> it does [laughter] look that way, doesn't it? It does. If he wins the league, my god. Okay, let's take a look at bench points lost. This is another tool that again I have not seen anywhere else. So, why don't you tell us about this? >> Yeah, I know. So, um, typically we have people in our league that are always leaving players on the bench, always picking the wrong players to start and losing so many points on the bench and losing game week. So, this is just a way to track like every week how many points were lost on your bench and how many and week by week who the who the player was and how many points that was. And then at the end, it's nice to see like who had the most and who had the least. And it could have been from injuries, could have been from just poor man team management. I guess you'll have to do a further analysis for that. >> I was going to say it's either poor management or bad luck or a bit of both. In this league, 1,339 points have been left on the bench in the first 24 weeks of this season. That's an average of 134 points per manager. But the manager who has wasted the most points by benching players he shouldn't have is James Doyle, who has cost himself 206 points. And by contrast, Liam Smith, who is top of the league, has cost himself just 135. When you look at this, and you've obviously got access to all sorts of leagues, and you and you you use your leagues presumably in your app, is 206 points a lot of points to leave on the bench, or is that is that an acceptable amount? >> I won't lie, it is a lot more than what we have in our league and it is uh typically more than the average. Um, but there are leagues that actually have more than that. Um, but everyone plays differently. Everyone is unlucky at times. Benching players or sometimes the smaller leagues, they have better players and their bench is typically better players that are possibly going to high have a higher ceiling. Uh, but in this scenario, it it does seem high for a 10erson league. >> Okay, that's interesting to know, James. Do better, my friend. Do better. Okay, let's talk win streaks. This is another nice little feature you've got. What's this all about? >> Yeah, this is a way of just seeing who who's on fire, who's basically um like like winning their games, who's losing their games in a row. And then the longest unbeaten is even with ties, like with draws, any kind of draws that are there. So, looks like Liam is on a winning streak, and we're going to see who's going to be the one to break it. Um, and then Richard, he's on a losing streak, but I guess he Richard's got to do something different uh to break this losing streak of his. >> Yeah, I I think if you get three plus wins, you're classed as on fire. If you get three plus losses, you're classed as ice cold. And then the season records, again, nice bragging right opportunity for you. So, the longest win streak in this league, Liam Smith with six wins. The longest unbeaten, eight games again, Liam Smith. and the longest losing streak, Richard Ellinger with nine losses. Although I should say Richard is now no longer bottom of this league. So well done to Richard for plugging away and finally getting himself off the bottom of that league. Tell us about this as well. This is the end of season summary. So this is another tool that you offer at the end of each campaign. >> Yeah, so this is something that I came up with last season. Um I was when I would pull the data and all that, the data is typically deleted at the end of the season. Um, so I wanted a way of keeping remembering the previous seasons on how did everyone do? Um, what was your squad? Um, how did everyone rank compared to everyone? So this is just something that I created and it it basically every manager is listed at the very top in a certain color with their points and you basically follow your color. So you'll see when you go down you'll have your MVP player. So the player that you had on your squad throughout your season that got you the most points. You'll see a breakdown in a little bit of circle graphs. you'll see uh a breakdown of where majority of the points came that season. Was it from forwards, midfielders, defenders? Um and that can help you with planning your next season can help you planning this season. And then at the end of this whole PDF is my favorite feature is where you see your starting 11, your top players that with all the trades that you've been doing that got you the most points throughout the entire season that year. Um and just a little visual so you can see everyone and it's a nice way of just keeping record of that season. This is how we all did. >> It's lovely stuff. So, when you started this app, before you launched it and you kept it to yourself and you were testing and testing and testing, was there not a part of you that thought, I'm going to absolutely coast my leagues if I keep this to myself? >> I I I wish that was the case, but uh in the end, there's so much stats, there's so much uh stuff that happens, but you never know what's going to happen. You're going to find a player that was dominating in the previous season not dominating in this coming season and vice versa. The players that come out of nowhere that just start an amazing form scoring goals, defensive contributions, a new rule that came out of there. So stuff's always changing. There's so many factors and this is just one tool that can help you, I guess, optimize and probably make better decisions. But in the end of the day, unfortunately, there's no tool that can just win you the league for you. And there are so many amazing features, the sort of features that I have never seen anywhere else, which makes it so good. Have you got any in the back of your mind where you're like, I haven't actually introduced this feature yet, but this is next on my list of the things I want to bring to this app. >> Yeah. No, so we have a handful of features that I have uh me and a group my friends and all the feedback I've gotten from just users throughout the uh using it because I'm active user on this as well. I we have our iOS app that just came out and I love the widgets. Um, so I have a widget that you can see all the scores, everyone head-to-head. Uh, but every week I there's more features that I'm planning on working on in development, but um I guess we'll have to wait to see them all come out. >> And you mentioned there that it is available on the App Store for iPhone users. When is it going to be available for Android users? >> So, we're hoping or I'm hoping in 3 weeks. uh roughly is a rough timeline, but um it's all going to depend on I guess how far I get in development in that side and the approval process with the Google Play Store. Um so all a bunch of factors to take into account, but I'm hoping as soon as possible, >> but in the meantime, it is available online as well at fantasyfooty.xyz. Would you ever consider approaching Fantasy Premier League and saying, do you want to get into into a partnership with this? Is that is that your end goal or is this really just something that you you're sort of seeing where you can take it? >> Yeah. No. Um so I this was always just a passion of mine just trying to calculate if I was unlucky and lucky and turned into something really big with a lot of uh interest from others. Uh but no, I would love it if the Premier League could integrate all these features, all these metrics and all this directly into their app. I have no problem helping them with that. or if they want to kind of have a way to connect this app to that one at their own, that would be great as well. Um, but I think it's something I'll continue to work on just in my meantime and spend to improve as much as I can just for any FPL draft users. Just feel like it's neglected a little bit on the FPL app. It absolutely is. So, David, one other question I have for you is obviously you've got the standard app elements, but you've also got the premium elements. So, if you want access to the premium elements, how much have you got to pay for that? >> Yeah, so the price is currently $5. Um, and then I think majority of people are using it in the UK right now and I think that's around 3.5 quid over there. Um, so um the goal is hopefully one day maybe we can get rid of the pricing uh and integrate directly with the Premier League. Maybe we'll take a different route, but I'm trying to get as much I'm trying to get the price down as much as possible um and just cover the cost of hosting an app and database and all this kind of backend stuff that the users typically don't know um is there. So um I'm hoping that it's not too much money for a person that's using it and um doing my best for everyone. >> It's fantastic. We're we're all extremely grateful. So, Fantasy Footy is the app. Tell us one more time how people can access it and how they go about getting it. >> Yeah, so you can access Fantasy Footy directly in the iOS app store by just searching Fantasy Footy and downloading it there, making your own account and they have a nice search on there where you can look up your league ID. U just writing your name or your league name or even your your the name that you made for your team. Um it's also available online on websites. So, fantasyfooty.xyz. Um, you can make your account there. There's a free version and a premium version there as well. And hopefully we're coming to um Android soon or Google Play Store uh for everyone else. Um, but that will be in the future. And we're on um Instagram X, Tik Tok, and we're hoping to expand further and further. Uh, but so far we're working our best. And if you have any questions there, my email is throughout so anyone can email if you they get stuck anywhere. >> Fantastic. Give us your socials then. What are you on Instagram and X? >> Fantasy footie. So fantasyfooty.xyz or just fantasyfooty. Um you'll be able to find us throughout um using that. >> Fantastic. David, it's been a pleasure talking to you. Thank you so much. I think it's a brilliant app. Everybody needs to go and check it out. It's got so many amazing features that you just don't find anywhere else. I'm very grateful for you spending some time chatting to me about it. That is it for this week's edition of the FPL draft and we'll be back very soon indeed with another look at another gameweek. But until next time, it is bye for now. [music] [music]",

    "transcript": "Cole Palmer is unsurprisingly the most transferred in player this round. Over 95,000 managers have already transferred in the Chelsea player. Another penalty goal in gameweek 26. His Chelsea teammate J Pedro is the second most transferred in. He always appears on these lists at the moment because of the fantastic form that he's in. In this game in gameweek 26, he had seven shots in the box, which was the highest in any Premier League match he's ever played. And his 48 points from his last five matches is the best run of any player. Anton Semeno makes up the top three for the most transferred in. He's 14point hole in gameweek 26 shows just why he is so popular in FPL. With Cole Palmer and J Pedro the most transferred in players. Maybe it's not surprising to see Enzo Fernandez right at the top of the most transferred out list. He has been so disappointing in the last couple of weeks, especially as when K Palmer isn't on the pitch, he is on penalties and there's been three of those for Chelsea. But K Palmer has taken all of them. Now that the double game week is in play, Declan Rice is the second most transferred out player. Over 41,000 managers have sold the Arsenal midfielder despite the fact that he still has to play again in double game week 26. Declan Rice and Arsenal of course will blank in 31 and maybe that's why managers are getting off early. For the midfielder, Harry Wilson is the third most transferred out. A few weeks ago, he was the darling of FPL, the player that everybody wanted. However, he's risen in price dramatically and cost six million and has failed to return in the last three game weeks.",

    "transcript": "Rya, Richards, Anderson, Gabrielle, and Burma, Anson, Rice, Bruno, Ekit, Tikke, Harland, Thiago. So, as I said, I don't have any Chelsea, but I haven't owned Chelsea for Brenford, Pales, West Ham, Wolves, leads, so >> you got a red arrow. >> It's true. So, I'm not going to own one for Burnley. It's the final game in the in the in the run, and I'm not going to buy one. So, I'm quite happy with Echitik Harland, Thiago, and defensively, it's okay. Like from next week, Anderson has a pretty good run. So Gabrielle just plays every week, Richards. So I do feel like I need a defender. And as much as Doru out is probably the sensible thing to do, Tarosski to Collins frees up money for rise to Vertz. I haven't decided if I definitely want verts. It could be Rogers, but those Liverpool fixtures are very appealing.",

    "transcript": "Hi everyone, welcome to Early Thoughts. Looking ahead of gameweek 27. And as you can see, the superstar Praz is not here. But don't worry, don't worry. I've got an unbelievable replacement. Sam, how you doing? >> I'm like the world's worst substitute for Pra. >> N you're an excellent substitute. >> Everyone coming here to see Pra, I'm really sorry. You're stuck with me for a little bit, but Paz will be back for 27 prop, but he'll be back for your final thoughts. So, he's he's only a temporary substitution. I'm like the interim. We're going to talk about some managers later, aren't we? So, we we'll consider me the interim manager while Pra is out of action. >> Praise hasn't been sacked like Thomas Frank. He hasn't been sacked. Don't worry, he'll be back. It's just uh you know these superstar content creators, Sam, soon as this FA Cup or international break, they're jet setting. >> I know. gone. Nah, they don't do content. >> He's like, \"Sorry, guys. I'm out of here. I got to take my holiday while I can.\" He's like, \"The Spurs players off on a 12-day break.\" >> That's what he's doing. >> Rest in recuperation. >> Exactly. Let's hope he does return like you said for final thoughts for gameweek 27. Um, great timing to have you, Sam. Great timing because a lot we're still we're recording Thursday night. The Arsenal game is currently on. We'll try and keep up with the updates on that. But also look what's happened at Tottenham. Just look at what's happened. What's going on, Sam? What is happening to your team? >> Oh, Mo. Do you know what? Three on a bit weeks ago, I sat in the stands watching us lose to West Ham in the 90 odd minute. And I came home that night and I posted a little video on my Instagram and I was like, I'm done. I'm done now. I've supported this man. I've been nothing but loyal and I'm done with him. Because as much as I don't think that all of the problems at Spurs are caused by Thomas Frank, and I think that's proven by the amount of managers that we've had in recent years, I do think that a lot of what's happening right now is problematic in terms of or or has been problematic in terms of whether people actually follow what he's saying and his direction at the club. I mean, walking around the Bournemouth stadium holding an Arsenal mug is, you know, possibly the biggest disrespectful thing you can do to the Tottenham fan base. And in that moment, I think he lost 99% of those that were still loyal to him. And I think over the last few weeks, he's lost the players as well. Like the fact that Mickey Vanderven's having to go into his office twice and apologize for ignoring him and ranting and that's really not a Mickey Vanerven characteristic that we've seen over the last few years. So, it's been a disaster. I think they should have done it three weeks ago. I kind of understand why they've done it now though because like I said before when we were joking about PR, like we have got this period of time off now because obviously we're also out of the FA Cup. So nice window of time between the game we played on Tuesday night and then the Arsenal game, which is our fixture of gameweek 27, while they work out what on earth they're doing. And I I do think this wasn't a planned thing necessarily. I I do think the board plan to stick with him and see him through till the end of the season, but I think on Wednesday evening or Tuesday evening rather when we lose to Newcastle and we are so close now to the relegation zone like Jules joked with me on the FPL pod last week and he was like you know you're in a relegation battle and I laughed it off and then we've had two game weeks since then of which we've picked up no points and at the same time West Ham have picked up four points for a win and a Sure. And leads are picking up points and even Forest have picked up a point in the game against wolves. So those when those around you start picking up points, even if it's just a draw and you lose the potential to gain six, it becomes untenable and and they just have to do something about it. So yeah, now we're going to need a character him. I think >> why h why did it go so wrong? So I actually like Thomas Frank and I was actually rooting for him. I was hoping he would do well, but >> why? Apart from the Arsenal Cup, which I think he got done like a like he got done like a kipper there to be face. I don't think it was >> chicken. No, I know. >> But I did see a lot of Tottenham fans, even ones who are not very vocal were actually they wanted him gone. >> Yeah. >> And I was quite Yeah. It did like what happened? What's happened? >> I mean, I think in in many ways, Mo, I don't think it's his fault. like he starts the season, we were without Kulusfki, who by the way was due back at Christmas and it's now midFebruary and he's still not back. >> Um, we were without Madison who got injured in preseason. We have been without many over and it's no excuse, but we've been we start the season without the Yes. Sanki is another without our big key asset. So, we're going into the season already with a squad that feels compromised. And as the season goes on, it gets more and more compromised to the fact that we're now down to four attacking assets that are fit. That's it. We've only got four. We've got Salanki. Thank goodness Sanki is back. We've got Salanki up top. Um, we've got Kola Moani and Tell to be honest, neither of which are good enough, but they're fit, so that makes them first choice. Uh, and then we've got Javi Simmons who thank goodness seems to be finding a little bit of form and a little bit of grit and weight and desire because we really, really need it. And that's it. Even goes off injured and is now out for the rest of the season. I mean that the reports are that that's going to be somewhere between 9 and 12 months of recovery for him. Still no closer to Kulleski. Madison's still out. Kudis is out until at least the March international break and that's if we don't get another set back. So he has been fighting a losing battle for a long time. >> The January transfer window, Gallagher comes in, which in itself I think is a really interesting >> player because don't get me wrong, I love him. I think he's great. But why does he sign for Spurs? Because he's got the opportunity to go to Aston Villa. So there's at the time I thought maybe he wants to be in London. Maybe that's why. Now I'm wondering if there was something more going on behind the scenes. is like I'm wondering whether there was a conversation that says we're looking for an new appointment of manager in the summer and maybe we get one that you've worked with before in Poccino and then if you're here maybe there's an existing relationship he's also worked with Javi Simmons before um PCH so I don't know maybe it's just me you know >> looking positively on things but I think we just need to go and find an interim now and my worry is who is it going to be? >> Yeah, I know there's no there's I don't know who actually I've not even seen any names. I've seen already Nottingham and Forest another team who sacked their manager. >> Four in one season. >> Yeah, they're going to be the first Premier League club to have four managers in one season. >> Very impressive. >> Very impressive by that owner there. I have to be honest. But everyone's panicking what you said. Leeds doing well and West Ham and everyone's thinking we can't go down. So is anyone being just before we finish up with uh on on Tottenham, is there anyone being targeted for any names being mentioned for the >> for the forest job? >> No, for the Tottenham Spurs for >> now. Well, the the immediate conversation goes back to Ryan Mason again, who's been our interim three times already. Okay. >> Um had a successful time as interim the first time around. Um and actually, you know, did a really good job. Second time, not so much. Um then obviously he was sacked by West Brom in January. >> Yeah. >> Uh so he is currently unemployed. I personally don't know whether that's the right thing to do. Like at first my thought was just get Mason back. Just put it with Mason. At least he's passionate. At least he knows the club. He knows the players. He is a safeish pair of hands. I think we'd stay up under him because that's what it's come down to now. It's like who's going to keep us up. >> Um I think I think he's capable of doing that. Harry Rednap. I like that. He threw his name in the hat. Said I'll do it. I'll keep him up. Get Crouchy back. Crouch replied to his tweet. Yeah, I kind of >> He's like, \"Yeah, exactly. Wants to reunite the crew.\" Um, I think it will be somebody like that. Robbie Keane's name's been in the mix. He's currently in Hungary managing. So, there was conversation around him. I think it will be somebody like that. It will be a club person, somebody who can come in and manage the situation out for the end of the season. My gut feeling is it's potties. I think but we can't the payout for taking him ahead of the World Cup is astronomical and there's no chance that Spurs pay it. >> So, and and does PCH want to come before the World Cup? Like he's put up with a load of nonsense managing America to get to the World Cup. Yeah. >> Do you realistically walk out a few months before? >> I don't think so. So, he's gonna stick it out till after the World Cup and then I suspect they'll try and get him. That's that's what the Spurs fans want. If if they want to do something that the the fan base want, that's what they'll do. Um because I think the other managers that are out there, I I mean, they're not going to get the likes of Jave or Zabi Alonzo or they're not going to get that type of manager. They could wait it out and try and get in a battle with Manchester United for Glasgner in the summer. That's possible when he leaves Palace. Is he better than PCH back? >> I don't know. Like it all feels very unknown. >> I think we want PCH back. Anyway, as non n on Tottenham fans, I want to see PCH back in the Premier League. >> I do. I do want to see P. >> Yeah. So, I'd be happy with that. But that's that's that's enough Tottenham now. This is the most we've ever spoken about Tottenham on this pod. >> Let's move on. Let's move on. >> Honestly, but uh just before we even get into our teams here, Sam, just quickly, how's uh your gameweek 26? We know it's still going on. It's a double game week. How is it going for you so far? And how's your season in general? Just just for how's that going? >> The season's been difficult. I think that's the best way of describing it. It has been difficult. It's been one of those seasons where I feel like every couple of game weeks I take a big step forward and then all of a sudden it's like little little step back, little step back, little step back, little step back and then I'm back where I started from and then I go again. I take a big green arrow. a wild carded early a few weeks back and actually since then it's been it's been really positive. Like I've gone up 1.1 million places since then. So it's it's been a big jump in three weeks. Um this week's not going >> it's going okay. I mean I thanks to the Man City players. I had Harland's assist. I Harland's goal rather. I had Semeno and our gay. So the three of them have kind of saved the day. I've currently got free Arsenal playing. So the double Arsenal defense and Timber and Gabrielle who's got my triple captaincy because >> which is one nil Arsenal by the way. >> Yeah is one nil. >> Is it Maki who scored? Okay. Did Gabrielle get the assist? >> He did not. It was Hinki. So it was another defense. It was one of them, isn't it? That you always going to have the wrong one I think in this double. And Gabrielle's actually annoyingly been booked in this game already. So, if it's just a clean sheet that he gets, then it's going to be five. That'll be 15 going into the next round. And then we just wait and see. This is the game I'm least uh positive about. I think from a from an Arsenal perspective, it's realistically it's about the Wolves game, I think. Um, but I've also got Declan Rice as well. So, double Arsenal defense and Rice. >> Um, I don't have any Wolves, so going into next week, it will be them three. But yeah, I mean I feel like it's it's looking >> Did you triple cap him? >> I did. Yeah, I wasn't going to. >> Yeah, I I had no intention of there was no plans to do it up until about two hours before the deadline and then I thought, what am I waiting for here? So, my original plan was to, and this is rogue because I'm having such a rubbish season. And I was like, maybe I take this as an opportunity to use the triple captaincy in the blank game week in 31 and pick somebody out there and because I don't think I'll have a team of 11. I think I'll probably go into it with um 10 men. So if I use the triple cap, it gives me the opportunity to boost from there. So that was in my head that was where I was. But actually then I just thought maybe this is the right opportunity because as we get into the other doubles I'm going to want to play my bench boost probably my free hit. I'm going to run out of doubles for chips. So it's either now and it's punty or it's later in a single game week. And in the end I just thought just go now because I'm on big green arrows for the last few weeks. If this works, it would be a good it'd be a good boost and it's a good opportunity for me to kind of get further. Uh Gabrielle's currently on seven Defcon, so hopefully what we got we got half an hour left. He get three more in half an hour. So if we could get Defcon in this >> and a clean sheet, that's that's excellent. That's a great start to a double game and a triple captain. >> Yeah. So it's going all right. How's your game going? Not too different from what I read. >> Game week not very good. Season not very good. So you've come >> it's been hard. At least you've had some boost. I I don't even have boosts. Every week is just >> you can come and join AZ and I on the Q&A if you want cuz it's just it's >> it's just a disaster. >> It's a safe space to cry because AZ >> is probably in the same room as me. I mean Emma me and AZ are really um in the pits. come join us on the Q&A because I'm only ahead of him up until last week. So as and I finished gameweek 26 >> on the same points. So I've been chasing him down. So we ended up gamewe no we ended up gameweek where are we now gameweek 25 we ended up on the same exactly the same when we're sitting level. >> I'm now 15 points ahead of him after this game week. So he's raging. I'm still not happy with my rank but he's fuming bless him. So come to the Q&A with us. It's very safe space over there on a Thursday afternoon. >> Yeah, long as we're allowed to cry, I will join you lot because this season good because me and Pra, we've been crying here weekly. So, you're in good. You're in good place. Early thoughts, final thoughts. This season has been just a a difficult season. But, um, right, we're going to get stuck into it now. We're going to go into my team actually, and I might need some of your green arrow inspiration because I'm going to tell you now, Sam, have a look at this team here. It's currently not doing that well. We know it's still game week 27 26. But I'm looking ahead now. I'm going to run through my team. >> Mo, there's no reason this team shouldn't be doing well. >> But this is the thing though, Sam. Every week I look at my team with a bit of hope thinking surely should be okay. But honestly, I'm I'm at at the start I was upset cuz we're so competitive. Obviously, we do. We love FPL. We want to do good and you know, >> but every week it's been disappointment. every 50/50. All the little tight decisions and a bit of luck here and there. Don't get me wrong, there'll be bad decisions by me at times as well, but uh just being one of those just it's just one of those just one of those things. Everything that could go wrong goes wrong. That's the the honest truth of it. But uh so I'm going to take you through the team and I'll take you through some early thoughts I'm actually having happen um having so 2.8 8 million in the bank, two free transfers, Rya Ringol, Muki, who's been one of the few good signings I've had, been a super superstar, Gabrielle O'Reilly, Rice, Enzo, Fernandez, Rogers, and Wilson. And up top is Harland and Ekit. On the bench, Dravka, Keane, Raldon, and Mark Guey. So, like you said, the team in theory looks not looks not too bad. What are my pro what are my problem areas here? So, Keen disappointed me. So I'm currently in game 26. I started him and to sum up this season you saw what happened. Did you see what happened with that? Okay. He came on. He as he came on the referee blew a whistle. Literally I don't think it was 93rd minute. I just What can he do? You just have to laugh. I mean to be fair he only blocked Muki who ended up getting is it two points? >> He got two. Yeah. >> Yeah. Say it wasn't. It would have hurt if Mugi kept a game sheet. I would have been on holiday with PZ. You would have been here. I live in here by myself. I had to get a in again. >> Yeah, you would have to get a in to cover us. But um so that's the one problem area. I'll tell you what I've got with two fridge transfers and and what I'm thinking. Then you can give me some of your thoughts please. Anything you could share. So >> keen to potentially someone like a cheaper I don't mind dropping down to like Hill for Bournemouth. He's been a superstar. >> Absolutely. >> He's been and can I be honest? I nearly went there like I do a deadline stream yesterday. I'm on there. I nearly went keen to heal and I nearly done Mark Gooey to Shan Lawson. >> Oh man, >> I know I know I know right but I didn't do it thinking oh this is one of the few opportunities I can roll and maybe have to Yeah, I know it didn't work that that one day unfortunately but uh so say Keane drop him down to someone like Hill and then I'm looking at something like this maybe because I'm chasing points now. You can tell me if this is actually a good idea or not. I could potentially go Enzo to Palmer and captain him. They've got Burnley. >> That's that's early. It's very early thinking. You know, it's one of the ideas that's coming to my head. At >> one stage, I thought I was going to have to deal with O'Reilly, but it does look like he is still playing in midfield. Even though Nori's playing. We thought eight Nory coming back >> is going to finish him off, but he's still Yeah, we actually even scored this week, so that that was a big bonus for us. >> Yeah. He got He did get you 12 points, didn't he? I think O'Reilly. >> Yes, he did. Yeah, it was a lovely return. Um, >> so what do you what do you think of those moves, Sam? What do you think of those moves? >> Do you know it's it's funny because on the Q&A last week, I said I thought I didn't think Palmer was even in the top five best Chelsea assets to own. And since then, he's won well, J Pedro's won him three penalties with the three most ridiculous fouls I have ever seen. Like, they're just basically the same foul three times and it wins him a penalty. He's basically just become a pen merchant, which let's be real. That's why you buy these assets in FPL, right? Because they've won penalties and all of that. So, I get it. Um, and they've got like they've got the best fixture of the game week coming up at the weekend when they or next weekend when they play Burnley. Like that's unbelievable. The problem I sort of have for a little bit with Chelsea is after that because after that it's Arsenal versus and then it's Villa Newcastle, Everton before Man City, Man United. Like that run for Chelsea after Burnley is awful. And I think that's my slight issue with Palmer is that you got to find 10.5 million for this week. He's captainable. He looks brilliant. >> But it's one of those, isn't it, where you're kind of like, well, do I go there? Because he seems to be over the fitness issues now. He seems to be fully back to himself. Therefore, the minutes risk stuff maybe isn't there as much as it has been over the last 3, four, five weeks. Um, but after this one, the fixtures are more difficult. And I would expect that teams like Arsenal defense isn't going to give away such soft Oh, Mo, the Arsenal clean sheets just gone. >> No way. >> Oh, it has. >> Oh, don't tell me it's Thiago. >> I don't know yet. It hasn't flashed up on who it was. >> This is breaking news. >> Breaking news. Um, but I would expect the Arsenal I was just about to say I would expect the Arsenal defense to be more secure than we're going to get against Burnley. Um, so I get it. Like I get the desire for um to own him. Like I can see the fear. Have you not got like do do you want him more than you want J Pedro? So this is I'll go back to my team and I'll tell you I think I've reached the stage of the season now Sam where I'm definitely going to take a bit more risk my season I'm not going to finish where I would normally like to finish. Okay I'm at one I'm at peace with that. >> So trying to to pick captains or aggressive plays where possible. I know this uses a transfer because like you said after game week 27 goals I'm looking at my team and it it might not look look as appealing >> but I I could go Xiao Pedro. could go. I was I was actually preparing for Thiago Sam instead. >> I was preparing the features to them are great. >> Exactly that. And he's being he's been another pen machine and been playing well to be fair to him. I don't want to be too harsh on him. So I was cons that's an option as well. Although having said that, Ekit is good. So if I go Thiago, I've got to bring up Mark. Yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. Bring him up. So these are ideas in my head. But I think maybe it's just the recency bias of Palmer doing really well. And it's not just the penalties. If you watch the his matches, he he actually had a good performance in the last >> Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. >> He did have a good he did have a good performance and he's got playing with the that carrot of a World Cup spot which is very competitive at the moment. So, you're going to you're going to think he's going to want to turn it on for the remainder of the season. Maybe being sensible like you said, I could go elsewhere like Thiago and then I'm pl it's longer term moves because it is possible I go Palmer and try my luck in the captaincy and then I look to move him on to Embumo or someone else maybe. Or do you think that's a wasted transfer? Do you think I should look? >> I honestly I'm having similar thoughts with my team to be honest because I'm looking at it. I've also got Enzo who it's so frustrating because his xG numbers are still good that like the underlying data is still really good and in the last two matches he just hasn't got any points and it's like it's really annoying because you have him for this great fantastic runner fixtures that they've had over the last couple of weeks and then Palmer's back and you like in my head I keep thinking I'll bling Palmer because otherwise Enzo takes those three pens suddenly we're absolutely laughing as Enzo owners we're really ahead so It's really difficult and I think I look at the Chelsea team and I think well there's an opportunity here to to invest in somebody but then I'm also thinking more long as somebody that's already played my wild card. I'm also got to think more longer term with my team and I can't I have to be thinking about the blanking 31 and >> yes >> the the amount of Arsenal and Manchester City assets I have and how I'm managing that. So those transfers that I have have to be in some ways dealing with my gameweek 31 issues as well as the other issues that I have coming. So there is a bit of me that's kind of in the back of my head thinking well you know getting rid of because you know there are unlike your three Arsenal which is the kind of sensible way of doing it because Rya can just move to the bench and you can whether you want to play Davo or not is irre is kind of irrelevant that week like you have got a playing goalkeeper that you can play and it means you've only got two Arsenal and two Man City to deal with whereas I've got three outfield Arsenal and three outfield Man City so something's got to give there. Um, so there's part of me that's kind of thinking, well, do I if I go for another Chelsea asset, do I have to take out Enzo this week or would I keep Enzo this week? If I was to free up the money to go to Cole Palmer, am I downgrading other spots in my team where there could be some significant improvement had? Um like cuz I'm looking at the like your midfield on paper is fantastic. Um and like but realistically the bench is your issue now. Going from Keen to Hill. I've been talk which was really annoying since I wild carded I've non-stop spoken about Hill everywhere I've been and and for some unknown reason when I wild carded I decided to get Cessi instead and it's because I had the money. So I was like well I've got the extra money. Sessi's got that attacking threat. I'll just go there. That that's great. That hasn't been >> and so far so far that's going equivalent of say Muki Alen Alderete you know there's little it's exactly like that I know and it happens unfortunately through the season. Yeah, and it's so annoying, especially with the price difference between the two of them because obviously that money makes a big difference across the rest of the team. But I get I I absolutely can see why you want to go for Palmer and I can also see the appeal of him over Jal Pedro when you look at the ownership because if you're not happy with your rank like neither of us are, >> you do have to try and make some interesting and difficult decisions and like I've been without J Pedro like you have over the last few weeks. I thought I could cover it. Last week it sort of covered with Dominic Calbertt Leuen. This week I knew I wouldn't be able to cover it with Calbertt Lewin and then he wasn't even around so that was fun. Um although I had benched him anyway. Uh so >> imagine me I've kept Eatik. I've really shown faith in him apart from that one hall. He's been he's been a a bad FPL asset. He really has. He hasn't. It's unfortunate. I mean the fixtures are about to turn and he's a good player. I do rate him but he has been super frustrating if I'm if I'm honest to use an example. I've tried my best to cuz you get caught in between trying to be very aggressive and you can't change everyone every week. So you you put faith in you put faith in certain players to think I'm going to give them three or four five games >> but when I've done that this season it really hasn't materializing. He he's becoming one of those. I don't think I can move him on now. >> But my and Mo the fixtures for Liverpool are just brilliant. >> Very good. They're very very good. I'm going to bring them up. >> You look at the next like is Forest. God knows what kind of Forest. I mean, if it's Victor Pereira's forest, which is what we looked like it's going to be. I mean, I know he kept Wolves up last year, but then the opening part of the season, what did he get? Two points in 30 from 30 available. Like, and then he gets sacked from Wolves. >> I mean, they're going to play attacking football, which is what Maverinos wants. He wants them to play this attacking football. Well, mate, you had the most attacking manager in the world. Impossible. >> I was about to say, exactly. And it went so badly because the players that you have at Forest aren't they're not that that's not them. So you can bring in another attacking manager all you want, but I'm telling you now it's not going to go well. And Liverpool for all of your defensive woes in recent weeks, the attack has been really good and against that Nottingham Forest defense that there'll be goals. And then you look across the rest of it. West Ham Spurs, Brighton, Fulham, Everton, >> they're very good fixtures. And I think I'm going to just I think I'm going to leave I think going back to my team before we move on to your team. I think I'm going to leave Ekitique in for that reason. So I I can't change him, but I have got the money in the bank. It's possibility I need to look at maybe say Mark Goo to Thiago and maybe Keen down to Hill if I can afford that. In fact, I'm going to check that in a minute. If I can afford that, that might be a more sensible move. But you like you described a minute ago, Sam, it's that feeling of trying to chase now. I've probably missed the Palmer bolt now the points because three penalties in in two games or something like that. You know what the what's the probability of getting more penalties? >> Well, it depends, doesn't it, whether everyone's going to keep fouling them in the same way? Like are Burnley going to foul J Pedro in exactly the same way that they have been? Pedro going to keep falling down like like >> cuz if he is then goodness me like >> but then after that it's this week this week's the problem. Like I'm looking at a team like yours that's only got Enzo in it and I'm thinking this could be a problem. This could be a problem going into the Burnley game. But after Burnley I'm less worried about having another Chelsea asset. >> Let's uh let's segue. That was a good segue to your team. I think my team I'm there at the moment. It is early thoughts. We've still got the FA Cup games to go. Injuries could change my plans and stuff like that. But it is if I'm if I was going to say to you now Sam what moves I'm going to do. It's either Guy to Thiago and Keane to Hill. >> Okay. I think I can even do Raldon as well. If I had a feeling Keem because they did get a red card, didn't they? Is that only one game or three games? I can't remember. Is it Braveweight? Brandweight. Sorry. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. Does that mean Keane gets free game? I don't know. Maybe I'm reaching there. But so that's one option or I can go go for it and do Palmer and and so I can make that work as well. So they're they're the two moves I'm thinking about. But let's uh let's have a look at your team. Talk us through your team then Sam. >> So much like yours, it looks good. Like it it looks fine on paper. It looks like it should be doing all right. It's been doing okay since the wild card to be fair. Um Ruth with a home game I'm always happy with. Like I think if he's at home I'm happy. If he's away I'm not happy. It's a home fixture against Finland this week so that's good. Uh, I got the Arsenal double defense against my team. Who's going to be in charge at Spurs? What kind of formation are we going to play? Are there going to be any attacking assets? Who on earth knows? The one thing I will say about Spurs is that we do most of the time score. We nearly always terrible, but we do nearly always find a way to score a goal. So, the double Arsenal defense, do I want to play them both? I mean, I probably will play them both is the reality, but I could swap out for because I've got currently got Sessi on the bench against West Ham and actually maybe if I do Snessi to Hill, which is a possible option, then maybe I want to play play them in that game. Who knows? Um, Mark Gayhee against Newcastle feels like a good pick. Again, it's a home fixture. I mean, I I don't know how he only got seven this week because he was absolutely unbelievably good. >> He's excellent. Excellent player. >> Yeah. So, so good. Uh and then the midfield is not dissimilar to yours, Rice and Enzo with Fernandez Rogers and then the difference being I've got Semeno in that final spot who's been just brilliant since I've bought. >> Talk to me about Semeno, Sam, because the reason I I'm happy you've got him. He's been outstanding and he's one of those scenarios I think you touched on it earlier as well where you talk about a player I think you said it with Hill and he went Senessi. I spoke about Seno non-stop. I liked him even when he went to City. >> Did I make that transfer? No. I >> I'm not quite sure this season what my I don't know maybe I've had a bad start. He's interrupted my my transfer thinking because he's been outstanding and it's clear that they've bought him in >> to help with the mid midfield goals because it's only Holland that scores and he's been delivering. >> Yeah. He's so you must be super happy with him in your team. >> Do you know it's funny because I w I was at the Spurs Man City game a couple of weekends back and I sat there and I watched Smeno be outstanding but also selfish. So in a way that like at Man City before it was like right get the ball find Harland get the ball find Harland whoever it is Dou in the past KDB Foden however it's been it's been like get the ball get it to the big man get it to the big man get it. Semena is not like that. And there were three moments when they were shooting towards the south where I sit where Semenya takes a shot and Han is like mate at him and Semeno is just like what? Like I'm here to >> I'm here to get the golden boot. >> Exactly. >> I'm I'm not here to mess around and feed you. I'm here to contribute to this team. I'm here to win the golden boot. And in those moments I was like and that's why I bought you in because so I I had him earlier on in the season and then I sold him when those Bourma fixers got really awful and I was like well I'll lose you then and I can't even remember who I replaced him with and I instantly regretted it and then when he went to Man City and he was getting sold on mass by a lot of players when he went to Man City and that was the week I bought him back because I was just like I'm listening to what Pep's saying and I know Pep control you but I'm listening to Pep talking about, you know, how great he's going to be and how he's here to score goals and that's why they've bought him. And I'm listening to Harlon say um he's here to challenge for the golden boot. And I'm thinking if Haron's saying that I'm more like to believe what Haron says to be fair than Pep. And he's been a great buy. And part of my thinking with him was that you said before some when you're having a terrible season, you wanna salvage it, but also at the same time, you don't want to tank it. Like I don't want to finish in the I don't want to finish at 10 million. So like I've got to find I've got to find a way to get to a respectable place like somewhere inside the top million. I do not want a million plus finish. That's disastrous. So we've got to find a way to improve. So in my head therefore you take the most heavily owned and you build around them because then they they safeguard you that there's fewer people that can kill you and Lee calls it um the it's like the pain it's killing the roots to pain he calls it >> and so like for me Harl and Smeno gay he they were roots to pain not having them if they do something same as J Pedro it's painful full. So, I've had him since he was at Man City and he's been brilliant. Um, to the point where >> I can see >> I've got my eyes on him over Harland. >> I was about to say we we normally leave captaincy to the end, but I think that's we need to discuss that. So, you've actually got it on him. I'm not I'm not sure. I've got mine on Bruno at the moment, but I don't know depending on transfers coming in. If I bring Palmer, I'd of course fully commit and go for him. So, how how locked do you reckon you're you are with Semeno? And why him over Harland? If so, mine is a bit if I bring in a Chelsea player, like if if I was to bring in Jal Pedro, which is possible, I might move the armband there because it's Burnley at home and they're awful. Um, but to be honest, with the way Man City are playing, with the selfishness of Semeno, with his effort and drive and the fitness levels and the form, I trust him and I like him more. The other thing we have to consider is obviously Harlem went off at Halime. >> Yes. Yeah, we should discuss that actually. So there's a little bit of a potential worry there around minutes and injury. Now could this be a they are very comfortable in the game doesn't need to play him. There was a little bit of anxiety around him heading into the last couple of games and whether he's been fully fit. It's the FA Cup against Sulford at the weekend. Does he need to be playing Harland? No, absolutely not. So could he just give him a bit more of a rest? Maybe perfect opportunity. It feels like that rather than an actual injury to me, but maybe it is an injury we need to watch on that. But I just trust Semeno more than I do Harland right now. Plus you have the extra points for clean sheets. Plus you have the extra points for goals. The route to points with the exception of penalties feels far greater for Semeno than it does for Harland at the minute. >> Do you think you would do it if he was say flying and having a great season? Is there a little bit of chasing as well in that or not really? You don't take that into consideration. Do you think I'm I'm asking you say if he was really having a great season? Would you just go Harland and think nope a bit of defensive here to >> Yeah, that's I think I think probably I think probably there is a a part of me that is looking and going is are there opportunities to go against the grain here because Harland's always going to be the most captain because he's so heavily owned. So in the majority of casual teams and teams that aren't necessarily active, he is going to be the captain. So his captaincy rates are always going to be much higher than everybody else's. So going against him is always risky. and and I've done it a few times of late this week with the triple captaincy on Gabrielle, which isn't going great at the minute, but you know, let's see. It >> is it is still 1-1. >> It is indeed still 1-1. Uh, which is not ideal, but it's not also terrible. Um, because there is another game to go and we'll just wait and see. But I think like the the weeks before I'd gone for Bruno and that had gone really well. I' had a couple of good returns out of Bruno. I said a couple of weeks back that I um that I thought that I thought going for Semenyu was better than Harland. And actually I had um in the game against Spurs, I captained Bruno in that one, but I had the vice captain on Semenyu rather than Harlem because I just thought if if Bruno doesn't play for any reason, I want Semenyo to be to be my captain. So >> I I think there is a I think you're right. I think there is a little bit of me that's like where can I push the boundaries? Where's the best option for looking for somebody a little bit outside of the box for the captaincy? Um it's a home game against Newcastle. Like I mean >> Newcastle been struggling as well. They've they've been struggling recently. They really have. >> They have and they weren't great against Birds. It's just that we were awful. So it's not, you know, they won the game, fair enough, but they didn't win it because they were great. They won it because we are awful. >> Um, >> so I'm less, you know, I don't think that that's a turning point for Newcastle. I do think that City comfortably win that game. I expect most of the teams to have a rest in the FA Cup and for Pep to play the youngsters or or more of a youngstery squad. Anyway, >> um, yeah, >> I was going to say Sam, so looking at your team, I can I take that wild card as a success. Green Arrows and you've managed four you've got four free transfers which is a good sign. You haven't had to panic and try to patch up your wild card team which is good. >> So who are the problematic players? You've already mentioned Pedro but who are the players in your team because it has been a couple of weeks now since he wild carded. Who are the ones you're looking at? Is DC for example one or not? >> Is he a player maybe? >> Yeah I mean the fixtures aren't great. It's Manchester United, Newcastle before Burnley which is a good fixture and then it's Arsenal. So, and then Chelsea. So, the next five weeks, there's probably one fixture I want to play him in. Part of the reason for going cover at the time was that I quite liked his rotation with Krooppy because I wanted to be able to play Creepy every week. >> Um, but obviously I wild carded before Rayanne arrived. So, I think there's a slightly different narrative around which Bournemouth attacker I would prefer to have. I'm happy to hold Krooppy that like he's not an issue. I know I'm happy to have him, but I'd rather not have if I want to go into the Bournemouth attack, which I do with the fixes that they have, I'd rather it not have to be creepy and get one point like I've had this week, which is really annoying. >> So, when I look at my team, like I want rid of Rice soon. >> Yeah, you want him to go. Yeah. >> Yeah, I've had enough of Rice. I think I appreciate that Arsenal from set pieces can be brilliant, but I just feel like that's a wasted spot at the minute for the returns that we're getting from him. I know that he picks up Defcon every now and then, but we're not seeing those massive halls that we were. And even when we look back to those massive halls, I mean, one of them is a fortunate own goal headed in. One of them is a fortunate penalty given for a hand ball. >> Um, so he's picking up the assists for those. >> All right, he's taking the corners and that's why you pick him because he's on corners and it's roots points. I get that. But they've still been fortunate to have gone in from him. So, he's one that's on the topping block as is Enzo Fernandez, but he has to stay for the Burnley game. I cannot bring myself to sell a player that's got Burnley at home. So, he's got to stay for the next week. Morgan Rogers, to be honest, uh for those of you that watch the Q&A, apologies for the rant that I'm I had earlier because he drives me insane because the underlying numbers are great and I watch the games and the eye test. It's like tick tick tick tick tick tick. Great points. No, >> like >> I mean he has I mean how many blanks has Rogers have you? Have you he been harsh there? You being harsh? Let me have a look >> on the Q&A today. We did we did um I did a look at him. So over the last six game weeks, he's top for chances create for shots with 20 of the midfielders, but he is also 18th of midfielders for points scored. >> And of those, I think he's got 27 points in that six week period. 10 of them came last week. So in five weeks he's got 17 points and that came because he got an assist a few weeks ago. Like and that came in a game where he should have hauled. I remember sitting here making FPL family graphics and thinking how have you not absolutely hauled in this match like he should have had multiple multiple goals and it was absolutely infuriating not to see him get them. Um >> but look at his fixtures though Sam surely problematic. Look at his fixtures. Surely he can't be on the transfer leads Wolves Chelsea who who can see the goal and they're competing with them for a Champions League spot and Manchester United and then West Ham. They're decent. I don't think he's a he's a major issue. I mean when you look at your team I don't think he's frustrating you. So you've mentioned him. Have you got a potential plan for him to go for someone? >> Yeah. So this is the problem is that I look at the fixture ticket and he's got no red fixtures right through to gameweek 38 when they play Man City. And by that point, title race might be over and if Man City have made the Champions League final, it might be no focus for them at all on the on on the title. So, it might even be red by that stage. And if Aston Villa is still in the hunt for European football by that point, you'd expect that to be a full focus for them. >> Um, I don't think he'll end up being a priority transfer out because I think for a lot of managers, he might actually be a priority transfer in with the fixtures that they have. So, I think he's probably one that I'll end up keeping, but he's really annoying. It's really annoying to own. It is really frustrating. Um, >> would you sell rice or Rogers first? You had to pick one to go. >> It'll be rice first. Mostly also because of the blanking 31 as well that I've got to start prep for because obviously I've got the free man city and I've got the three Arsenal. So, I got six players that I've got to shift down to >> down to at least three. So, Rice will go. So, my current thinking I the one thing that I regret about my wild card is selling for inverts. and I knew I didn't want to do it. I kept so I had him on wild card and I kept him for two weeks after the wild card and he was fantastic and he was returning me points and it were differential points and it was great. But then I had to get Bruno after Man City. >> That's the reason and that's a fair enough reason. I think that's a a valid reason actually. >> Yeah. And it was a straight it was a straight choice at that point between selling Rogers or selling Bruno. And I looked at at selling Florian and I looked at the fixtures that you have versus the fixtures that Villa had. And I was like, I have to sell Vert. And as soon as I hit go on the transfer, I regretted it. And it was one of those where I was like, I'd rather sell Enzo. I'd rather sell Rice. I'd rather sell anyone else rather than Vert. But I couldn't sell either because at that point, we didn't know which one of them was going to double. So I was like, I have to keep you both. So Vertz went, but now I want to root back to him. So he he's a priority. The Liverpool fixes are just they're too good. >> They're too good. I mean, really good. Literally, if you run the fixture sticker on scout through till the end of the season, Liverpool are top. They're the only team in there that don't have any red fixtures at all between now and the end of the season. They are they are delightful. They are really, really >> playing and he's playing really well. I mean, obviously I watch Liverpool. He's an excellent player. I mean, of course, there should be more output. Same with Ekit. Very wasteful recently, but but the team is being built on Verts to be honest. He's going to be new. It is. He didn't that's why they bought him in to phase out you know the old old team of Salah and stuff and it's going to be on him and the ball is starting to go through him so I do like him as a transfer I mean maybe it's some maybe that is something I could consider actually instead of pal mom because then I could just leave him in the team with no headache >> but um >> I do like that move. >> Okay so if I pushed if I pushed you then Sam before we finish off if I did push you on your team what move are you going to do? I gave you two options. Which move you going to do if I had to push? So, I've got four transfers. There is a chance that I'd use quite a few of them. So, if I I like rice toverts. That's the transfer I'd really like to make. I do need to find some money in order to do that. I've got 1.1 in the bank. So, in order to get up, I need a and I need loads, but I do need, >> you know, I need to find a little bit because what's um rice is 7.4. Actually, I don't I could just do that transfer straight off the bat. So, I could just go rice to birds and be done with it. Use one transfer, leave it at that. Um the other option is to go and then go up from Calvat Leuen. But the question is where do I go and a bit like you do I go for a J Pedro pick but know that it's it feels a bit >> shortterm if I'm going for Burnley really. And I'm and am I just shielding myself? >> I feel like I am. I feel like that's what I'm doing. I'm just shielding myself against pain because he's in so many teams and it that's the thing that kills my rank every week. or do I take it as a more of a long-term look and do I go for somebody like Thiago because that seems like the sensible play here. The sensible move is to go straight to Thiago. It's a home fixture against Brighton who have also been poor defensively and could easily concede a number of goals against that Brighton Brenford attack and then after that they've got Burnley. So it's not like I'm, you know, over if you look at it in a two-eek block, I'm better off to go Thiago. The little bit of me goes, you've got loads of transfers, it's going to be fine. Just get J Pedro one week and then swell in the next week for Thiago and get Burnley Burnley. But that feels really wasteful at a time where transfers are important because I don't I've used my wild card >> and with gameweek 31 not too far away and you you're stacked up like you said. I think you're right. I I I think with your team albe it's a very nice team I think you do need to your moves do need to plan >> adapt they do yeah otherwise you're in danger of because you might you might use some of these transfers in a more luxury way and then two injuries or one injury then you really are in trouble you're taking a minus minus 8 minus 4 to get you you know it's kind of undoing all the good work you've done >> I mean my plan over the next couple of weeks is for Rice and Timber to go um leave me with just Gabrielle to bench because obviously I've got a lot of value invested in Gabrielle because I've had him for a while. So keep him to the bench and then either I play through double game week 30 blank gameweek 31 with 10 and keep all three of my um city assets or I have to sell one of them. But the problem with selling one of them is I have had gay for ever for like forever since he was at palace. So I've got a lot of value in gay. Yeah. >> So if I sell him, buying him back's difficult. Seno's gone up since I bought him. It's got value sitting in him as well. Got 2 in him. So don't really want Could I could I sell the big man? Like Well, let's see where we are. But you know, he's gone. I got point4 in him. So >> yeah, >> in terms of owning these city assets back, I do feel like I'm going to be 10. I'm going to be 10 men, I think, for the blank. So Rice and Timber are the priority sales. Enzo's a priority after Burnley. I think after Burnley, I'll go Enzo to Rayan. That feels like the move I'm going to make. I'll take a little downgrade there. That'll give me a bit more. >> He does look good. I mean, I didn't know much about him before. He does look really good. I was watching the extended highlights of him. My goodness. >> The habit of this. How do they do it? They pick up these players. >> Good scouting and and then they put him in they put him in a good platform to be able to express themselves. >> They'll be getting 60 million from probably Spurs. in the summer. Probably, but probably offer him 100 million. You know, we're >> Yeah, probably he he could be the one for for for next season. >> Cool. Thank you for that. I think >> was there anything else that we've missed in my team or your teams? Anything else you wanted to run through? >> I don't think so. I mean, look, Mo, our teams look like they should be getting green arrows. They should be getting green arrows. >> This season is coming. >> This season, that's not cutting it, Sam. I'm going to be honest with you. Maybe hopefully for you, I I'll wish for you. But I've already um accepted it. I'm going to try. I never give up. I'll play right to the end. But but in my mind, I'm like every week I go into it now. Like yesterday when Keane came on, I did have a chuckle. I was like, \"Yeah, come on.\" Like 93rd minute. Come on. You know, it's just one of those seasons. >> You got to laugh or you cry. >> Exactly that. But as I said, I'll be coming and crying of you as one day anyway because I need that. I need that therapy. It's a safe space. >> It's a safe space. I know in Port as is u being been being in the the mixer as well. So Sam, thank you very much for joining me on Early Thoughts. How was it? >> It's great. Can I I'll come back next time PR is uh unavailable. You know where I am. Give me a shout. >> Pra, thank you Sam. You've been a breath of fresh air every time. So listen, every uh international break, every uh FA Cup, Praz is first class obviously around the world and then so so you can come, >> you pick up the phone, I'll come as interim manager for the week. >> He's going to give me so much stick when he hears this, you know, which is why you say that for >> he's going to refuse to come back. He'll be like, \"Right, if you're going to be abusive to me, Mo, I'm out of here.\" >> No. No. It'll be >> We love you. >> Exactly. It'll be fine. Listen, if you're still listening and enjoyed it, please like, leave a nice comment for Sam. Tell me what you think of Sam's team in the comments. And um >> not Spurs. Don't tell me about them. They're terrible. >> Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry about Spurs. We know. >> I'm not going to say they could get relegated now. I don't want to rub. >> We know that, Mo. We know that. >> No. No. We're going to leave that. So, but yes, we will see you. I'll be back next week with Praz for final thoughts and um we see Sam again soon. So, thank you very much. Take it easy to buy from me >> and bye from me.",

[music] [music] [music] [music] >> [music] [music] [music] >> Hey, [music] [music] heat. Hey. Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to your Q&A ahead of game week 27 sort of where it's sort of in [laughter] the tail end of 26 and then there's a week break and no one really knows what day is a bit like Christmas isn't it? No one really knows what day is in terms of PLY anymore. When are the games happening? When are they happening? Who knows? Uh you are joined by myself and Sam. We are both on Red Arrows. I was surprised to see when I read Aran because I thought you'd having quite a good week and then I checked your rank and it had gone down and I was like, \"Oh god, no wonder mine's gone down so much.\" >> It was worse on Tuesday evening because of course I've got the wrong Chelsea player. I don't have J. >> Oh, this is a good start, isn't it? I don't have J Pedro. I don't have Palmer. I have Enzo. I was like, \"Oh, he's gone badly.\" >> You don't you don't have Palmer. You mean the fifth the the fifth sixth best Chelsea asset in the in the team. >> We're still just a pen merchant. He is. [laughter] >> It's just a pen merchant. That's all that's happening here. Is that Pedro? If you honestly, if you >> I don't know if you listen to this week's official podcast, but I just ranted on that about how if people stopped giving away stupid fouls on J Pedro when he was going nowhere, this wouldn't have happened. >> It's unbelievable. It's absolutely unbelievable. Yeah, >> particularly in that Wolves game like J Pedro's going nowhere. He's literally going nowhere. Three times. Three times. And then last night or Tuesday night, the same thing happened again. >> Three penalties for the same foul. >> Stop it. What's wrong with you all? That's a foul. Don't do it. And it's really And as an Enzo owner, >> it's even more infuriating cuz it's like if if Co's [laughter] not there, he takes the And I know that you buy the pen takers in FPL for all of those reasons, but I honestly the fact that J Pedro had the same foul on him three times in a week has royally irritated me. >> Yeah. You know what? I didn't want Enzo. And there's nothing worse in FPL. I think when you buy a player that you don't really want. I couldn't really get to anyone else cuz I already had my three strikers. I couldn't really get to Pedro. Couldn't really afford Palmer. So, I got Enzo just as like the the best of what I could get to. Didn't really want him. And then I watched him blank. And I'm like, I didn't want him. I could have avoided that. I know. >> Yeah. And the best thing I mean, should we tell everyone about the little bit of bounce that we had on Friday night? >> Was it bounce or was it you just being really mean? [laughter] Yellen. Look, literally you sent me basically I I sent Sam a message saying, \"Oh, turns out Cole Palmer was quite a good option. You're wrong about that.\" >> Yeah, but that wasn't the first way it started. It started on that was on Saturday. That on Friday night, it started with you saying, \"I didn't want Dominic Calvin to get you any points.\" That's how it started. So, it started with you giving me grief. >> Yeah. >> So, then when you messaged about Cole Palmer, I thought, \"I'm not taking it.\" So, what did I do? just sent me a picture of Calvin Leuen and then not even not even any like commentary with it, just a picture of him and literally I threw my phone across the room and then I went bit harsh from Sam in it and I was like I love that a picture of Dominic Caluin can be considered as a harsh reply [laughter] to something. Um, >> I know. And like the thing is like I was like, Lee was like, \"Why have you just sent him a picture of Dominic Calvin Lewin?\" And I was like, \"Well, because he was rude about DCL cuz honestly on Friday night we were have we were having dinner when Dominic Calv scored the four of us. And the way that I sit at dinner, my back is to the TV. So the game was going on behind. I wasn't that bothered uh until I could and so all I could hear was the commentator going Dominic Calvin in.\" And I was like, \"Yes.\" [laughter] And then you >> I thought I could cuz you were talking about selling him. So I was like, \"Maybe I can escape with you having like two or three blanks from him in a row. That would be perfect. Then you'll know my pain.\" >> Yeah. >> You actually got a seven pointer from him. That really annoyed me. >> Yeah. And actually because I was really up in Let's talk about last game week because that was good. I was really up in the air about what to do with him because I wanted to play him but also wanted to get Jal Pedro. And actually last week it pretty much leveled out. Jed got eight, he got seven. I was like, well, to be honest, I've saved a transfer and I feel all right about this. Um, but yeah, look, gameweek 25 was really kind to me. I had another 300k green arrow. So, actually, we were on the same points, weren't we, by the end of gameweek 25. >> We were on exactly the same points. >> Yeah. And I was the same points. feeling really positive because that had been I'd gone up like what in two weeks about 850k maybe a bit more than that actually about 1.1 I think in the end because it was 800k the week before and then 300k so about 1.1 million I'd gone up or down however you want to look at it um in those two game weeks and I was like yes now this week I've got my triple captain active as >> well so have I we got we got exactly you're you're 15 points ahead of me now and you will remain >> how bad is week going. >> You will remain. I'm on 20 points this week. >> Oh, my darling. >> I haven't got any I haven't had anyone do anything. Munos bought him in this week. One pointer against the worst team in the league. Fabroen concedes in the last minute again. Not the last minute, but close to last minute. >> I bet you were raging last night. >> H then bloody Tarovski doesn't even get Defcon. One one away from Defcon against Bournemouth. You know, Fernandez blanks, Enzo Blanks, Echit. I wasn't expecting a huge amount of him against sudden but maybe he played well maybe something >> there was a couple of opportunities >> oh it's just bad just bad again then you got to watch all the semeno owners and karma owners and >> oh just really frustrating game really really frustrating game and yeah I'm now down to 2.9 million which is about where I was in game week >> oh in in gameweek 13 I was 2.6 6 million. So I'm now below where I was in gameweek 16 >> just just I just hate the seasons. I hate it so much. I just can't just cannot I looked at >> I looked at my team this week. I just people don't know this is a Q&A. We'll come to this was my team this week right Gabrielle Timber Fernandez Enzo Rice Anderson Thiago Harland Ecat. How does that team get 20 points and a red arrow? Like >> it's just >> bloody hell. People buy a 3.9 million B of defender nine points. >> The amount of people that have messaged me to say thank you for the hill and he's gone up to four now, hasn't he? because I think I've said so many times James Hill I've got my um Thursday chat active over on my Instagram at the minute and all the questions on it are either what the hell's going on at Spurs and what do you what are you going to do next or they're like where are all the points this game week or they're people saying thanks for James Hill because he's been incredible and I'm sitting here with Sessi going why the hell didn't I just do Sessi to James Hill >> I know >> but anyway even Max like my youngest my oldest He brought in James Hill this week, nine points. >> Yeah, it's so easy. It's such, oh, Palmer's playing leads and Burnley at home. He's probably quite a good player to bring in this week. I'll just bring him in. Not all this overthinking. Yeah, but his minutes might be managed and he's only taking penalty and all this stuff. It's like, yeah, he did quite well last week. James Hill, yeah, he's 3.9 million. He was playing in the game. Yeah, he's doing all right. I'll bring him in. >> Yeah, my I mean to be fair, my game week this week has been saved by the three city players. >> Yeah, >> cuz I I had Semeno Harland and Gayhei. So, I mean, all right, it wasn't Nico Riley levels, but th those three returns are because I've got I had Crooppy, who came on for a one-point, didn't start. It's just annoying. Uh Bruno with nothing for the first time in five weeks. So, that's just that was what it is. Rogers, I I want to throw him away. >> Honestly, I'm more annoyed with him than I am with with Enzo because at least Enzo's numbers are still there. At least the xG is still there. At least he's still involved. It's frustrating as hell, but it's still there. Whereas Rogers, like honestly, I think I would have sold Rogers this week were it not for the fact that he returned last week. So, it's just one of those annoyances. But then I had Roose who conceded an own goal, but actually did a fantastic job. And I don't really know how we didn't get multiple save points cuz I thought Roose was brilliant in the game against Liverpool. But alas, we are where we are. I'm on 35, free to go tonight. the same as you, Timber Gabrielle, who's my triple cap, cuz I last minute changed my mind on that. I got I definitely got FOMO and I sort of regret it. >> The Thiago goal is going to hurt in it. >> Yeah, [laughter] >> because I benched him this week. >> Yeah. And then I've got Rice obviously as well who's going to do nothing, but maybe if Sack is back that makes Gabrielle >> better. >> Yeah. >> Who knows? >> Yeah. >> We will find out tonight. Green arrows by the end of this week. >> Yes. >> Yes. I just I'm 25 points away from a green arrow. So, I'm not totally sure what's going to happen, but >> I'm not sure I'm that far away from a Green Arrow, Mark. >> No, you can't be You can't be far. You can't be far. >> Have a look on live FPL, but I don't think I'm that far. I think I need What's my safety score? Seven. I'm seven away. >> Yeah, you're >> six away. I'm six away, so I should be all right. >> You'll get a green. Yeah. Okay. >> How's everyone in the chat? We've ignored you for the last 10 minutes. Um, obviously much uh much pain is being caused. Uh Schworner has got rice captain Timber and Gabrielle. Yeah, I'm seeing a few Rice captains. Triple captain rounds. Yeah, Tom Flanigan is on 62 points with triple captain Gabrielle Reya and Rice to go. >> I mean, that's nice, isn't it? >> Tripled my score this week >> and still has three to go. >> Oh my god. E Mackhams on 29 points. Rice, Gabrielle, and Yakarez. Uh no triple captain. I guess you'll be praying for a even though you own two. Um, no, you only got you've only got one last defender. Yeah, you'll definitely be hoping for a Thiago goal then. >> Definitely will. >> Um, say is very negative. Come on, guys. You can do this. I can't. Sam can. I can't. >> No, you can. As you can. You can. We're doing it. Remember, we're doing this together. We're in it together. No, don't give up. Because now we we're doing it together. This not this weekend because there's no football. But I will only send you positive pictures of players from now on. I promise not to send any more Dominic Cavaloo images. >> Dominic Cavaloo broke me. >> I'll just send you I'll send you positive images of players from now on. [laughter] I don't know what they'll be doing. Probably not scoring us any points, but I'll send you positive. >> Our teams are different as well. So, because obviously the wild card has been really good for you. I think you've got lots of team value. It's Yeah, it's good. Um Shauna says Vertz is a keep. That's the one player you didn't keep. You didn't keep Vertz. No, but he he is the So the transfer I was going to make this week was to do Sessi to James Hill, but I would have benched Hill like I did Sessi. So it would have just so I wouldn't have got his nine points and then Rogers to Vvertz. However, I decided not to do it in the end and just give Rogers another week. Um because Liverpool I was like, \"Oh, it's away at Sunderland. Sunderland are good defensively. Like I don't see Liverpool scoring loads of goals, so I'll just let it play for a week.\" Whereas Rogers against sorry, but against Brighton I was a bit like well who knows what kind of Brighton side is >> I was amazed he didn't get anything he didn't get anything against us. I thought he >> so I kept him for that but that is my plan is definitely to bring Vert back. Um I got four free transfers now as well so I'm in the uh >> Wow. >> Yeah I've rolled since my wild card I've not made >> again another advantage. >> Yeah. Um Indie Bares I think were overthinking it on Palmer. He was the best player on the pitch by country during the week. He might have worked out to manage his injury whilst he played when you got four transfers. Is there any temptation to get Palmer for this Burnley game? >> Yeah, there is definitely and it's >> there is some there is a way. Well, the problem is is that now he's now he's fit. So, in the past we had the well, Enzo's on pens if he's not playing and if he's going to miss every other game through injury, then every other game I get the benefit of having the penalty taker at Chelsea for next to no money. So, but now Palmer seems to have played his way back into fitness and he seems to be all right and and all of that jazz and the fact that the fixture congestion is not easing because the Champions League is obviously coming back in, but it's not quite as as bad as it has been over December and and January. Maybe we're in a place now where I can start looking at it again. The slight issue I have is that the Chelsea fixtures after Burnley, they're not as nice. like it was these block of fixtures that was the ones to to own them for. >> Um >> like I think so I I don't think I'll go there with Palmer like it's something to consider. I think I'm more likely to get J Pedro to be honest than I am because I think it's becoming when I wild carded it wasn't clear whether it was going to be J Pedro or Liam Dilap. >> It's become very clear. Yeah, it's become very very clear that it's not Liam Dilap it's J Pedro. So, I will almost certainly go um go for J Pedro instead. I think that's probably the way I'll play it. >> I guarantee as soon as everyone buys a J Pedro, his goals are going to dry up. He's he's a frustrating player, but if you've got on him for these last four or five games, then well done cuz >> you know his match uh when was it? Tuesday night. He I just realized I'm streaming with the door open. You just see a child. >> I just saw I just saw a figure just walked past it. >> God. Good. Oh, they're waving from the stairs. >> [laughter] >> small child. Um I I always shut my door when I stream in case they're noisy. Good job they haven't been. Um did you know J Pedro had more shots in the game on Tuesday night than he's ever had in a Premier League match in his time at Watford or Chelsea on Tuesday night? >> I did not know that. >> No, that's new like seven. Very very impressive. So yeah, >> I don't know. Look, maybe it ends. But at the moment he's getting good service. He's winning penalties because people just keep hacking him down. Yeah. >> Um, you don't have any of the risk of him missing the penalty either, which is kind of nice, isn't it? Like I don't know. Um, I think I probably will go there. It to be honest, it's like him. Cole Palmer's not hurting me. Cole Palmer would be a great movement piece, >> but J Pedro hurts. When J Pedro returns, it hurts your rank. So that there's got to be a check and balance there. like >> creeping up now, but he's he's still he's 15% owned. Pedro's 50 50% I think. >> Yeah, he's he's he's a highly highly owned player and and that really does hurt you if he doesn't return. >> You're all about the the protective the protection, aren't you? Not about the >> not about the risk. >> Well, no. I think there's a balance to be had. Like I think you you like going to verts away from Rogers and to verts that's different and and I'll do the same with the Enzo Rice picks. I think I'm gonna go for Rayanne Bournemouth. >> Yeah, fixtures. I think Rice to Rayanne is is on the cards um as well. Enzo to somebody else. I'm not quite sure. Like I'm I think I've all my management style has always been have a spine of heavily owns that protect you and then around them have the differentials that build. I >> I think you'll be regretting J Pedro though after Burnley. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Everton, Man City. The >> I don't doubt that. The question for me is do I because my kind of thought process at the moment is I'm going to want Thiago back at some stage. I know that that's going to happen. So, do I go Pedro for Burnley and then switch to Thiago straight after or do I just accept now that I've gone without J Pedro for this long and that's where we are? >> Yeah, it's it's you just got to get through this Burnley game. But >> yeah. >> Yeah. I'm pretty move this week [laughter] >> cuz I've got Verbugen. He's been absolutely bloody useless like. >> Yeah. You don't really want to play D Broka against Chelsea. Do you? >> I do not. It was Veren. I mean away at Brenford. It's not awful, but I still expect Brenford to score in that game. >> The trouble is there's not really any massively I the goalkeepers are awful. >> I think you get you get Keller now. Right. I think right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right until the end of this I mean they play Man City and Liverpool away that's right at the end of the season they've got some pretty good home games as well between now and then so I think Keller's probably in and then stays unless unless you're going for Rya >> um >> yeah you're probably right >> you probably go for that um I've just realized we have got a sponsor for this stream we have >> that we need to talk about and it's a very interesting sponsor this one not our normal uh bread and butter but yeah talk us through it [snorts] >> uh yes so this episode is being brought to you by the British Army recruitment Now, you might know how exciting and challenging an army career might be. You also might be wondering, \"What's in it for me?\" On this episode, we all love sport. We love football. And I'm sure that if you're listening to us, you do, too. You might not know this, but sport is built into your day-to-day army life. You don't have to squeeze football into your evenings, and most bases reserve Wednesday afternoons just for sport. You can play rugby, football, cricket, basically any sport you can think of. The Army is part FA affiliated with its own teams competing across the country. And they'll even fund your qualifications and courses to the highest level if you want to become a professional coach or a referee. So it's not just playing, you're developing, too. Plus, while you're doing all of that, you're being paid to train in new skills, get civilian qualifications up to degree level. And away from sports PhD, Army's the UK's biggest apprenticeship provider and the number one apprenticeship employer as listed in the Sunday Times. So, if that sounds like your kind of team, search army jobs to find out more. >> Well, look at that. I bet not too many people were expecting a advert from Rich Army, but here we are. >> Uh, lovely stuff. Well handled, Sam. Uh, you've definitely got a, you've definitely got a role in some kind of online [laughter] sales at some point. I can definitely see the, you know, the transition over to QVC or one of [laughter] other shopping channels. >> Imagine available on the shopping channel like in that episode of The Apprentice. [laughter] >> I'll be there with like a blowup flamingo or something. Yeah, that's what the people want. Absolutely. [laughter] >> Uh JC says, \"Any interest in Hammers assets?\" Somerville has been good for a while, hasn't he? >> Yeah, he has. And I think in the past it had to be Jared Bowen, didn't it? If you were investing in West Ham, it had to be Bowen and that was the end of it. Whereas now, it's not just Jared Bowen, it's Jared Bowen. Somerville is looking good. To be fair, even the cheap like and I think I said last week, oh, you could go Aaron Weber Saka, but no real like oomph to it because I wasn't really expecting any clean sheets, especially against Manchester United. Like I was not expecting them to be holding a clean sheet right until the very end of that game. But they have turned a corner. Like they are the form team in the league. I think they're going to get out of it. >> I think they will get out of it. But like we were say like when when they lost to >> they were dead and buried. >> I know. Absolutely >> dead and buried. Yeah, >> they were dead and buried. It was I tell you what it was. It was bloom and Dr. Tottenham again, wasn't it? They came to the Tottenham Hotspad. They get a win right at the death and since then they're picking up points now to go and take points off Manchester United in the form that they've been in since Carrick arrived is very impressive. And right up until the end of that game, I genuinely thought they were getting all three points. Um so and the fixtures look like they look decent enough to get them out of trouble. So, it's Bournemouth at home up next before traveling to Liverpool. That's difficult. Um, but even then, Liverpool concede like they do concede goals. There's not been big halls in the Liverpool defenders apart from Virgil last night, but there's definitely goals that could be scored there. After that is Fulham, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Wolves, Palace, Everton. Like, there's definitely goals in that for West Ham. And there's a few clean sheets in there along the way as well. Like if you want to go for Aaron Wasaka as your cheap fifth defender. I do not hate that between now and the end of the season. I like the Somerville pick. I like the Jared Bowman pick if you've got that money to splash around up top. I I think there is I think you have to look at West Ham. You have to follow the form and we always say invest in the teams that got something to fight for and they've got every chance of getting out of this. If I told you that after losing to Wolves 3-0il and then losing at home to Forest, it would actually be Shan Dich sacked who then went on to win I think three games in that run over the over the same period. Like what has the Premier League is a bloody weird league, isn't it? Like it's it's amazing how quickly things can turn around. I mean, you take if they hadn't conceded that last minute goal to Chelsea, they'd be looking at four wins in a draw in five games since that Forest >> Yeah. >> result. Like, that is that is crazy. And they've got a good squad. Like, I I think the West Ham squad is better than the Spurs squad. And you know what? The signings that West Ham made in the window have been really good. They've added to the They've added to the squad in a really positive way and positions that have allowed Jared Bum to play in the position he actually wants to play in. I think West Ham, credit to them because they could have panicked and sacked Nuno a few weeks ago when they were looking dead and buried. They didn't. They've trusted the process with him. They invested in the players that he wanted and needed in the January window. And as a result of that, they're on the climb like and I think you know there are teams to you're not going to invest in Burnley in reality despite the win against Palace last night. You're not going there. I don't think you'd really go wolves either. People that have got wolves have really only gone there because of the double game week that they have this week despite the Jose Hall that he got last night and Mascara as well. But you're not really investing in there from now on, right? Especially with the blank coming up. But West Ham genuinely feel like the team to target from a buy them perspective in that bottom rung of the table because it's so tight down there. like your team, my team, Forest, like there's a load of us. Palace, if they don't start picking up consistency, there's so many teams in that kind of bottom half of the table where if West Ham keep winning, any of them could drop. I can't I can't believe I completely agree. We are in a relegation battle and I cannot believe it because a month and a half ago, I would say we had a decent shot of Europe and then we've lost I think we've won in 13 games now. We being Brighton for anyone who's who's wonder I mean it's is an absolute joke. >> Um I mean if if West Ham had won against Manchester United like you said two points between you and you and them. >> I know it's ridiculous. >> Absolutely. >> It's absolutely mad and and like we are [sighs] I mean I'm doing final thoughts later. I'm going to record that with um with Mo tonight mostly so we can talk about Spurs. So if you want my in-depth thoughts on Spurs, go give that a listen tomorrow when it's out. But it's mad that we've got ourselves into this position and I I think there are genuinely this year Wolves and Bernie go. It's just who's the third and West Ham are going to get out of it. I'm absolutely convinced that the Hammers will be safe because they they are they've got the momentum. They've got and they've got the belief within the squad and I think they they're backing the manager. They're behind him. They see the goal and they're working towards it. like the hard work that that went into that game against Manchester United like SUK was unreal in that game. Absolutely unreal like years ago. Sutek when we all had him in FPL like yeah I'm really impressed with West Ham. So yeah, Somerville is will likely come in as one of those midfielder options because I do like the fixtures. I think the fixtures are good for goals. >> I mean if West Ham stay up, if we if we say they're going to stay up, I'm not quite as confident as as you are. But let's let's say in this reality that that West Ham do stay up. Who goes down then? Because realistically it's between >> Well, I thought it was going to be Forest until they sacked Dish. >> I I I would I would say realistically, and this is going to sound crazy, realistic, it's between Spurs and Forest. >> Yeah. Well, I think that's why they did what they did last night >> cuz I think Palace, Brighton, and Leeds will have enough to to pick up wins. But I look at Spurs and Forest at the moment, and I just really wonder where those wins are going to come. >> Well, the problem is as we have no fit people. We've got four attacking assets. That's it. So, we've got Domanki, Kola, Moani, Tell. Who's the one I've missed? >> None of those players are good. >> Domanki is good. >> Okay, Slank is good, but Teland and Mayani are >> No, they're terrible. Um, I can't think who the other one is now. >> Oda Bear's out now, isn't it as well? >> OD's out to the He's done for the season. The only hope we've got is when Cudas comes back, but he's not due back until the March international break, and that is too late. >> Oh, you're in big trouble. >> It is too late. We've loaned out Dane Scarlet. Who the hell understands why we did that in January? I do not understand. Why on earth have you loaned out a a He's good. Why have we loaned him out? We haven't got enough players. Why the hell? And I said it at the time, why are we selling Brennan Johnson in January? We had a problem just because Frank didn't like him. I'm sorry, but Brennan Johnson is exactly what we need right now on the right hand side. He's a safe pair of hands. He was our top goal scorer last season. He is exactly the sort of player that we need in Oh, Zabi Simmons is the other one. >> You'd be looking to sign him if uh if [laughter] it was >> 100% >> not playing at Palace and his new club and get him in. Honestly, it is a disaster. The fact that our two top goal scorers are our center backs. And by the way, one of them is now suspended for another three matches because he's an idiot. Um, and the other one is top quality and just a bit of a legend. But honestly, the squad is in disarray. There's nobody fit. Who the hell they get as an interim coach between now and the end of the season? >> We're not at the club anymore. So, I honestly think that that's what they would have done. I mean, he has been fired from West Brom, so we could go and get him. >> Oh my god. If you get Ryan Mason back, that would be so funny. >> But it would not shock me as it would not shock me if they announced that. >> You're going to give it You're going to give it It's going to be Rednap or Sherwood or someone like that. It's going to be one of like the >> They were talking about Robbie Keane >> for the for the rest of the season. >> Is he Is he managing on like Australia or something like that? >> He's married. Yeah, he's managing abroad at the minute. I don't exactly know where he is, but he is managing abroad and it's going all right apparently. But he's not who's giving up a job to come and do an interim job at Spurs when we might get relegated till the end of the season. >> You're not, are you? >> He's managing He's managing in Hungary at the moment. >> So that's I mean that sounds like a bold [laughter] take Robbie Keane out of Hungary and make him manager of a team with no players fit. You might as well start him. >> He could start himself like >> get the guns out. There was a um >> we done an army ad be good appropriate for the Robbie Keane celebration. [laughter] >> Have you seen the um the meme that's going around? It's of Harry it's Harry Rednab on the phone and he's like it says above it it's like crouchy domain >> crank jar. Yeah. Yeah. >> Like we're coming out of we're getting the gang >> as crouch replied to it. Didn't he was like I'm ready. [laughter] >> I'm ready. Yeah. I mean I'm in for it. Can we sign? He's free. He's a free transfer, right? We can sign. Genuinely we are in big trouble. your your best chance of staying up is with this Veto Pereira appointment for Forest because I I don't I don't like that appointment at all. Like you you don't you don't take out Diet who's been in this fight for pretty much all his life and give it to Pereira. I know he did well with Wolves last season, but he managed 10 games this year for Wolves and didn't get a single win. >> No, >> there's no guarantee that he comes in and does anything remotely. They should have they should have stuck with Dich. I think that is such a bad decision getting rid of him. I'm not surprised with everything that's going on with Forest, but what's that mean for Anderson, do you reckon? Honestly, who the two clubs are in disarray >> and we should have known it at the beginning of the season when they were arguing about Morgan Gibbs White >> at that point. We should have gone these two clubs have got a problem. The fact that they're arguing with each other is ridiculous. >> Now they're in a relegation fight together. >> Now they're both fighting. I mean, Morgan Gives White is on the pitch looking like, \"What the hell am I doing here?\" Like, and if you look at the squad when they're fit, both of these squads, these are not squads that should be in the relegation battle. They're not. These are these are teams that should be mid-table, but they have been so badly managed. Like, I am firmly of the belief that the Spurs board without Levy have got no backbone >> and that they've gone, \"Okay, well, let's just get through to the end of the we won't get relegated. let's get through to the end of the season and then we'll talk to PCH. I genuinely believe that's what they were doing and he'd have got sacked in the summer and the World Cup would have ended and Poch would have come home. >> I genuinely believe that that's what they were doing and instead what's happened is somebody's gone into them after Wednesday night or Tuesday night's game and gone, do >> you know we're very close to the relegation zone and we've got no fit players and we've just sold Brennan Johnson and our captain has kicked off and now got suspended. Um, I think we have to change something. And they've gone, we can't buy any players. We can't shut Romero up unless we shoot him. Uh, so let's sack the manager because it's the only thing we've got left to do. Chaos. [laughter] It's absolute absolute chaos. I don't know what's going to happen. I mean, it's all relevant for FPL because I think at the moment we've got to be targeting like teams playing those teams and and actually I agree with you. West Ham probably aren't the team to talk a bit like when Wolves had that bit of a resurgence for a bit. I mean now again they're looking a bit a bit shaky and um you know I wonder what you know you got I've got Munoz next week so I'm pretty happy with that. >> Strand Lson for people who who adopted him early will be will be happy but there was a period wasn't there where the defensive numbers were good they were playing better West Ham are sort of in that period a bit now it can turn around very quickly but I think Spurs and and Forest at the moment got to be teams that you that you target. Um, Somerville or Rayanne says British 87. Let's bring it back to FPL respected >> players. Both. You put both in your midfield. I don't believe you do that. [laughter] There is a draft on my phone [snorts] that loses Enzo and Rice and Rogers for Vert, Somerville, and Ryan and then has them and has the money to upgrade Dominic Calbertt Leuen to Thiago. Okay. And I like it a lot. >> Somerville and Ryan. That seems >> But the thing is, as you don't have to play them both every week. >> True. >> The bre the Bournemouth fixtures are nice. So Bournemouth. So the difficulty is in 27 they play each other. >> But >> I mean either pick a side or just play them both and see what happens. After that Bournemouth have got Sunderland but Sunderland away like Bournemouth are at home. So Sunderland are very different if they're home in a way. So I don't mind that before Brenford come to them. Brenford are the same. They're not so great away from home. Burnley and then Manchester United before Arsenal. But then after that, Newcastle leads Crystal Palace. Like that is a run of fixtures that I want to be able to pick a Bournemouth player and play them every week. It's part of the reason I got Cessi, although I'm going to swap him for Hill. Um but I can't be certain that Kroo is going to play every week. So, Kroo is a problem from that perspective because, [clears throat] >> you know, I started him this week and then he comes on for a one-point cameo. Whereas with Rayanne, >> I do think he'll play every week because of the position that he's been brought into play. There's good potential to move around with Krooppy and Evan Nilson and the attack, but Ryan feels important. West Ham again, the fixtures look nice. Um, so obviously Bournemouth next before Liverpool, Fulham, Man City, the Liverpool Man City ones. So if over the next four weeks you didn't want to go there I'd understand it but after that Villa Wolf Crystal Palace Everton Brenford that is definitely a run you can invest in. >> I prefer Ryan to Somerville in terms of the fixtures but I do really love the momentum that West Ham have. >> I like uh I I I prefer Ryan over over some of I think just just given the fixtures the fixtures for Bren um for uh Bournemouth are so nice. The other one is Dango that a few people are mentioning. Um Craig >> surely Dango worth a shout BT1 with >> um Thiago though. I don't know if >> Yeah, I think I would >> double up on the Brenford attack. >> I think so. I mean they've got Brighton, Burnley, Wolves all in the next four. >> They'll they'll score plenty of goals over those three fixtures. They're they're a very good attacking side. >> Even after that [clears throat] it's Leads, Everton, Fulham. >> I know. Bournemouth in 29. I mean that's not it's a really really good run. I I I I would be very tempted. I think I'd still I think I'd still go for um uh the Bournemouth guy. What's his name? Ryan. >> Ryan. [laughter] >> I think I'd go Rayanne first and then Dango, then Somerville. >> That would be my three. >> Yeah, [snorts] I don't hate that. >> Yep. Col says Somerville and Ryan might work. You just need an exit strategy. That's the good thing. You have got >> There's loads of exit strategies. That's the point. >> Players around six million who are who are looking. >> And worst case scenario, just go back to Elliot Anderson in his Defcon if he still gets them. >> Yep. Well, that that is what that is generally what I'm a little bit worried about. I mean, he he was unlucky at the start of the season when it was noon. I think he hit 11 what, three weeks in a row or something like that. Um, so he was right he's right up there. He'll continue to get it, but he's obviously playing in a role which pretty much guarantees him them every week under D. I was really annoyed because he's been he's been my only good player this [laughter] season. >> He's he's been amazing for me. I bought him before West Ham in 21 and he's averaging five points a game. It's so I'm so happy with that. It's been It's been great owning him. >> Look, you've got a smile on your face for the first time. >> I know. I know. I do wonder though if now is the time to move him on to a Dango or a um Oh my god, I forgot his name again. Ryan, [laughter] I can't remember Ryan. >> Why can't you remember him? >> I don't know. Sorry, Ryan. I think you're great. Um Enzo to Rayan Wilson or Dango says Nemana. I mean, you can't sell Enzo this week, can you with Bernie at home? You got to give him one more week. >> You've got to give him another week. Yeah. Um, but I would do Ryan first and then then Dango. I'd put both of them ahead of Harry Wilson actually. >> Yeah. Um, I've seen this mentioned a few times actually. Tom Flanigan says, \"Planning Rice and Palmer out for Salah and Dango in 28.\" I've seen a few people lining up Palmer Palmer to Salah. >> Yeah, I've seen it. >> Salah, >> don't do it again. Sam, don't you know, sixth best Liverpool asset and all that. >> Fixes are good. >> Fixtures are very good. And he's got pens, isn't he? That's the thing. But but I love Verts. >> Yeah, >> I love Verts. I love Did you see that beautiful little tip he sent over to Sally yesterday? I was like, \"Oh, that is delightful.\" He's just so lovely and he plays such great football. He's a pleasure to watch. And I just think because he's so involved, he gets the bonus points anytime he does anything. So, I really like Vert. I can't work out whether I think that Salah is actually worth >> the money over having verts and neck because you could you can get fairly close to having both of them for not far off of Salah's price. >> I would definitely go for verts over seller. I wouldn't even there's >> I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't write off Salah it's seller but I just think vert is is perfect. Absolutely perfect for what we want. What I really need I really really really really really need to be watching Liverpool with my husband who will be back from Vegas by then absolutely spank Nottingham Forest and send them down cuz that will save my club. Y >> with verts getting a hatful. That's what I really need. >> Imagine how happy I'd be. >> My FPL team's got gonna have verts in it by then. I've got loads of points. I come on here. It's a green arrow. His spurs are saved. Sorry Forest. You've become the sacrificial lamb. Uh, but that's just that because I don't want your team to go down and my team I obviously don't want my team to go down. So, Forest, it has to be you. Um, because I don't even want the Hammers to go down. Like I as a Spurs fan, I should want them to go down, but I really like Jared Bowen. >> Yeah. I mean, Mark Mark abandoned me on Blackbox, didn't he? So, >> yeah. Well, stop Mark. He left us. >> We're going I know. We're go we're going to the uh the game the Brighton Forest game. >> Oh, I hope you win. I mean genuinely if we lose that game we are in massive trouble. Like >> where are you? How far away from relegation are you? >> We we two points more than you. >> Oh, is it that close? >> Yeah, we're on 31. We got 31 points and Forest on 27. So if Forest beat us, >> we're going to be one point ahead of them. And if West Ham win, >> that is >> you could get sucked back in as >> if we if we lose to Forest and West Ham win, we are seriously in we are we're just in it. We're just completely in it. And if we got relegated, that would be like the worst thing that could happen. [laughter] I know every club says that, but it would be really bad. Really bad. >> Genuinely, I'm looking at the table. Anyone from I think Fulham are safe. Anyone from Palace down? Yeah, >> I mean Pal's losing at home to Burnley and all the Glas stuff. >> Oh, I know. And the but these are like I'm not being funny, but like Palace, Brighton, Spurs, the West Ham, like even Wolves. These are like established Premier League sides. These are not teams that we would have at the beginning of the season, I did not have Wolves in the bottom three. >> No, I don't think I did either. I I did I did a league table. I don't I don't think I did either. like you I fully expected the bottom three to be the promoted clubs and maybe somebody slips down out of the others. In fact, I think I thought that Brenford were going to have a shocker because of the embomo style. >> I had I had I had Brenford, Burnley and Sunderland. They were my three. >> I I definitely had Brenford in the relegation zone on FPL Family when we did that stream. Definitely I did. >> I thought leads would stay up cuz I thought they had the best squad. I thought all the all the um signings suddenly made would take time to gel and they just didn't. They've just been absolutely unbelievable all season. Fair play to them. >> They're safe. I think I think Fulham are safe. 34 for Fulham. I think they're safe. So, so it's coming from those teams now. Palace are doing their best best attempts to shoot themselves in the foot, but I think they've got enough good players. And Glasno is a really good manager. If they can keep him there till the end of the season, I think they'll be all right. I didn't realize how quite close you were to us. [laughter] Uh Jon O says, \"Would you take Deserby back?\" No, absolutely not. I can stand him towards the end. He's he honestly he he's if if Spurs go for him, I think he would be a terrible signing for you. Like gen >> I don't think we will because he's gonna want a long-term contract and and I don't think we want to give it. I think we are I genuinely think we will see Potchback after the World Cup. >> He's just he's just too he's too emotional. He's he's a bloody maniac that blow. >> Well, he was a maniac that game uh the PSG Marseilles game. He was like a maniac on the bench that so emotional. What are you doing? You can't be that emotional. you're the manager. >> He was like he was like that for us. Like it's it's quite endearing at the start because it's oh look how much he cares and the passion and all that and then by the end of it you're just like just sit down like you're not helping anything. [laughter] You're just you're just going too mad. It's >> I'm wondering whether I should volunteer for the job. >> Yeah. >> At Spurs. >> I think we're I think motivate them. >> I think we're too close to it. I think Seth Herzler, let's put you in charge of Brian. Put me in charge of Spurs. >> Would you save me? >> You know what we should do? We should do a Football Manager season like an online one where >> we try and save our clubs. >> If we try and save our clubs. Yeah, [laughter] >> we can't. Honestly, as we can't have FPL seasons that look like this and then have one of our clubs go down. >> No, I know. No, I completely agree. >> There'll be no recovering from it. >> No, there's not. >> I have to quit. I'll have to quit my whole life. >> If Burnley go on a mad one as well, we could both end up going down. You know, when Lee always wants to move abroad, I think if Spurs go down and I finish in the millions, we I'll have to actually accept that he's right and we'll have to just move abroad. >> Yeah. Yeah. I I I completely I completely get that. Um God, we're nearly out of time. We haven't covered anything this episode. [laughter] >> We have We've covered loads of stuff. It's just not been relevant. >> Yeah, that's true. N says Harland news. He obviously came off at Halime, didn't he? Um he had a bit of a niggle or something, I Pep said, >> \"Well, if he's out then, but don't it's a perfect opportunity to one, they were smashing it. Doesn't need to be there. >> Two, perfect opportunity to not play him at the weekend in the FA Cup if he needed an excuse not to.\" So, it's a two week rest for him >> nearly. Um, and if he's out, he's an easy cell, >> but he won't be. >> No, it'll be fine. nine days it'll be it'll be absolutely fine. Uh final question is from Florent. Pick three of them of them. Uh Wilson Rayan Verts Dango Rogers Anderson or Doosbury Hall till gamew week 31. >> Oh Debury Hall's coming back into the into favor. Right. Hang on. Let me >> he he I think him and Anderson feel like the imposters there because I think the other options >> Everton. So the fixture ticker 27 through31 has West Ham Bottom weirdly. Um and then above them it's Everton. >> Yeah. >> So that would rule out Juby Hall for me. Uh Ray Bournemouth at top. So Ray I think Rayan Vertz definitely. In fact looking at them again it's just Rayan Verts Dango isn't it? >> What you think I'll go Rogers still? I think I know Rogers Rogers. >> So crap. >> Yeah, Rogers Vayver. He has I mean he >> ass man. What was his XG? Hang on. Right, let's have a look. What was his XG? >> He scored got 10 points last week and eight points. >> But that doesn't make him any good. >> I think you're being harsh. >> I tell you what, owning him has been horrendous. >> It's really interesting you say it though because not owning him is also horrendous. I just feel like he's going to deliver every every week. >> I hate owning him. Every time I look at my team, he's the player I want to sell. Leads at home. Wolves away. Oh, the next two are great. To be fair, I do need him to smash leads cuz they could get back into it again. They're another team. I don't mind if they get relegated. >> Um, sorry to any Leads fans listening. Right. Uh, let let's just have a look. His XG. What was it in this game? Uh, Opter XG. Where is he? Rogers. 0.2. Brilliant. What a pointless waste of space. [laughter] Um like genuinely. In fact, although to be fair, that was the >> He hates he hates expecting metrics. He said it, didn't he in that interview? He said it's him. >> Well, I like expected metrics. And all right, let's not be so unkind. Let's go over the last six weeks and see what Rogers has been looking at. Let's just have a look at attempts on goal then. We won't look at the expected. If Morgan hates them, we'll be nice to him. >> Can't believe you've turned on Rogers. Have you got you 10 points? Can you dream of a player getting me 10 points? [laughter] >> Oh, I do love you. Um, honestly, he's been so infuriating to own because he takes up a a midfielder slot and every week I look at him and I think, I hate you, but I I love your fixture and I can't sell you because you got a great fixture. And then he blanks again and I'm there going and I have to watch him have shot after shot after shot, create chance after chance after chance and they don't finish them. And then last night I thought well at least genuinely my thought process during last night's game was well at least will be happy because it was a nil nil draw and I was thinking well you get a point you're probably all right with a point and then blooming Tyrone Ming pops up with a goal right at the end. You know, we we we've spoken a lot about Brighton and Spurs on this podcast, but I am so frustrated with how Herzel is managing that team because why would you make three transfers three transfers kind of memo [laughter] three substitutions late again when that has been we've been conceding all these late goals. We're playing well. We've stabilized the game. You take off arguably our three like biggest work rate players in wellbe Gomez and Mtoma and you bring on two teenagers and Ma who has been awful for months and then we lose the game again and it's like this is like this is just basic stuff like he overco complicates things so we have too many managers over complicate and as long as he keeps doing that for FPL reasons target us >> because we are going to keep conceding goals stupid goals cuz he tinkers around too much. Drives me mad. Okay, so here's my frustration with Morgan Rogers. Over the last six matches, he is top for goal threat amongst midfielders with 20 attempts on goal. Yet he is 18th amongst midfielders for points earned. >> 18 because in that time he's he's earned 27 points. 10 of them came in one game. 10 of them. [laughter] So that means over the last So in five games he got 17 points and one of them was an assist. >> Honestly, I can't >> I just wouldn't worry about him. I I I just I if I had him I would just keep him and just ride the highs and just he's going to he's going to be he's going to be absolutely over the next six weeks he's going to be absolutely fine. He's going to get a couple of goals. >> As man I don't know if I can cope. He's also created 12 chances. Three of them have been big chances. I just I'm infuriated by him to be honest. I'm just infuriated. But he is one of those players where you look at the fixture ticker and you go, \"Well, he's not a priority sale, is he?\" Because between now and gameweek 31, he's second on the fixture ticker. And really, in fact, let's get rid of that game. Uh because we don't need this week. So, Leeds Wolves, Chelsea, Man United, West Ham, Forest. Oh, we keep rolling it. Sunderland, Fulham, Spurs. Keep that up there. Like this is not like >> it's interesting. The chat is very divided, you know? Got JC Rogers can hall every time. China Rogers overpriced, man. Rogers every week when you don't own him. Absolutely. >> It's the same the other way around, by the way. It's not any better when you do own him. >> Yeah. Uh, okay. So, you're saying, [laughter] >> so top of the fixture ticket between 27 and 37. So you're saying Rayanne verts and Dango from these three. Yes. >> Okay. You go Dango. That's really interesting. I would definitely >> I I am so I think I'm so bitter about the Rogers now. I just feel like I'm in that mode last week. >> I know as but honestly it it was that it was that Sunday game. Do you remember there was a Sunday game? Cuz I remember I was sat in here. I had it on. It was the 4:30 game. I can't even remember who or I can't remember which game it was, but it was definitely a Sunday afternoon cuz I was sat here making graphics for the FPL family live stream. And he I honestly have never seen points dodgy like it. And I got to the end of the game and he's got nothing. And I was absolutely fuming [snorts] like beyond beyond just a little bit upset. Absolutely fuming. And I remember going back into the living room and just ranting at Lee and Lee being like, \"She's lost the plot.\" And [laughter] and I had I'd fully lost it with him. It was one of those moments where I was like, \"I fully lost it with Morgan Rogers because I just it's it's a I get why he must be difficult to not own because he's so involved and he creates chances and he has shots and but he just he has all of this potential and then he doesn't return on it.\" And then you watch him and the eye test is passed and he still doesn't return on it. And it's like, so the 10 points last week didn't really make up for my frustrations over the last few weeks. That's all I'm saying. [laughter] >> Fuming, says JC. >> Fuming. Absolutely fuming. >> Absolutely fuming. Um, amazing. Right, I think that's it. Ross, today we've not covered anything, but there'll be another one of these at least before the next uh deadline. Good luck to everyone tonight. Uh, especially those with Gabrielle triple captain because we need some points. I mean, think of me. I mean, when when Thiago scores and he's on my bench and I lose my triple captain defensive points. Just think of me. Don't think of Sam. She's got enough points this week. [screaming] [laughter] >> It's going to be all right. A, next time we're here together, we will both be on big green arrows. I'll be inside the top two million and you'll be closer to >> God. Is it that >> 2 million and three? >> Oh, I don't The thing is it I'm going to say this and it's going to but I don't think it can get worse from here like this week. >> No, this week is fine. Three players and my triple captain. Surely I at least worst case at least I pull back some of the damage. >> You're fine. This is going to be a good week. We can't fix Brighton and Spurs. I'll I'll go and apply for the Spurs job now. I'll put your name in the hat as well. We could offer to do it together. Imagine us doing it on the bench together. >> Perfect. So, >> we could definitely save them because our management skills are clearly excellent. >> Oh god. [laughter] Right. Yeah. On that note, we'll end it there. Definitely until we get any more stick in the in the chat. Uh thanks everyone for watching. Make sure you're liked. Uh make sure you're liked. Doesn't even make sense. >> I'm not sure that we are. >> Make sure you're subscribed. Make sure we're liked as in this video. Uh, check out Scouts. Um, and yeah, Sav, I will see you next week. >> Bye everyone. Green.",

    "transcript": "Hello and welcome to another video and podcast from Fantasy Football Scout. My name is Joe and today I'll be looking at the best transfer targets for gameweek 27. I'm recording this on Wednesday. Um so there's a risk some players that I mentioned may be injured or suspended by the time you see this. So bear that in mind. And obviously this is being um recorded before Wednesday game night's game. So you should be watching this from Thursday morning as well. So um also some of the underlying stats and returns hopefully will be better. So some of these picks will be u have done well in gaming 26 as well. But as I said this is for gaming 27. We're looking ahead. It's a really long gaming 26 at the moment. Um but obviously we want to be looking ahead to gamweek 27 um because that's the the week we can make changes for. Uh just reminder do press that like button does help us out. Also do remember to subscribe wherever you receive your podcast and also uh to our YouTube channel to get access to our latest videos. Um also do uh check out latest membership offers at fantasyfootscout.co.uk to get access to all the latest tools and gadgets to help you climb up your mini leagues as well. All the stats um that we mention here uh are actually from the members area there as well. So um do check that out. Um okay, let's have a look at the fixtures. Okay, gameweek 27. Um, it's a really strong week for Chelsea. They've got the plum fixture. Burnley at home. Doesn't get better than that. Crystal Palace, another great fixture. Wolves at home. Doesn't get better than that. Well, apart from Chelsea against Burnley, great fixtures. Bournemouth have good fixtures as well away to West Ham. Now, West Ham did well in game 26, beating Manchester United, but Bournemouth are scoring and scoring and scoring. They can't stop scoring at the moment. Um, so I think they should do well in this one. Sunderland against Fulham. That looks good. Um, uh, Fulham aren't in great form at the moment. Sunderland at home are good. Aston Villa, meanwhile, they have another home game. It's against Leads. Leads are really good at home. Less good away from home though. Um, Liverpool of Nottingham Forest. Remains to be seen whether any of those will make um, any of their assets or make my team quite expensive. If you want to go for Eatique or Salah even. Um, Manchester United have Everton. That could be okay. Um and then but further down as well we've got um Brenford against Brighton. That could be because Bright My team Brighton are in terrible form at the moment. Um or at least they were going into um uh Wednesday uh game week 26. Haven't played yet. Um Arsenal against Tottenham could be good uh as well. North London derby. Arsenal obviously informed. Tottenham not in form as well. Um okay. So some intriguing ties there. It looks it looks to be quite a highscoring week I think. [snorts] Um, so what I'll do is before I put up the team that I've got for game 27, which is as as if I had a free hit. So it's the free hit team as it were. Um, so before we look at that, just that's I've I've constructed that via the FPL planner tool on the Fantasy Football Scout app. Um, I've tried to keep it to my budget, which is at the moment is 102.7 million. Um, I'm looking for well over a 90% rating and expected points getting towards 60. This team, this is what I think is going to be really high scoring gameweek. This team has 62. Wow. And and a rating of 99%. I cannot get 100%. So that's that's absolute top whack. 62 I think is the best I've got in this series so far. I might have had a 63 maybe, but 62 um is a really good straw there. So uh on with the picks. Okay. >> [snorts] >> So, what I'm going to do is um just before before I read them out um just want to say I've gone for a 352. Arguably, it's such a good week for 442. It's a good week for 343 as well, especially by moving around some Chelsea players there, but more of that in a moment as well. Um so, what I'll do is I'm going to read them out and then I'm going to dive back into them and uh and explain a bit about why why I've gone for those picks there as well. So, in goal I've got Sanchez at home to Burnley. Um, Munos are home to Wolves. Um, I've got Mley at home to Fulham. I've got Gabrielle, he's away to Tottenham. North Under Derby though. Enzo [snorts] Fernandez, uh, and Palmer who is my captain. Both of them obviously are home to Burnley. Ro Morgan Rogers, he's at home to leads. Sar at home to Wolves. And Bruno Fernandez, so um, away to Everton. I've gone for Thiago from Brenford. He is at home to my side Brighton. Um he's in my real life team, so I hope he scores, but obviously it was a Brian fan. I hope he scores uh three in a 4-3 loss to [laughter] Brenford. Um Harland's is at home to Newcastle. Newcastle not great um on the road at the moment especially. Um Dravka um I've gone for he's just staple there. Four million plays. He's way to Chelsea. Not expecting any um returns apart from save points really. Krooppy Junior is on the bench. He's away to West Ham. I've gone for Richards from Crystal Palace, so you could double up there. Actually, you could easily double up on the Crystal Palace defense at home to Wolves. And Hill, James Hill, away from another Bournemouth player is away to West Ham as well. So, um, some pretty good picks there. Um, I do wish I had this team. I've got some of this team. I've got some of the players and some of the defenses. So, I've got Alderetti in my team for example. Mi is just outscoring him. consistently. Um I've got Richards actually in my team, but not Munoz. And obviously I've got Gabrielle like many people have as well. Mays to be seen whether he's going to be a good triple captain this week, but you will know a little bit more um if you're watching this after their first match um ahead of gameweek 27. Um that's still taking place game at 26. Okay, so let's have a look at the pitch. So we go the back first with Sanchez. Um I'll be hoping for a clean sheet against Burnley, so I put it that way. Um over the season they've got the worst expected goal rate and over their last six um they've expected to score uh just the three goals and they've been lucky to get five. So uh there we go. Um I really I've gone for him because he's a bit cheaper than Chalaba but Chalaba obviously another good pick there. Um I'm not dis discounting him. He gets Defcon as well. He's just more expensive. Um Gaba against Tottenham. So, as of Wednesday when I'm recording this, he's he he's had no goals or assists in his last six. So, he may well do on Thursday, uh, and so on in gaming 26 because he's got two matches. Um, but he's still he still had four shots so far and he's got multiple routes to points as well. He's got Defcon every four matches. Strong clean sheet potential. Obviously, Tottenham [snorts] have scored um eight over the last six gameweeks at the time recording, but Arsenal defense is the best this season. see um this week's video ahead of game 26 with FPL Jam. We look at their defense in much more detail. Basically, in a nutshell, they're in a total league of their own this season in terms of real life goals conceded and expected goals conceded. No one is anywhere near them. They're just in a complete league of their own. And then there's everyone else is defenses. So, that's how good they are. Michael uh versus Fulham. So, he's he's just an absolute cut price star this season. and he's got multiple routes to points as well. Clean sheets obviously against Fulham, particularly at home. He's got assist potential with an incredible four assists in his last six matches. Um plus defcon, he's averaging every other match as well. Um so Fulham amongst the six worst attacks over the last six gameweeks so far as well. So um yeah, there certainly a strong multiple roots to points there. Munoz against Wolves, another one with multiple roots to points. strong underlying stats since coming back from injury with six chances created over just last three starts. Um clean sheet potential is strong against Wolai. There's the second worst expected um goals rate uh especially recently. So over the last six matches they've only scored twice. Um and only Burnley have a worse expected goal rate. Uh Wolves uh also have only one clean sheet in their last six. Um so that's pretty poor there. Um okay, midfielders. So, I've gone Fenzo Fernandez here and immediately I know that there will be a comment in the chat saying, \"Oh my god, why haven't you got Pedro in there?\" Um, but I think those people who make those comments haven't listened to what I'm about to say. Okay? So, listen what I'm about to say and then make your comment. Okay? So, if you have more money, you can get Pedro in. Um, so you could downgrade Enzo to a 4.5 million mid, put him on the bench, and [snorts] upgrade Krooppy to Pedro. Um, and then you'd have a really good 3432. So, if you're watching and wondering that, um, it's a money issue for me. I couldn't quite afford to do that without making sacrifices elsewhere. So, you could go without Munos and just put Richards in there, for example. But, I want Munos there. So, it's just a bit too many. And also, the computer loves Enzo Fernandez. He's actually predicted to score more points than Pedro this week. That's the rate my team computer and um, uh, they're a fantasy football stout. But um but Enzo Fernandez is still a great option. He's on pens whenever Palmer is off the pitch. Um he the manager has praised his athleticism and and stamina in playing um so often. He's got two goals and assist in his last six from a very impressive 15 chances and 12 shots. So he's not too shabby. Um but it is worth pointing out if you're massive Pedro fan um that Pedro has an in an incredible four goals and five assists in his last six. Um be Burnley meanwhile so this remember why we're picking Chelsea players this week. Burnley have the worst attack this season and over the last six matches conceded 10 times um exactly the same as the expected goals conceded rate. So they're neither lucky or unlucky. They're just conceding. Um so I've gone for Palmer as well. Well, so his link up play with Pedro is outstanding, which is another notch for saying you can easily just you can easy just if you've got a little bit more money and you're willing to make some sacrifices maybe. Enzo Fernandez out, Pedro in. So, Palmer um versus Burnley. He's my captain because he is on Pens and he is actually getting game time at the moment. [snorts] So, he's notched 15 shots in his last six game weeks from five starts. Um so even if he doesn't score or assist um uh he has penalties um from the arch winner of penalties Pedro and I know that as a Brighton fan from his time there. Um so Palmer's got five goals and assists. So he's my captain this week. Uh if I was free hitting this week he's not in my real life team so he won't be my captain my real life team but if he if I had this team he would be my captain. Um uh Bruno Fernandez is next. Um he's against Everton. Uh I don't think he can be dropped at the moment even though he blanked last time out. So over his last six he has a really good really good return rate. So it's five assists and a goal. So that's as many returns in in his last six. He's got 27 chances and 12 shots. So that's the most attacking potential of any player in my 11. And arguably he could also be the captain. And in fact he could be my real life captain. It would be between him and Harland in my team I think. Um Everton meanwhile have just one clean sheet in the last six and have been unl been lucky to concede just six with an expected goals conceded rate over that time of over eight. Uh okay so they've been a bit bit lucky there just to concede six. Um we go for Rogers um against leads at home. Another player with strong underlying stats. He's got 16 shots created 10 chance in his last six um and a goal and an assist to show for it. Um still great value at 7.6. Leadeds meanwhile have conceded 12 times in the last six and only had one clean sheet over that period. In fact, away from home, they've kept just one clean sheet at all this season. So, um yeah, I strong returns there and he is the talisman for Aston Villa. Um and there's doubts over whether Watkins or Tammy Abraham will start. Don't know which. I know Rogers will though. Well, 99.9% certainly will. And final midfielders really good midfielders this week. This is why I have gone for 352, but as I said, you can go for 343. Get Pedro. Got S. Crystal Palace is Sar from Wolves. Two goals in his last three starts. Brilliant. I think he's merged as the key attacker for Palace. Always perhaps was anyway. Um, and he should be on Pens two. At the time of recording, at least he at least took the last one. That may have changed by the time you watch this, but as far as I know, at the moment he is on Pens. Um, [clears throat] up front we've got Harland against Newcastle. So even though he hasn't been up to his usual standards, he still has four attacking returns over his last four starts and has racked up 15 shots. He may have even more by the time you see this in his face Fulham in gameweek 26. I think Manchester City's um win rate against Fulham is absolutely amazing. I think it's something like 22 wins out 29. Um and I think the rest of the draws I think there's maybe two victories over I mean this is like going back a long time. Um, so over the last six game weeks, Newcastle have conceded 13 times. So, it's Newcastle I'm focused on here, gave me 27. Newcastle conceded 13 times with just one clean sheet over the last six uh game weeks there. Um, and completing the 11 is Thiago against Brighton. Brighton aren't in great shape at the moment with no clean sheets in the last six at the time of recording. Um, Thiago at home looks a man to exploit their poor recent form. He scored against them already this season. It could have an even greater hall as well. Um if you watch that match back um over his last five starts at the time recording he has registered three goals from 11 shots uh and doing exactly what he should be doing is reliable striker against the team not in form. Um uh subs really good subs here so you might be needed sometimes they are in this this team that I do each week. Um Ky Jr. he's a regular here. So eight goals is really impressive for a 4.7 million striker. He may be needed as well if there's rotational injury. Also, he's rested last time out, so I think he'll start this one. It's a really good fixture away to West Ham, even though they did well against Manchester United this time out. Richards against Wolves, why not double up on the Crystal Palace defense. So, if you didn't fancy Gabrielle, for example, I mean, why would you leave him out? But, or Maley, you could just double up. Um, you get Richards here. Um, so he's another great sub. He's averaging a defcon every four starts over his last six. Um, so that's that's reasonably good. Um occasional occasional attacking threat often in the cups though but um we might we might see that uh this time out. Um and then finally we got Hill James Hill from Bournemouth against West Ham. Uh even though Bournemouth conceded he has many routes to point. So I didn't get I could have got him in this week and I didn't. I g I've gone for Richard. So, it remains to be seen whether that move will work out, but I didn't because I just thought Bournemouth would concede and indeed they did. They gave me 26, but he still ends up with a hall because he's got multiple routes to point. So, he can get bonus defcon and assist potential. So, um over his last six starts, he's got three assists. He's only three point. No, what's he now? I think he's just gone up. So, he's 4 million now. Um three assists and he's getting Defcon every match. Not even every other match. Every match is Defcon point average. when I did the table the members area was his defcon point average was two points a match over his last six. So he's averaging defcons every match. Um and he's even fired off two shots so he could even get a goal there. Um this is this is a strong week. Um this is going to be a bad week to have a bad week if you see what I mean. Um so I really hope I can keep up with some of these players I don't have. Um and they don't punish me a bit too too much. Um, and hopefully the players I do have within this lineup like Bruno Fernandez and Harland and Chargo Rogers uh do well. Um, do check out other videos we've got. Um, ahead of gaming 27. Uh, we've got the watch list. Uh, we'll have the scout cast. We'll have I'll be uh checking in with the Fil General and Tom Freeman again for their team reveals next week. Uh, we'll have um, uh, the uh, team news developments as well. I'll be checking in with Neil towards the end of uh, next week as well. Um, so we've got loads and loads of coverage. Keep you posted for gaming 27, even though gaming 26 is going on and on and on because it's double game week. Um, thanks a lot for your time. Take care. See you soon.",

    "transcript": "[music] [music] Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode of the FPL watch list gameweek. 26. The big double has just started and gameweek 27 is not for a week and a half, but we're going to take a bit of a first look, a bit of an overview of what's to come up in FPL over the next couple of weeks. Steven is not with us, but it's just me and Tom and we will be back together as a team next Wednesday as we get closer to the next deadline. I promise, as someone asked in the chat, are the three talking points today all going to be Chelsea? I can't say that they won't be. Tom, how we doing? Uh, I'm all right. Yeah, it was uh another game of two halves yesterday if we're honest. Um, [snorts] shot ourselves in the foot again, but I did buy Xiao Pedro, so it was nice that he was pushed in the back again uh when he was facing away from goal for another penalty. Um, he must have been sitting there with mixed emotions, but and then Palmer. Yeah, Palmer obviously hauled again and we we told people not to buy him, but yeah, I think is he is Palmer back? What do you think? >> I mean, he looked good in that game. Leadeds gave him so much space in midfield. So, they played about five, didn't they? They played five and then two in midfield and their midfield just continued to get overrun and that sort of space behind their midfield too and um and their defense was so good. So, Palmer had a lot of space there. He does look great and we do get a lot of penalties, but if you take the penalties away, he's still not massively worth the money. So, it depends how many um how many he can get. That's that's the real question. And he's got Burnley this week and then after that it gets a lot more difficult again and then Champions League will start. So, I I just think if you haven't if you haven't bought it now, you haven't bought it. >> Yeah, that's probably fair enough. Three penalties in two weeks. Um, I think Enzo's had more non-PENXGI and failed to to do anything really. But, um, yeah. Do you want to talk us through your team so far and why you triple captain Gabrielle? >> Yeah. So, uh, I'm on 10. I'm technically on 11 from from four cuz uh, Tarosski will sub in for Dorgu. Um, the less said about my Everton duo, the probably the better. Um, one nil up and then losing 2-1. O'Brien getting sent off and Tarovski finishing the game on nine defcon which he had once O'Brien got sent off. Juicebury Hall scoring 13 on my bench last week. Nice home fixture against Bournemouth. Goes and blanks. Bruno doesn't really matter. His ownership's so high now. And then fortunately Brian and Burmo came away with a lastm minute assist and bonus point to get me six to make it slightly respectable. But um yeah, no defcon for Taroski is very annoying and I will not be playing him again uh elsewhere. So I rolled my transfer, Richards, Rya, triple cap on Gabrielle, which we'll talk about. Anderson Rice, Harland, and Ekit. I really need something from Eatique now really. Um and then of course from from Gabrielle. So yeah, I decided to triple captain him. I don't particularly like it. I was never fully set on it and I don't like it nearly as much as other people, but it's just the lack of uncertainty for the later doubles. If I knew Harland had had a double later on in the season, whoever it was against, I wouldn't have played it. Um, but I liked it more than the potential Villa double. I liked it more than potential Liverpool double. So, I just didn't want to take that that risk. So decided to play on Gabrielle despite the fact that I do think Brenford score and the fact that I've benched Thiago knowing how my bench points have gone over the past few weeks mean he probably does score. Um so we'll see how the rest of it goes and um yeah 11 from four not particularly great. >> Yeah you watch Harland score a brace this week and um outscore Gabrielle. >> Yeah >> difficult got 16 points against Fulham last time. Um, >> is his ownership below 100%. >> That's a great question. You find out >> it's not. It's 110. >> Yeah. So, yeah, that's pretty low though. I think it was about that last week actually. 115 maybe. Yeah. >> Yeah. I'm on 15 because I did Bowen to Xiao Pedro, which to be honest, based on my history with Bowen, I was expecting to blow up after I bought him in for Thiago all those weeks ago, but Pedro did the business. Possibly could have had more as well, but I think he had seven shots. The first time he's ever had seven shots in a game. Um, but yeah, then Bruno was disappointing. Pretty quiet game from him. Sanchez just again like I feel like at some stage we're going to deserve a clean sheet, but to be honest, when you defend like that, we don't you don't deserve a clean sheet. The one against Wolves was more frustrating. And Sanchez like went absolutely mental on his defense when we conceded that corner. Um so yeah, we I need something against Burnley. Um otherwise it it's not great. Um and then Enzo was fairly quiet, but still post he somehow post good numbers. Like maybe it's just an accumulation of lots of smaller chances, but he got 0.81 xGI. >> Is that mainly XA? >> Uh yeah, 65. Did he make a big chance? >> Uh yeah, he did for J Pedro in the first half. >> Yeah. >> I don't I don't know if it went down as a big chance, but he chipped over the top for J Pedro, who missed it. I'd be surprised if it went down as a big chance, but that's probably where a lot of it comes from. This is the thing with Enzo and this is the reason that I didn't buy him and I've been pretty confident that he is the one that I'd be happy to go against and if I bought if I the one I wanted was J Pedro and I was never going to find a way to him is that Enzo does frustrate like this. We've all been there at times with Enzo in games like these that we buy him, the fixtures look good, the minutes look good, the data is good, but he can just go games where he's not close enough to the box. Now late on again it was we needed a winner. He was starting to push onto that edge of the box area like he did against West Ham. And if it fell to him and it and he scores it, it looks very different. But he does go games where when Palmer's particularly in the team, he doesn't look as good from an FPL point of view. >> Yeah, he Yeah, I mean against Wolves, he had over one XGI. Um >> he he tried that Rabona when he was one-on-one with the keeper. I don't know if you saw the highlights of that, but yeah, he could have just shot. Yeah, he could have just played normally and scored, but >> anyway. Yeah, so 15 from four. I also triple captained kind of same same thought process. I just thought with Man City having to beat Arsenal or Bayern and get through in the FA Cup, I just thought it's too many variables and by 36 I guess they could be focusing on other things. If Arsenal beat them at the Etihad in gameweek 34, I think or maybe 343. >> 33. Yeah. >> Oh, that's in the double, is it? >> That's the double game. >> That's also why triple captain in 33 is not actually that great because you'll be triple captaining Harland against I think it'll be like Palace and Arsenal which is not great. Um >> yeah, fair enough. So yeah, hopefully tomorrow night Gabrielle can um cash in some xG or Yeah. What would what would you take from tomorrow night? >> Tomorrow night? >> Uh, Thursday night? >> Sorry. >> Yeah. No, I wasn't saying like that. I just So, that's Brenford. Um, I mean, real realistically, we need two clean sheets, right? Like >> if we take two and then hope for a 15. That's quite seems a little bit unlikely. >> No, I take four. >> Yeah, you four and then hopefully four and six >> and then a clean sheet. Yeah, it gets you 10. I mean, I I triple captain Harland against Leeds and he blanked earlier in the season, so I'd take anything at this point. Um, >> it's weird because there's a different mentality because those of us who did well with it, like I got 13 from Harland >> or Yeah, 13, I think. And >> 16. You went Burnley, didn't you? >> Yeah. >> Uh, yeah. No, I went two girls. Oh, West Ham. >> Yeah, the same. I think it was the same 16. Um, so as a result, my expectations on the triple captain are higher, which I think makes me more inclined to think I didn't want to play it this week because I know that you can get 16 from someone like Harland in a single. The issue is is those single game weeks are really not very good for the rest of the season. Um the only good one Harland's got is 34 which is Burnley away which will probably might form a double and also might not but it's also the week that will probably free hit if it doesn't if it stays in 34. So then you can't play it there. Outside of that, like there's no week that you can play the triple captain on Harland and apart from Brenford at home potentially in 36. And you look at the other teams like Liverpool, there isn't really anything because you have to wait until at least game week 32 to play it because you want to know if there's going to be a later double or not. Bruno like his fixtures after 32. He's got leads at home in 32 where most of us would be wild carding. Brenford at home in 34, Forest at home in 37. That was part of uh part of it that by the time you get to 32, which is if you haven't played it now, you're probably going to save it to then because you're hoping for another double, which we won't know until 32. There's just no good single for it. >> Yeah. >> From after from after 32. Yeah. >> Yeah. Someone in the chat saying Palmer this week. I could be worse to be fair, but you may as well at this point. >> I suppose if you didn't play it on a double to now play on Palmer home to Burnley. I mean it could work. Like I'm I'm not I wouldn't be against it if that's what someone wanted to do, but >> I would always backed the double over Palmer home to Burnley. I think >> Salah has Brenford at home on the last day of the season. >> Could be his final ever game for Liverpool. >> Anyway, let's move on. That didn't get a great reaction. Um [laughter] >> I mean I mean I don't see a position I mean >> you play over to Brenford even if it was a single right. Yeah. >> Yeah. I'd play that over over Salah I think. Um like yeah you've got to be in a position to even buy Salah in in 38 in the first place. Um but yeah. >> Yeah definitely. Right. So let's obviously we got a bit of time till the next deadline. So um we can have a slightly sort of broader view. I've got the fixtures on screen. Um and then we can tie this in with the midfielder chat as well because one team that sits at the top is Bournemouth. Um and they've got Well, yeah, we do Hill first if you like. 3.9 million defender. >> Not 3.9 anymore. >> Did he go up? >> Got his first price change. >> 4 million gets another attack in return. And I mean it's the new Sessi. >> Yeah, Sessi got what was it? Two Defcons or something. and Hill got [laughter] >> all of the bonus and an assist. Yeah. >> Nine points. >> Um I mean if you need a defender to play every week between now and 31, he's got to be he's got to be top if you need a cheap one, right? >> Yeah, definitely. I mean the other teams at the top of the ticker, City, Liverpool, Villa, Arsenal. So you're not going to get a cheap defender from there. And then it goes into sort of Fulham and Palace. So Richard, >> I think Anderson. Yeah, I think Anderson's the other one that I'd have a look at. This ticker has 26 on. So, uh, Palace are lower down once you take that out because they're probably going to blank in 31 as well. Fulhammer are probably the other one if you were looking cheap. Sunland, Spurs, West Ham, Forest, Burnley's pretty good. Um, so either Anderson or or Quanka. Um, if Quanka starts again this week. Um or the other one is sorry I'm looking at is Brenford. So of course they're lower down because they play Arsenal this week but then it's Brighton, Burnley, Bournemouth, Wolves leads. Um >> but Collins look at um yeah we probably need to see the team sheet for them tonight tomorrow night. >> Yeah, if the issue with the team sheet tomorrow night is I think they'll probably play a back five. So they'll all play. So then we won't particularly know. Um I think actually what might give us a better indication is who plays in the cup at the weekend who plays next to Pinnock because I think that will imply who's going to play the following weekend against Brighton. Um but there are a few good ones but it's pretty difficult to ignore Hill at the moment. >> Yeah. one player who could potentially I don't know maybe a bit of Munoz if you're um >> obviously on the graphic he hasn't played Burnley yet but Wolves he's still got Wolves United Tottenham it's probably getting a little bit late I'd say >> if you if you miss Burnley then >> yeah it's one of those if you've missed Burnley it's it's a tough buy now I think >> yeah so I think yeah defenders if you you're looking for the next four or five got be hill um >> Mhm. M >> potentially Brenford or maybe Anderson. But I can tell you Anderson is a very frustrating player. At the weekend he went from he was on about eight points and then lost his clean sheet and finished on nine defcon. Um >> yeah and got booked. >> Did he get booked as well? >> I think he conceded twice. He conceded a point. Yeah, >> he conceded too. That's why. [laughter] >> Yeah, he had a clean sheet until about 75th minute. Um >> the other one is um is don't laugh is is Van Djk or Canate, right? >> So they've got Forest, West Ham, Wolves, Spurs, Brighton between now and the wild card is it's a pretty decent run. It's just whether you trust them. >> Yeah. I mean, we had Van Djk earlier in the season for some easier fixtures and didn't pay off, but since everyone sold him, he's he scored. got is he >> only scored I think. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> I mean they were against City but >> I sold him and although Taroski's been dreadful since I bought him and I've benched him for his only clean sheet since I bought him. >> I've not missed Van Djk really. >> Yeah. His defcons have dried up as well, haven't they? >> Yeah. So that's why like if I buy a defender this week, James Hill might be it. But if I think that Collins is going to start for Brighton at home, Burnley away, Wolves at home, and leads away, he might be the one I go to. He's the one I'd like to buy. >> Yeah, to be fair, if you need a if you're still looking for a dog replacement, I'm guessing that's for Doo, right? >> No, it's for Taroski, actually. >> Bye-bye, Taco. >> Already soon. >> So soon. I mean, if you look at the Everton fixtures for anyone who's got him, there's only one game between now and the the wild card that you really want to play him in, which is Burnley at home, and it's not even that worthwhile, I don't think. >> Yeah, that's fair enough. So, yeah, he'll probably Yeah, you can. It's a door group placement. It's a enabler. Um, >> it's not many I mean, yeah, obviously as we get closer to the wild card week, it's going to be obviously defenders probably less of priority. Um, I guess although We'll be looking to put out 11. I might end up on double Fulham. The So the way way I've planned my team is that in gameweek 29, I'll need a new defender that will play for me in 29 and 31. >> Yeah. >> And Fulham have West Ham at home, Burnley at home in those two games. So I might end up doing like Duo to Quanka or something and and having double Fulham defense, which I'm sure will end badly. But um yeah, it kind of just depends what fits your team best. But if you need one for all of them, I I would look at I would look at James Hill. >> Yeah, to be fair, I mean, if I'm keep Gabrielle and Timber, I'm going to need a D group replacement. >> So maybe it is Fulham, West Ham. Is that Forest? Burnley. >> Yeah, >> might be joining you there on the uh How much is that Robinson these days? >> No, you're not buying Robinson. You're buying Quanker at 43. >> Well, you don't think Bassie could turn up? >> He could. That's the thing. I'm going to buy Collins and Quanker and then neither of them are going to start the blank probably. >> Yeah, fair enough. Um but yeah, maybe I'll look at Hill Fulham. But yeah, um and yeah, probably too late for Munoz. Let's move into midfield with Ry. Can you say it's not? It's not Ryan, is it? It's >> Ryan, I think. >> Ryan. Yeah, >> he has taken the league by storm. Um >> three game weeks, two starts, returned in all three appearances. um scored last night, scored against Villa, assist against Wolves. >> Decent data, 0.55 per 90. Um yeah, I mean he's only 5 a half million. Pretty strong fixtures. >> Yeah, fixtures are great. Again, just like Hill, if you need to play a player between now and the blank, they're probably top. So, he should absolutely be on radar. He's been eased in a little bit. played his first 90 last night, scored, didn't get bonus because he got booked. Um, >> which I think is interesting, but I think he did get bonus the game before where he didn't get booked and scored and got taken off early. So, it's not like a he'll never get bonus. It's uh probably a case by case and the fixtures are good. Um yeah, there's going to be a lot of competition now in those cheap midfield spots cuz you've got um Ryan, you're going to have Harry Wilson back after the City game tonight. The fixtures for Fulham get pretty good again, maybe after Sunderland. And then the other one is going to be Dangitara for the Brenford fixtures. So there's going to be a lot of competition in these cheap mid spots. And yeah, you just got to pick if you have one, you've got to pick where you go. I mean, I've got Anderson and Jesus Hall. >> I was going to ask, you know what I'm going to say? Do you buy Ryan or Anderson? >> I'd buy Ryan, I think, >> because those fixtures are good enough that you just play him every week and he's looked good enough. I would take that gamble over a short term. The issue with buying Anderson now is the the benefit to Anderson is over a 10 15 gameweek spell he's going to score 60 points because he's going to get four every week and that's great but over a four gameweek spell suddenly 16 doesn't seem so good. >> Sorry. Did you just see me freeze? >> No, I was just I think uh Thomas Frank's been sad. That was the uh >> He has >> just flashed up. >> Yeah, he has. >> North London derby um new manager bounce then. >> I know. Um not particularly surprising after the result last night, I don't think. >> Yeah. Five points above relegation zone. Wow. >> Yeah. Um so yes, I would buy someone like a Rayan. Um I'd buy Dangotara. I'd buy all of those over Anderson now because over a short period you'd back the attack, you'd back the explosive and just like on a free hit like you'd never pick Anderson on a free hit, would you? Because you'd try and pick someone who's got a higher ceiling. um and over a short term run of games like people saying in um Enzo in the chat like after Burnley you're going to have uh Rayanne you're gonna have Harry Wilson like people have penciled in uh Enzo to Harry Wilson but you've got Rayan and Dangara >> to um to compete in that spot as well now. >> Yeah. Um I could go back to the fixtures, have a look at Brenford cuz they um from an attacking point of view, they've got some pretty tempting ones. I think Shard's someone I'm going to consider when he's back from suspension. >> It's just that um >> Dango's 5.8. >> Yeah, Shard's data is >> he was before he got he was the top he was top for XGI, but yeah, he is, as you say, he's more expensive. Um, >> yeah. So, there's lots of those good cheap mids. I do like Ryan and I know both of us are are big listeners to Planet FPL and he's been banging on about him as soon as he joined that he's going to be a good pick >> and he's looked great. So, I've got no issue with it. Just the chances are you're only going to own one of those cheap mids and you've got to pick which one it's going to be. >> Yeah. So, Wilson, Dango, Rayanne. >> I I still think Rayanne would be last. >> Yeah, I think with the Harry Wilson's such a streaky player, though. Do you know what I mean? He >> I think I'd buy Dango. >> It's finished now, but he has got Burnley in the blank. >> It's going to be a big ship. There's going to be a big If you bet against that in the blank, you I mean, he's been hammering me for weeks, but >> Yeah, >> he's very highly owned. Um >> Yeah. Yeah. Enzo Fernandez most sold midfielder this week before burning at home. What could go wrong? >> Yarez was the most bought player this week. >> Yeah, it could. I suppose if I don't know. I mean, he was benched last week, but he did score twice. So, >> Ryan, the second most bought midfielder. >> Couple of price rises perhaps. Um, >> Rogers as well being bought. Love a little low xg Rogers Hall 0.21 last week. [snorts] [laughter] >> Outrageous. Outrageous. >> He troubled defcons again. He ended on 11. He started to start to put a shift in. Um looking at the ticker any more midfielders? Um you bought Embo last week. >> Do you think Man United are still still buy? >> Yeah, I probably wouldn't buy I'd buy Bruno now. I probably wouldn't buy in Burmo like Everton away, Palace at home, Newcastle away, Villa, Bournemouth. Like it's fine. Like I'll keep him for those games, but I think there are better mids to buy now. Vert is the other one as is Rogers if you've got more money. Like Rogers has got Brighton leads Wolves, Chelsea, United, West Ham between now and the blank. And um Vertz has got Forest, West Ham, Wolves, Spurs, Brighton. So there are a lot of options and there are going to be a lot of midfield transfers being made over the next couple of weeks I think. >> Yeah. Perhaps one to take out. What do you think of taking out Declan Rice with the fixtures to come? >> I mean I plan on doing it if I'm honest. I just think there are better options elsewhere for for the for these games. Um like Spurs away now maybe won't be quite as good. Dennis, Chelsea, Brighton away, Everton at home is pretty good, but predicting Declarry's returns are so hard. >> Yeah, >> I'd rather one of those other mids like a like a Vert, an Burmo, a Rogers probably over him now. >> And he's going to have to go before the blank anyway. >> Yeah, you're not bothered about value in um [snorts] sort of because you're probably not going to want him on wild card. I wouldn't have thought. >> Probably not. probably not because I mean they're fixtures from 35 onwards. I've had him a while but no I I I'm not going to keep him for that because he's gonna have to go in the blank anyway because I'm going to keep Harland and Gabrielle. Um and I don't really want to play a back four that week. So he's going to have to go anyway. So >> yeah, fair. I've got Yeah, I'm three up on Rice, but he'll probably drop I guess if he keeps blanking. And Timber's the one though I'm I'm haven't made any money on Timber, so probably have to look to sell him. >> I have to buy two three defenders. Well, >> my defense is not looking great for 31. I got two Arsenal, Chris Richards, and Doru. >> So, I've got Gabrielle, Doru, and Richards. And I'm planning on selling Taroski, who's one of the only two defenders who actually has a fixture that week. >> Yeah, I really should be looking at defenders, actually. um went to buy Hill probably um >> and I know we're going off topic but the difference I suppose when you look at my team is I've got Harland Ekit Thiago so I don't need a forward transfer. >> Yeah I >> like those two just just just carry it through until until wild card now. So, as much as I don't think defender transfers are that great, my team's set up in a way that apart from maybe selling Rice and one of my midfielders, I don't actually need that many attacking transfers, which is why my team has not looked great for the past couple of weeks because it's looked better for the long term. Um, just got to hope Brian and Burmo >> continues to get returns. Trust the process. >> Yeah. Yeah. I I think I'll be doing J Pedro to Thiago before we play Arsenal. Um, cool. We'll move on to Fors, but before we do that, I've got a quick uh sponsored message from British Army Recruitment, who have once again back with us. So, thank you for their support um over the next few weeks. So, this episode is brought to you by British Army Recruitment. You might be wondering how exciting You might know how exciting uh and challenging an army career would be, but you may also be wondering what's in it for you. Um you may not know this, but sport is built into your day-to-day army life. You don't have to squeeze football into your evenings because most bases reserve Wednesday afternoons just for sport. So you can play rugby, football, cricket, or any uh basically any other sport you can think of. Um, and obviously we all love football on this podcast and the Army is FA affiliated. So, it has its own teams competing across the country and they'll fund your qualifications if you wish to become a coach or referee. Um, so you're not just playing, you're also developing key life skills. Um, some soldiers go on to compete at semi-professional level and play in the UK's biggest sporting venues like Wimbledon and Twickenham. Uh, so the pathway is there if if that's something you want to pursue. Um, and then all that aside, the Army is also the UK's biggest apprenticeship provider and the number one apprenticeship employer is listed by the Sunday Times. So, you can also gain civilian qualifications up to degree level. Um, so if that sounds like your kind of team, search Army Jobs to find out more. That's Army Jobs. Uh, thank you for their support. >> So, yeah, moving on to forwards. Pedro is the one we've highlighted. He is banging form. No players got more points in five the last five game weeks. Um >> it's hurting not owning I mean >> cross references XG but I'm sure you can moan about that [laughter] >> to the Chelsea you everyone go I go to the Chelsea games every week for the past few weeks with no Chelsea in my team basically hoping we win because of like Kaisedo and um like Netto and Estal scoring basically every week. Um, but yeah, Jal Pedro has looked absolutely on it. Since we're seniors come in, he has been our best attacker. He is the one, if I could own one Chelsea player, it would be J Pedro. It doesn't fit my team, so I'm not going to own one for Burnley at home, and that I've already accepted that, but he is the one I'd want, and I'd want him above Palmer. Palmer on pens is great. He's very expensive. Um, but yeah, Ja Pedro is the one the one that I would like to have. Took his goal really well. Burnley at home is great. Um, it's just the fact that like it's one game now. Like are we really buying Chelsea for one game? Like if you don't own any. So like I'm looking for a rise replacement. I'm not going to go Enzo for one game before I have to sell him again. Am I? >> No. It would be if you had four or five transfers then you could like maybe work something. But >> yeah. Is Palmer threatening yet with his ownership or >> uh I don't I didn't fe I actually looked at my rank this morning and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. >> Jedro was 50%, Palmer's 12. So no, Palmer's didn't actually hurt. Jedro hurt. Um but and Enzo 50% blank also was all right. >> Yeah. Um but yeah, Jedro Yeah. four goals in five. He does seem to be enjoying himself under Rena. They do seem to have struck up a nice connection and I'm not convinced his minutes are under any sort of threat from Liam Dilap >> especially now this midweek's out the way. Um >> we've got a pretty decent schedule for the next few weeks. Burnley at home they're like captaincy contenders but it's difficult that if you don't like so if I said you had let's say you had Bowen right a transfer you did last week and you didn't own your only two strikers were Harland Bowen and then Maru who are you selling Bowen for this week if I had three or more transfers I'd probably go Jah Pedro for a week but [snorts] if I had two or one transfers I would just Leave it. Have Bournemouth at home and then go Thiago. Probably keep Bow for one more week. >> Fine. Maybe Bow wasn't a good example, but if you had a forward you had to sell. >> Who does Thiago have? Um >> Brighton at home. >> Yeah, I'd go to Thiago, I think. >> Yeah, that's the thing. >> Unless you think he's better longterm. I mean, after Arsenal, he does have Villa, Newcastle, Everton. >> Yeah, but I mean I'd rather Thago. He's got >> Yeah, >> after that he's got Burnley, Bournemouth, Wolves, Leads. >> Yeah, it wouldn't shock you. Um like Jal Pedro's is why I'm kind of slightly loaded to captain. He is the kind of player who can kind of just drift out of a game. Like if we beat Burnley 3-0 and Enzo scored with Palmer twice, it wouldn't shock you at all. So >> I do think that is the case with Chelsea a little bit that you don't like when the when you get the goal notification, you don't know who it's going to be. >> Yeah. Yeah, that's fair. Um >> um it could be any of them which does make capy a bit difficult which is I mean I don't have them so my captain is going to be on Harland but um >> especially because Newcastle have got a they've got a Champions League. >> Is that away before City? >> I think it is away second leg I think. >> Yeah, that's I think that's quite straightforward then. >> And Bruno G looks like he's pulled his hamstring. >> Yeah, they are struggling a bit. Um, >> yeah, it's away and they play. So, they don't even have an easy cup game this weekend either. They've got Villa away. >> That's pretty. >> So, they got Villa away on Saturday evening, Quag away on Wednesday evening before City away on Saturday, followed by Quarag on the Tuesday. >> Yeah, I think it might be Harland um the best captain this >> he'll be back to being the number one especially when he scored outs scores Gabrielle this week. He'll be back to being the highest captain player next week. >> Yeah. So, I think Pedro is probably um Have you missed the boat? It's fair to say potentially. I mean, you're just coming out of good fixtures and he's got points and then he goes into hard fixtures. So, probably >> I think you missed the boat. I think if you haven't got Thiago, I'd buy Thiago before Jedjo now cuz I don't think it's even worth the extra transfer. >> Yeah, if you had five, I might do it. But yeah, Brighton at home is not not bad to be fair for um no Thiago. >> Can't wait to own Thiago again. Watching him hoping he blanks every week is horrible. I mean at the weekend he should have had a penalty for that pull back and then he got a penalty that was a little bit less contra more controversial but never doubt him from the spot. >> Um >> who is um so a couple of things on on forwards. So I suppose I've got Ekk how he didn't score again against City. >> Can you describe that big chance because I left the room and I s I came back and Jamie Carrager was saying Ekit's got to score. >> So it was a it so he laid it off to they were running the defense was there he passed out to Salah on the left wing. Then Salah sort of cut back chopped back and crossed it in whilst Ech ran behind the defense where the defense didn't drop. So he had a free [clears throat] header attacking the ball just in front just towards the goal of the penalty spot and just put it wide and like Donnaruma was absolutely rooted to the spot. Like if he'd put it on target it probably would have scored. Um >> yeah he yeah he's a big chance magnet though to be fair. He's um happy to own him. Um >> he's going absolutely nowhere. Forest away West Ham Wolves Spurs Brighton. I'm keeping him for that run 100%. Is he a buy? >> Yeah. Would you rather echk or vert because the majority of people can't get to both. >> I just think it depends what fits your team better. >> Yeah. I mean Declan Rice is like you're doing is probably the most I mean Enzo and Declan Rice I guess are the two pressing transfers out. But if you have Jia Pedro you could um you could [snorts] get but you could do like Enzo and J Pedro or something if you could work some money. >> Yeah. I I I I like Ekato. He's an absolute big chance magnet and he I actually think the game tonight is his biggest risk of not starting. >> Dude, do they have >> Are they out the No, >> no, they've got Brighton. >> I I think it's too important. I don't really see Sunderland away seriously tough game. >> Yeah, I think he plays all of them. >> Yeah. The only concern is once the Champions League starts either side of Spurs at home, >> but like they're so bad when he doesn't play >> and they're also in a in a serious top four race that they have to win. So >> yeah, >> no, we're back down to >> someone asking why I plan on getting rid of Rise. >> Just think they were better mids. Now, we've all bought Rice because he's >> Yeah, we've all bought Rice because um >> he's got the double, but after the double, he's going to have to go because of the blank anyway. It's just when you It's just when you do it. >> Yeah. Rice in his last five, his last six games. So, that's includes his brace. After the brace, he's gone 33135. >> Yeah. So yeah, I think he's pretty safe to take on. I mean, he he'll tick over and he's not a bad pick, but um I'm saying like Tony Crows. I'll take that. Um [laughter] >> just looking at the odds for the next Spurs manager. >> Let me guess who is. Ryan Mason is unemployed, I believe. He must be up there. >> He's not up there. Do they have any coaches who can Didn't they bring in a coach recently that people were saying could be interim? >> Who's Zerby his favorite? >> Yeah, he left his job yesterday. Yeah. >> Yeah, he did. >> It's risky though coming in with a completely new style of play. Five points ahead of relegation. >> Poch is second. >> Glasnner is third. [laughter] Yeah, Glasin's press conference this week. He will hit the exit button. [laughter] >> Yeah, if they lose to Burnley, the eject button. [snorts] >> Yeah, >> that that seems >> I think these are like I I use a there's just a website called like odds checker that just gives you all of them and like virtually no one's running it at the moment either. So, um no one really knows basically. But, uh yeah, any predictions on who you think is going to be the next Spurs manager? Let us know in the chat. An back. [laughter] An back. Could you imagine? Is an unemployed? >> Yeah. Yeah. So is Amarin. >> Yeah. Amarin [snorts] is 25 to1. >> He's got to be an interim and then Poch after the World Cup. Surely >> Poch is not going to leave a home World Cup three months before it. >> No. Right. Should we look at our teams? Yeah. Um, I am first up. Game 27. Bus team reads as Sanchez, Timber, Gabrielle Richards, Enzo Rice, Bruno Fernandez, Morgan Rogers, Erling Harland, Jao Pedro, Hugo Eatik with Yoke Anderson as my sub. >> God, look at that. You even get to bench Anderson. >> Yeah, this it's it's been planned well. This four gamewe streak has has been planned well. hasn't quite got the results yet, but um cuz Richards Yeah, I need Richards to do something. Um but yeah, I probably the captaincy will go to Harland. Ja Pedro will be vice and tempting, but yeah, I like we said it's Chelsea can share them around and Pedro he can sort of do you think a comparison to Firmino is unfair in the sense that like he'll always play well but he might not always get the goals or do you think he's better than that? I think he's more of a goal. I think he's more selfish than than Firmino was. >> Fair. Yeah. I don't know. I just I'm not convinced. I think if if Harland had maybe like I don't know Everton away or something could be a conversation, but Newcastle going to Carabag which I think is in Azabaijan >> which [snorts] is very far away. So that >> it's a it's a tough week for for for Newcastle especially if Bruno Gimme is out as well. Yeah, for sure. So, I think that would be an easy captaincy decision. I've got two I've got two threes, so the only position I guess would be Rice. Um, >> yeah, >> but I'm just checking. Vert is more expensive, isn't he? I wouldn't be able to get to Vertz with.1 million. >> Uh, how much have you got? No, you wouldn't. >> Yeah, he must be like eight something. Yeah. So, I would have >> 7.7. No, I'd have 7.4 to spend on Declan Rice replacement. So, um, and I could I guess I could do Duo to Hill, but I'm not probably do that a week when I actually want to play him just in case he gets injured. So, >> I'm sorry. Um, sorry, I'm completely off topic. I'm looking at the Newcastle team last night because I haven't se I haven't actually seen >> Tali didn't Yeah. >> So, there's no Tanali. Tanali was on the bench. Bruno G is now injured. Lewis Miley was also not in the squad and Joe Linton is also injured. Yeah, they said uh Miley had a setback. They reported that yesterday. >> Yeah, >> he benched Vissa and Voltoada. >> Yeah, I mean they won so >> fair play. But uh that midfield going up against cities is uh >> Yeah. >> And you bench Lewis Hall fair. >> Um >> um you're just going to roll. Yeah, you could. Rice, you'd have to use two transfers on uh >> if I wanted verse. I mean, yeah, I guess it could go like right. I'd have to work it out to be honest. I need to I need to come up with a proper I need to sort out my defense essentially for the next for 31, but just sell Sanchez. >> I can't I can't sell a player who's got a fixture 31 >> Sanchez to Keller. So, you're going to keep Sanchez every week until the double till the blank? >> Yeah. I mean, I don't I'm not sure that's high priority. If I have a spare transfer, I might work it. But um Arsenal villa, Newcastle, Everton, we'll probably fluke one clean sheet in there. >> Here's a question. When he goes when we go to Arsenal, would you play Dravka against >> Probably Dravka? I don't even care who >> against Brenford. >> Yeah, probably Dravka. >> Yeah, but I've just bought Thiago, which be annoying, but yeah. >> Yeah, that's true. >> Yeah. So, I need to go away and look at a defensive plan for 31. Um >> the team looks good though. Yeah, it's rolling a transfer is so nice when you just have two. It's should do it more. >> You should. It's nice. It's fun. >> Yeah, you you're up 6 in the bank, two threes. >> Yeah. Um I'm probably more likely to make a transfer, I think, than you are. Rya, Richards, Anderson, Gabrielle, and Burma, Anderson, Rice, Bruno, Ekit, Harland, Thiago. So, as I said, I don't have any Chelsea, but I haven't owned Chelsea for Brenford, Palace, West Ham, Wolves, leads. So, >> you got a red arrow. >> You need three. >> It's true. It's true. Um, so I'm not going to own one for Burnley. It's the final it's the final game in the in the in the run and I'm not going to buy one. So I'm quite happy with Eatique Harland Thiago and defensively it's okay like from next week Anderson has a pretty good run so Gabrielle just plays every week Richards. So I do feel like I need a defender and as much as Dorgu out is probably the sensible thing to do. Um, Tarosski to Collins frees up money for rice to Verts. I haven't decided if I definitely want Verts. It could be Rogers in that spot. Um, but those Liverpool fixtures are very appealing. So, at the moment, I'm looking at Taroski to to Collins Rice to Vverts. Um, I don't think I can do it if I do Dory to Hill. Don't think I'm I think I could have if I did the transfer last night, but I was never going to do that really, was I? Oh, no. I'm sure anyway. >> What's the deal with Collins? You need to see him. >> I mean, obviously if he's tomorrow, then that's a complete no. >> Yeah. Then I can't buy him. Um I'd need to see him start tomorrow and not play in the cup and one of the other center backs play in the cup with Pinnock. >> Is Pinnock is he the complete reserve? He hasn't been playing. No. Yeah, he's >> Yeah, he's like He'll play in the cup. >> Yeah, he hasn't played a single minute since game five. Um >> Um It is a risk. It is a risk. So, I could do I could just go somewhere else. >> You wouldn't go >> I could just go Taroski to Hill >> instead and then when I upgrade Dorgu go to someone more expensive >> further down the line. So, >> you want to play uh you don't need to play them this week, do you? No, not really. >> No, I don't. I mean, I don't particularly want to play Anderson. >> Yeah, I I never want to play Anderson. >> Like away at Sunderland. Like, not really. So, like if I did Taroski to Collins, I'd bench Anderson. >> Yeah. And then what about the other Anderson? Is he sticking around? >> I mean, this other Anderson or Jbury Hall, I'm going to keep them this week. Are you keeping Elliot Anderson through? >> Are you keeping him? >> Probably. >> I think I would play Jesus Hall at home to United. >> Would you? >> It's Yeah, but but this is the thing with there's not really much point in owning Elliot Anderson if you're going to like faf around with it. Like you need >> You just have to play him every week. >> Like 4755744 34. I guess you you're kind of just gonna irritate yourself if you get it wrong. Like that's the kind of bad thing about having two half decent eight attackers, I guess. >> Yeah. People saying Rice is a crazy cell. I just think there's more upside with those other players. >> I guess I guess there is the case to say it's Tottenham without sticking the boot in too much. But >> but like you say like he could then easily get a couple of corner assists against Chelsea, you know, like >> when we played them in, but >> Stanford Bridge, we they scored a couple of corners. >> I mean, maybe I don't need to do it this week because Vers is away at Forest, which isn't particularly straightforward. >> You can't do Tarovski to Hill and then Anderson to anyone decent, can you? >> Uh, yeah, probably. It would be >> I I'd have seven and a half. I'm 0.1 short of Rogers. [snorts] >> That's a bit night. Yeah, it's probably Yeah, you have to decide on Rice, but um got plenty of time to do it. >> But I'd rather like if I was going I'd go like Dango, I think. And I'd punt on that. I think I really like Dango. I think his I think he could be really good for these for these games. >> Yeah. a second Brenford attacker will um like you've got with Embomo and Fernandez is because the ownership is so high on Thiago and Bruno. It's um it's it's good to have. >> Um shall we do the super chats? >> Yes, >> before we finish. And you're obviously going to Captain Harland. >> Yeah, definitely. >> Cool. Um thank you very much for the super chats. The first one is thoughts on Oh, we were just talking about this. Thoughts on Sharda against Dango to double up with Thiago? Thinking Enzo to one of them in 28? >> I think I just take the money. >> Is it seven 58? Is it >> 69? Yeah. So, it's a million 1.1 saving. >> I would take Dango. I'd probably take Dango regardless. >> Yeah. Yeah, I probably would. >> Shard's numbers, to be fair, are hugely inflated because when he scored that hattrick, he had three xG. [snorts] >> That's crazy. >> That's three goals from 3xG. Perfect. >> Um, and then the second super chat, two free transfers. >> Sorry, what were you going to say? >> Yeah, the same this the other super chat. I would definitely do Taroski Ku to Hill Thiago 100%. I'd do Taroski to anyone at this point. Yeah, Harry was asking before the stream where where's Guill gone? So, >> he he hasn't been seen. Maybe he'll start against Hull on Friday. >> I mean, he's better than Dap. So, uh we should be starting with [snorts] Dap coming off the bench, but anyway, >> what could have been Guill at Sunderland? What could have been? Um yeah, that's about it, I think. >> Yeah, that is all. Of course, lots of football to go tonight and tomorrow night and then next week. Uh we'll be back next Wednesday just before the Wolves game to talk again. Um enjoy your weekend. Enjoy the FA Cup and good luck with the rest of game 26. Thank you, Tom. Please do like and subscribe before you go and yeah, we'll catch you next week. >> Yeah. Uh someone in the chat saying there's one guy up front who scored one open play goal in seven games you could sell. That's Mr. Harland. But >> yeah, but he's on pens. >> We'll see him out score Gabrielle this week, I'm sure. >> And he's uh too busy creating XA for all his teammates. >> Yeah, five assists now. Um but yeah, thanks Harry. Um search Army Jobs if that interests you. Thank you to them for their support and we will see you guys next Wednesday. Enjoy tonight and Gabrielle's bullet header tomorrow.",

    "transcript": "[music] [music] party. Hey Hello and welcome to another video and podcast from Fantasy Football Scout. My name is Joe and as ever, I'm joined by Neil, Fantasy Football Scouts editor to discuss all the latest team news and injury developments ahead of the deadline. Neil, welcome. How are you? Not >> too bad, Joe. Yeah, still full of cold call, so apologize for the pronunciation, but it's uh it's usually terrible anyway, so >> Okay, that's fine. We we'll just pretend they're all from Birmingham then the ones that you uh mess up there. Um okay uh just before we go just mind do press that like button does help us out and also do remember to subscribe to wherever you receive your podcast and also subscribe to our video channel at YouTube. Um also welcome all those joining us in the live chat. JM Moore Histori Films Kenya um uh Sonic Revelations uh Jack J77 Lag Dennis and many more. Thanks so much uh for joining us early on. Okay, let's get cracking. Uh Chelsea against leadeds. What's the latest from Chelsea? Yeah, this is one of 10 press conferences we had yesterday because of the uh Tuesday night matches coming up this evening. Uh Ree James has recovered from the knock that he had, but now he's ill. So um still some doubt about his involvement. Rinia was hopeful, but obviously there is still some lingering doubt there. Mhm. >> Um Tossin and Lavia are back in training. Lavia's not going to be involved, but Tossin could be. He hasn't been out for long, so he's back in the in the group. >> Um Andreas has finally took it off the ankle on Saturday, but he's he's recovered. Co Palmer's available as well. >> Yep. >> After he got an hour at Mu and then just the longer term ones, Gittens, Sugo, Cowwell, and Mudriick, who suspended, they're out still. >> Okay. And as for leads, what's the latest there? Yeah, Pascal Stroke has joined Anton Stack on the injury list, but apart from that, everyone should be available and that includes Dominic Calvin Lim who cleared through illness on Friday. >> Righty, let's have a look at Everton against Bournemouth. Um, what's the latest from Everton and in particular with uh mine? So, I'm a Michael Keane owner, but I'm probably going to get rid of him. Uh, because I I've got a sense he's not going to start this one. And Branthweight might get the nod. But I don't know if you have any steer on that or any other developments there at Everton. >> Yeah, injury wise, it's pretty um good. Only Jack Reish is out and he's out for the season now. That's been confirmed. As you say, because of the the numbers that Moyes has got, there's some uncertainty about who starts at the back. So, Branweight was the full guy in game 25, but that was just because Everton looking after his minutes. He's back from well months and months and months out >> and he'd already started twice in quick succession. So he dropped to the bench the weekend but Moy said after that match that he wouldn't see he couldn't see any problem for Tuesday for Branuade. Um yesterday he did say that they're trying to gauge the minutes of the likes of Branu Jbury Hall Alcar the ones who have been out for a while and had come back. >> But yeah again I'll repeat what I said on on Friday. I think El Bubble, who's usually bang on with information on Everton on Twitter, had suggested that Keane was going to be dropping out originally and gave me 24 >> before Melenko got injured, but now Melenko was fit. >> So Keane was meant to be the the makeway out of that five, >> but he had a state of execution. So yeah, I think it's possibly a matter of time. Everton did win without Brweight but if you saw the match which I did afterwards watched the watch the game on delay they were battered in the first half Fulham should have been three or four up so it wasn't [clears throat] particularly defensively sang so a little bit concerned for Ke >> okay right yeah I think I will move him on um possibly for a Bournemouth defender but I don't know about Bournemouth um they traditionally tend to concede a few they may win but concede a few when they've got a midweek game in quick succession uh because they've got quite a thin squad at the moment because of injuries. But yeah, what is the latest from Bournemouth? >> No fresh concerns, but did say fatigue could be a factor and he said he probably won't repeat the same start in 11. >> Okay, >> could be a bit of rotation there. Uh David Brooks, he was back on the bench and gave me 25 and will probably be there again. He says he's not 100%. Tiveria and Adams, they're closed in on returns. Too soon definitely for Tiveria. He's not in training and in fact game 27 might come too soon for him but Adams is nearly back. Um they're going to they were going to assess him in training yesterday to see if he could feature. >> Mhm. >> Probably on the bench. Clut and Gan and Do are all out still as well. >> Did they Did they give any indication or is there any indication from previous um matches like who could be um uh rotated in this one? >> Um not really. Um Gimenez was cramping at the weekend. Um so he could drop out I suppose. So was Ryan the new winger. >> Okay. >> They were both suffering from cramp later in the game. Uh previously in um busy gimmicks IA has rotated his um attack more than defense. >> Okay. >> Uh I think Neilson's dropped to the bench once. This is the first time we've seen Kirby really sort of have a stained run 11. So we'll see if he okay he's um the thing is he has been coming off early in every single game. he's been pulled off like out of the team from about 60 70 minutes >> in every game. So, um uh we'll see. But yeah, could be could be a number of different permutations on it. >> Okay. And let's go with Tottenham against Newcastle. Um two teams well your team Newcastle not so great away. Um Spurs not so great. Full stop. Um so what what is the latest from Spurs? I know there'll be about Romero um because he's been naughty again. Yeah. Yeah. He's he's going to be serving a four match ban. Further problems at the back. Destiny and doggies out for four, five weeks with a hamstring injury. And they've got I think is it nine others on the injury list too. Dano, Berg, Val, Porro, Davies, Charison, Benton, Kudus, Madison, and Kulfki. They do get one player back and that is Jed Spence who is available after a short-term cough problem. >> Okay. Righty. Oh. Um and as for your team Newcastle, um Anthony Gordon gone into this as a bit of a doubt. Um he and others are they um available? >> Uh looks slightly better on Gordon and Miley. Um they both missed out the weekend. How said yesterday that he's going to um await an update on Miley because he got a nasty bang in his leg. Was it's a dead leg basically. It's strangled a little bit longer than we thought. >> Gordon they were hoping for a big improvement on. Craig hope from the male reckons they're both actually quite close to um coming back possibly for tonight. So we might see them in the squad. We won't see Joel in still out alongside Fabian Sher Emil Craft and Tino Never. >> Okay. Righty. Oh, let's move on to West Ham against Manchester United. Um yeah, what's the latest from West Ham? Um uh yeah. >> Yeah. Yeah. there is some players are going to be missing if you believe Nuno but he wouldn't say who which is not unusual for him. Um he said we're going to have some players out unfortunately with Nox. >> Uh and he yeah wouldn't elaborate. It's been a guessing game on on social media and the West Ham forums as you can imagine. Lots of groundless guesses. Um we there was um clips of of Pablo limping after the game. He didn't actually start anyway and Jif was down on the floor for quite a while needing treatment. But again, it's it's speculation at this point. The closer we get to kick off the more we may get actual leaks because um the likes of ex West Ham employee tends to maybe get a heads up on the team. So >> keep our eyes posted on that. >> Tibbo is suspended still. This is the last league game he'll be banned for and he'll finish his ban in the FA Cup. >> Okay. Yeah. Last I heard from uh the that um tweeter that you mentioned that I saw something that he was saying that um a lot of those that had been possible doubts had actually been pictured in training. Um >> I think everyone bar Pablo and and Trayori I think were pictured. >> Yeah. Um >> yeah show uh Manchester United now we saw um Bernard Burma limping away from the stadium last time out but then we've seen I've seen p well p pictures p pictures p pictures p pictures p pictures p pictures p pictures p pictures p pictures p pictures in training where he's been running but rather jolly and um and bearing in mind Aguero and Sacka always used to limp uh when the final whistle went anyway and still scored a hattick next game but yeah what what is the latest there? >> Yeah, no mention of him by Carrick yesterday. Um and I think he was spotted in the traveling party for the West Ham game. So that's hopefully boards well. >> Mhm. >> Could still be some rotation. There being a short turnaround. Um but might get two weeks off after this. So that's uh that is something. >> Okay. >> Um otherwise it's as you were. So dog and definitely out and implying that it'll again come too soon for me. >> Okay. Right. Let's go with Aston Villa Brighton. Now I have no tweets but these may have been late ones coming in. >> I know Herz was at 3:00 10 minutes ago. >> Yeah. >> Speaking as we speak. >> Okay. Well, let's go with Aston Villa first because I think that was a little well about half an hour or so ago, but I have time to put the tweets up. >> Yeah. Um Emry said that they're going to he's going to see them the medical team for some small not issues, but didn't again didn't say who. Uh otherwise, there wasn't much team news actually. He just he talked of the long-term one still being out. >> Mhm. >> Uh so we assume that will be what? Tieleman's, [clears throat] excuse me. Uh, who else we got? Uh, let me find the post. Uh, lost my uh lost my TV news article. Oh, there we go. Yeah, Garcia, Kamara, Tieman's, McInn, and Allison were the ones already out. Allison was in training, I think. So, he's the closest, but yeah, not much. >> Okay. Rightyo. Um, as for Brighton, um, Herzler, I I presume he's still Bryant manager after the disgrace of the weekend. Yeah, he's speaking now. So, um, we'll come back to him. Okay. Uh, at the end of this and see if you got any quotes through um, >> right? Yeah. >> From the likes of Andy. >> I hope he's saying I'm not going to play 12-year-old boys anymore. I'm going to play Danny Wellbeck instead. Uh, but, uh, maybe not. Uh, let's go with Crystal Palace, who got the better of my team, annoyingly. Um, Crystal Palace, what's the latest there? Big news with Betetta, actually. Yeah, he doesn't need surgery, which is the good news, but the bad news is from his perspective and maybe palaters if they want him, uh, is that he's still out and will be for an indeterminate period. Um, I couldn't say if it was going to be two, three or four weeks, but he doesn't need an operation at least and he'll be rehabbing at the training ground. Definitely out of this one. Dei could return. He's the only one I think who could be back. Um, not that they've got many left on the injury list actually. Dorian and Kenny are the senior ones who are still out. >> Okay. Righty and as for Burnley. >> Yeah. Uh Parker says said nothing new to report. No one coming back either. So um Treso Cullen by Robert Zamun. He had been out long term. Tanzi was a um surprise absentee last weekend with an Achilles problem. Um and given that part said he wasn't expect anyone back. We assume that includes him as well. They do get one player available which they didn't have in game 25 and that is James Wardprow. So he can play now. Haven't been ineligible to face West Ham last weekend. >> Okay. Right. Let's move to Man City uh Fulham. Okay. Man City, what's the latest there? >> Yeah, double boost at center half. Um Kenov's fine. He took a a blow to the face against Liverpool, but he's not concussed and he's available. And John Stones is is back too. We haven't seen him in a long time. He has trained and he is uh back fit I would say was was Pep's word. So not quite match fit I think but um maybe in the squad. And then he said everyone else is going to assess and training. I think we're coming around about the time of of Do and Sabinho's um recovery period. So it's just about the end from where we were expecting them to be. So they may be close but uh um given that Pep voluntarily offered up the information on Stones maybe it's just too soon for those two. >> Okay. >> And then Gavardio and Kitch are out as well. >> Okay. And we'll go with Fulham. That's usually quite a short one because they've miraculously usually injuryfree. Well mainly >> yeah they are they are again there just just two to report. Um Sata Lucich and Tom Kenny they were both absent at the weekend and they remain so but nothing new. All the others there. >> Okay. >> Okay. Now, Nottingham Forest Wolves. Non Forest. Another um late one or perhaps not at all. Um but um yeah, I don't know anything from Ning Forest. Has anything come in for that? >> Yeah, this was yesterday. Um this was uh yet Matt Sales looks set to miss out again >> by the sounds of what Sean D was saying. They're not sure what the extent is, but it's not going to be days. >> Okay. called Savona Wood and John are out as well. Milo, he was a surprise absentee last week. >> Um and he remains touch and go and when B says touch and go, it's generally um not going to happen. >> Go. >> We'll see what happens with that tonight. Um Nikico Williams is back. They do get one defender back. He is available after a more match ban. >> Okay. And for Wolves, I did see this one though. Uh what is the latest from Wolves? Yeah, double game week. Uh, one of two double game week sides. Uh, Huang is not going to be part of that double game week. He's going to miss a number of weeks with a calf injury that he sustained at the weekend. Uh, Totty Gomez is getting closer, which probably means not for this one, but possibly for the the second game week 22nd, sorry, game week 26 match. And then Andre, he sat out game week 25 with a minor car injury and they're going to assess him today. >> Okay. Right. Let's move to Sunderland against Liverpool. Um yeah, latest from Sunderland. >> Not much. Uh nothing new reported although seeing that uh Reggie Libbury wasn't wasn't asked if there was any fresh concerns. He did give us an update on Jaca and Trayori. They're both still out um potentially back for game week 27. >> Okay. And as for Liverpool in the in the chaos of the final few minutes of that Liverpool game, uh it loo was was back. got a red card. Um so um yeah, he's serving a ban. Just one match though, I think. But yeah, what what what uh what else on him and anyone else at Liverpool? >> Yeah, like you say, just a just a one match ban for denial of goal scoring opportunity. >> Um and it's a bit of a headache at right back. Yeah, because Fog and Bradley are already out and then Gomez who could possibly fill in there as well. He had yet to train with his teammates um as of this morning, but slots said he could possibly do so this afternoon. Even so, it's probably still going to be too soon for him to start. So, that's four right back options they've got have got out or not able to start. I'm including Shabbos in that. So, it's going to be probably either Curtis Jones or Wataru Endo um was what Slot was saying. Both of actually featured at right back this season. >> Other than that, nothing new reported. Isach Lei uh Bic and Dans are still out. >> Okay. Righty. And now Brenford and Arsenal that's not till Thursday. So we've got nothing from them yet I think. But is there anything um that that's come in or just any indication who might possibly start this one? Not just with Brenford but I think Arsenal really the key one because of the double game week. Yeah, with Arsenal obviously we've not had anything from Arta and even when he does speak he doesn't tend to be that helpful. Um, Saka was previously earmarked for I think for a game 27 return. At least that's what the media was suggesting. >> Altera hasn't confirmed that timeline. So we think he might miss gaming 27 or at least the first half of it. Odigard last Friday was a matter of days. So possibility he could be back. Trosard seemed to hobble off against Sunderland the weekend. Um I've seen a calf injury reported but it could just be cramp. The problem is we're not going to get an update before the deadline and Din and Marino there. Um they were already red flag. Um yeah, I mean in terms of starting level it's just you'll probably go as strong as how injuries allow him. Um because it's a it's a Sunday or Saturday turnaround which is very generous. >> Yeah. >> And then b they're playing we athletic in the FA Cup fourth round and they're not just a league one sign but a struggling league one sign. >> So he's going to put the kids out for that one. No the reserves. No guard, >> Ben White probably, um, Jesus, maybe Ez. >> Yeah. >> So, I think he'll go full strength for the for the, um, for the Brenford game and then it's just a matter of who's fit. As for Brenford, >> um, Shard is still banned. So, this is again like Tony for West Ham. This is the last game of his last league game of his three match ban. The third one will be served in the FA Cup. >> Okay. >> So, it'll be available for game 27. And then injuries all we're aware of is Carvalio Dilva and Malambo >> all got long-term me injuries. There is one player who can't feature beyond that and that is Reese Nelson who is on loan from Arsenal. So he's ineligible. >> Okay. Right. Yeah. Okay. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to round up what we've got so far and in that meantime you can um have a look to see what Herzel has been saying. Um so um yeah the round up so far what we've got um Jed Spence is available. Tossen should be back. Um whether he'll start or not, we don't know. Lavia as well is available. Palmer [snorts] is available just in case those that thought his 60-minute substitution was injury related. Not at all. He was just managing his minutes. Um Calvat Leuen is available. Grev is back is available rather and Kusenov is available as is Stones. We may be seeing him. I don't know. Um questionable though. Reys James as ever. It's illness this time. is actually injury-free, but those those that follow this will know that he's very unfortunate there. He's now got an illness. Miley and Gordon are to be assessed, so we don't know about them. Major doubt Mount's gone knock, so it's very unlikely we're going to see him. Joe Gomez as well hasn't trained yet. Um, so there could be some real right back issues there because Bradley is out. Fong um and um Sabos as well who fills in there. Um, so I'll come back to Neil in a sec to who might play there. Um, uh, Romero has been naughty. I'll just put there he's out four games because he's so naughty. Uh, doggy got hamstring problems. Strike has joining stack on the injury list for lead. So Bosley, as we've just said, one match ban. Huang calf problems. Uh, Mateta, I put Mata in there. He's been out for a little while, but he the speculation was he had needed surgery. He doesn't. Um, so you should be out for weeks. Um, rather than as we thought like the rest of the season. Um, and Shaka is still out for Sunderland with ankle problems. Um, yeah, back to Neil with for anything from Brighton. >> Unfortunately not. He's running late. Um, according to Brian at the Yos who's live on the on the website. So he's running late. [laughter] >> My former colleague. >> He can't help us out today unfortunately because her is is tardy. So, um, go to the Yeah, I'll direct people to the website because we've got a team news blog up there and I'll update that when when Brighton's >> information arrives. >> Okay. Herzler does cycle to the office, so maybe he got caught in some traffic there and the the neverending rain that we're getting here. Yeah, I mentioned about um um Solos being out and virtually everyone else who plays right back for for Liverpool. Who could play right back there? Would it be Jones or >> Yeah, we mentioned that in the um just a little bit earlier there. stop start stop name checking these two endor or or got it'll probably it'll probably be J. >> Yeah, I just wanted to sort of reiterate that there. Um okay. Um I think we got everything there. Um thanks a lot for joining me. Um eagle-eyed viewers may notice my dog has been sleeping throughout this as well. So um I hope you found it interesting even if my my uh little dog uh there has found it really boring. [laughter] So take care. Good luck with the game. Good luck with the double game week. Um we'll see you again ahead of the um next game week which geek 27 next week. See you soon. >> Bye for now.",

    "transcript": "Hello and welcome to another video and podcast from Fantasy Football Scout. My name is Joe and today I'm joined by Fantasy Football Scout deputy header Tom Freeman revealing his double game week 2016. Welcome Tom. How are you? >> Yeah, I'm good, thanks Joe. Yeah, we've got obviously a quick turnaround this week. I haven't actually made any transfers and um I think I know what I'm going to do, but I'm not totally sure. So, it' be good to have a chat through that now. >> Yes, definitely. So, yeah, it's um obviously Arsenal and Wolves double this week, so they're front of uh mind for everyone, but of course, we've got to think about upcoming fixtures as well. There's a blank gameweek in gameweek 31 for Wolves Arsenal because they're doubling now. And also Man City and CH and Crystal Palace who are also in the League Cup final, but they can't double uh yet. So their double is going to be after 31, but they're defin well they're 99.9% going to blank there. I don't think they're fully going to blank. >> Yeah, I think they need to go out of Europe and a FA Cup or something. It sounds very unlikely. Um but there is a very small chance. >> Yeah, they're pretty much going to blank. So we can we can safely say that. Just before we go on, just mind do press that like button does help us out. Do me subscribe, keep update our latest videos and podcasts and do check out latest membership offers fancy.co.uk UK to get access to all latest tools and gadgets to help you climb up your mini leagues. Um, okay. Let's see how you got on this week. So, um, Red Arrow, but it's a small red arrow, I believe, with 64 points. >> Yeah, I've had a good run recently, so I can't have too many complaints, Joe. But yeah, it was, um, yeah, it wasn't a great week. I think you you had a really good week, didn't you, Joe? What did you get? 80 something. >> 80 something. Yeah. Yeah. But well, thanks to you were literally the only other person who benefited from why I did okay as well. It was Dallow, but obviously I had Rogers as well, which helped out and a few other um players that that it felt like I'd hauled you back in and then you've kind of got ahead again a little bit now. But yeah, it started off well, didn't it Joe, with we both had Bruno captain and we both had Dallow and I think I was up to about 200k overall rank at that point. But then not a lot happened after that as you can see there and missed out on Rogers. Of course, Thiago got that goal as well, didn't he? Which is always a bit of a rank killer when you don't own him. >> Um so yeah, not a great week, but um I rolled the transfer. I've got three free transfers now. And um >> team looks okay, I think, for for the upcoming week. Do you need me to run through the uh the points now or? >> Uh no, it's very I'll quickly I'll just quickly mention the players you've got as well. So I mean the focus is the next week, so we'll focus on that bit. But yeah, you had the bravkin goal for a blank. Dallow legend 12 points in hardly any team. So it's literally you and me benefited there. And blank, Gabrielle return, great. Rice, uh, small return, five points. Seno Blank, Fernandez, brilliant captaincy, 20 points. Thank you. Enzo Blank, Harland 11 points. So he only missed out slightly by not captaining him. Ekat blank sadly. Um, could have got a hall though. And Bowen blanked again on the bench. Cells sitting there rotting away there. Richards looking good um for this week. Uh Mi and and Shaka there. So the Sunderland lads on the bench for this time round. So let's have a look at how this is going to look in gameweek 26. Um so do you you want to run us through the team now and your decisions? So captaincy, whether to use a chip, triple captaincy, which you you've got three free transfers. >> Um so you can make some moves as well. So yeah, what's what's what are your thoughts? >> Yeah, there's a lot to think about this week, isn't there? So I've got um I've got Cells in goal at the moment at home to Wolves, but he's actually been ruled out. He's going to he's going to be sold this week. >> Um the back line I'm I'm happy with. I've got Gabrielle who's got the double game week obviously got the captain on him at the moment. Um I'll play Dallow away at West Ham. >> Uh and Richards who's got that really good home fixture against Burnley. um four across midfield. Rice double game week. Uh Semeno at home to Fulham, Enzo at home to Leads and Fernandez at home to West Ham. So that feels pretty strong. Uh and then Harland up front against Fulham, Ekit away at Sunderland and Bowen at home against Man United. And then on the bench I've got Dravka, Mulele, Anderson and Jaca who will also miss out. >> So I've got three free transfers. I've got 0.2 million in the bank. So the the first thing is third Arsenal player. Yeah. to come in. And we discussed it a bit before we came on this video, but I think with my setup, I need a new goalkeeper. It makes sense to go to Ryer. I think he'll help me in blank game week 31 as well because I can park him on the bench um without eating to the outfield players. Um so Ryer will come in for sells. Um but I need to make 1.1 million, >> right? >> Um to make that move doable. So, at the moment, I think I'm going to sell Bowen um and I'm going to drop him down to I think Strand Lson. Um I watched them against your team Brighton on Sunday and I thought, >> you know, it's going to take a bit of time to build that chemistry, but I thought there were kind of promising signs there. He had he had that decent chance at the end which were bugen saved from the the moon crossed. He's got Burnley and Wolves at home in the next two. I think the team is okay with gamew week even bringing in a Palace player now knowing that I've got Richards I think I can do it with I think I'll be okay for blank game week 31 we've got a few weeks before that I can obviously look to move on maybe Smeno um as well during that time >> um so that's the kind of that's where I'm at at the moment use the two free transfers by bringing Ryer and Strand Larsson in and then rolling the third one for next week when I'll have two free transfers again and Then I can look at maybe Thiago, I can look at Dangoara, those kind of players to to capitalize on that Brenford run. >> Okay. Um, so yeah, to some thoughts there. One one related to my own team. I've got Michael Keane. I'm looking to move on. Um, I was going to go for Hill at Bournemouth, but I just think I'd need to play the sort of immediate fixtures and I think a Palace defender does look good. Um, what they it was a tricky the the tie against my team Brian was a tricky one to judge because Brian were awful. Crystal Palace were were better obviously they won. >> Um but they weren't amazing but what they were good at two things. One one thing as you said with Strand Len he has the potential massive hall potential because they are geared up in a structure to feed him potentially. >> Exactly. >> Um S did get the goal but um yeah he can get assists as well. Um, but also the other thing is when when they went up, I think it was 60th minute or something like that, but for that remainder of 30 minutes, Brighton had no shots. >> Now that's on that's that's partly on Brighton being rubbish, >> but that is also partly on Crystal Palace totally shoring that up. >> Yeah. >> And that I like. So Crystal Palace have Burnley at home or Wolves at home. It literally does not get better than that. Then Manchester United, Tottenham bench them, then leads at home. Brilliant. play them and then you got Man City gaming 31 which they're not going to play so they're blank. So the question I ask is I'm tempted to get I can go right up to Lacra. I can't get Munos. Munos would be the ideal. Um is is Lacra worth that 7 over Richards because I think I might just go for Richards. >> I don't think he is. I think his defa 90 is slightly more but it's not massively more. No. um and potentially not enough to warrant that seven. I I I mean I've got Richards in my team. >> Um >> money isn't as important this year, but I think if you you know it might be in future game weeks. So I would >> I'd personally bank that money and go Richards, I think. Um >> and Glazner spoke about it after the game at the weekend. He was saying the defense is the foundation of everything we've good good we've done in the past couple of years. It feels like it it felt like Sunday was a bit of a back to basics approach and I think Palace have been really rubbish for a while now. But I think that that derby win, the fact that they've got Strand Lson who's come in, they've got some new signings. Gassan's gone in, Johnson's gone in, it feels like maybe there's a bit more of a feel-good factor at the club now after a really bad period. Um, and I think that Yeah, I think I think Sar will probably take the next penalty over Strand Larson. Yeah. Um but maybe Strand Larson against teams who are gonna sit s won't have as much space as he did as he did against Brighton. He can of course do really well but maybe maybe Strand Lson will benefit from this Burnley game more. Um so I think I'm the only other move which I did did look at Joe um is to do the three transfers and by I to get that 1.1 million from going from sells to Ryer I could sell Joe Chim Anderson and I could sell Granite Jhaka who are both on my bench and go really cheap. >> Yeah. >> So I so I could basically go down to like a Mayu or something and then like a really cheap defender. But I don't think Bowen has really done enough. He's done okay for me recently, but I think he was a bit lucky at Chelsea with that goal he scored. He got the penalty before that. So, I think dropping down to Strandlarsson probably makes most sense. >> Yeah, I think so. Um, yeah, looking like I mean, yeah, Bowen there is I mean Bowen is a good player. He could stay there. >> Um, but if you're looking I mean you're looking at the rest of the team obviously you got the double players there. You've got the likes of Enzo who's still got you know a couple of good fixtures coming up for Chelsea leadeds and Burnley at home. Um you're looking at those and whom go yeah I mean I I personally would do that move with with Rya sells Bowen to >> Strand Lson. Um >> you could but what we're going to do is we're going to look at some forwards. Okay. >> So we're going to look at some forwards here because that's what you're looking at there. So you're looking at Stan Lson. See so I've got a table. Now I showed this on FPL general's show. Um but we can talk we can look at this and mention some of the players. Now, Stran Larson's not on this list because he just hasn't had the minutes per expected goal involvement recently. He just wolves matches. But the first thing before we look at some of the the actual players as well is a sort of a meta point of 343 or 352. So, a lot of people this week you could go for Manet for example. He has a double game but he does blank in for Wolves and he does blank in 31. But there you could actually play him this week in a in a 343 but then bench him there on if you've got a good fifth of midfielder for example or you could go for three up front and I personally advocate that I've got a TK Thiago and and Harland and I think that's going to be the one that all the content creators are going to go for from gaming 27 onwards because of the fixtures. But what where what are you thinking now because you're at that crossroads you can you can go either way. Yeah, it feels like I've been wanting to move to a 352 for a while and then just had other transfers to make. Now suddenly, like you say, the 343 looks a bit more appealing because I think everybody's going to want Thiago soon. Everybody's going to keep Harland and then Ekit. The next two are okay fixtures. They're away at Sunderland and Forest, but after that, the fixtures get really good for Liverpool. Isak still isn't there. Ech still getting chances, even against City at the weekend. He probably should have scored from that header. Mhm. >> Um, so yeah, I'm even though I'm dropping down to string last, I'm still going to have three playing forwards and probably stay in that 343 structure. I think a 4-33 is fine as well. Um, but yeah, that that that's probably what I'm going to do. Um, >> which seems, you know, we haven't spoken about three forwards a lot this forward because of the strength of Defcon, have we? >> Um, but maybe for this little period leading up to the blanket, it makes sense to do that. Yeah, I mean I've I've accidentally found myself with that in that I had those three strikers and and then that they kept doing something to make me want to keep them. >> So I'd never have never moved off 343. Um but um but I can Yeah, I've always wanted to but now now I feel okay with it. >> Yeah, but so so stats wise, Echitique, he's got the two goals. This is over the last six um game weeks. Okay, so ETK is top in terms of minutes per expected goal involvement on penalties. He's getting one every match or so. Um and he's had 15 shots, create four chances, two goals. Um Thiago, six goals over that time, which is astounding doing exactly what you want for him. got Watkins as well from side Villa but I guess he's got Tammy Abrahams that can come in and when Champions League starts up again. Aan Nilson at Bournemouth I think you got Krooppy who can who can play and is is doing well as well. So Krooppy's got three goals. So is Aan Nilson and you can save a couple of million. So I quite like that. Then you got Harland obviously we know what he's about. Two goals, two assists so far and this is him in bad form uh with his 20 shots. Jockarez could be an intriguing one for this week alone. I like the Jockarez habits combination that I've been seeing recently. >> Yeah, >> but I don't know whether they'll start both of those. And then you got J Pedro once again. He's got these two great fixtures. He's doing the Brighton things as in winning penalties, not taking them this time. Winning them. And you got Manet there with his three attacking returns. Not recently, but three attacking returns. 18 shots. Not too shabby. So, you got a lot of choice. But I think I like your idea of having getting Rya in and downgrading Bowen. I don't know about Strand Larsson though. I mean I I'd be tempted to just really target the fixtures. I don't know whether I mean what was Bowen's I don't know what Bowen's price is again now. It's uh >> 7.7 is it I think >> something like you know just the next two fixtures Jal Pedro the next fixture Manet can't get to >> I don't think yeah the only I did look at J Pedro a lot actually. The only way I can get Jel Pedro is by selling Akitik. I can't do it in two moves with with going he's just that bit too um yeah free up the money don't you >> man is a totally fair shout I could drop down to that cheaper forward um I don't know that fixture against Arsenal I mean he'll get appearance points but um >> and what you know he's he's shooting a lot man but a lot of them from outside the box you might get lucky against Forest they haven't been great defensive recently >> um but no there's there's a lot of choices there I think If if I could reach J Pedro instead, I'll probably go for him, but that isn't doable in the two moves. Um, Krooppy, his minutes aren't great, but while he's starting, you can't really argue with it for 4.7, can you? Um, Joarez, a lot of transfers in for him this week. >> Looks good for for the Brenford game. Beyond that, >> minutes maybe. I'm not totally sure. Will Jay's coming in the FA Cup and then join next week as well, maybe. >> Maybe. But then but then after that is he going to become a problem again? >> It's a maybe isn't it? And that's why I like a kit Thiago Harland. Um yeah >> there because you know what you're getting as I said they've been my team and haven't wanted to get rid of them and that says something if you if you don't want to get rid of them. >> That says something. We're going to look at some the goals. We're not going to have a goals imminent podcast. So we're going to have a look at some of the players on the goals imminent assist imminent. See if there's any differentials. Some of them will be forwards you could target, but this is for for everyone really. And I think particularly with game 27 in mind when we're looking to make some changes um as well. Before we do that though, I just wanted to return quickly to your team because you got the captaincy on Gabrielle and I know this has been spoken about in a lot of podcast, but are you I've got the triple captain on Gabrielle at the moment and it's looks like it's going to stay that way. Are you tempted to do that or are you going to just stick with Gabrielle? And also, what about Rice as well? Yeah, it's I've been going back and forth on this, Joe. The thing that the the other opportunity will probably be in gameweek 36 because I'll probably bench boost when in the double before that. >> I'm not super excited about Gabrielle this week. But the problem is is that we just don't know >> what that double is going to look like in 36. So, there is a bit of, you know, will there be a better opportunity? We don't actually know because City might not have anything to play for by the time we get to 36. I can see Arsenal wrapping up the league before then to be honest. Um because they're just so stingy and kind of consistent and getting results. So I mean last year I got to gameweek 38 and I hadn't played the triple captainship and I went with Bowen and it worked out on the last day of the season. >> I am tempted to do it now because >> we just don't know what's ahead. Um, Rice, I don't know if I'm quite there with triple captain in Rice. Um, you know, he's got he's been really creative recently. There isn't a great deal of goal threat. You might get lucky. Of course, he can get defcons, but you've got Gabrielle there. He's like, >> well, he's one of the top scorers in the game. Um, I can actually see Arsenal conceding against Brenford on Thursday, but then they've got that Wolves game as well who haven't got a great deal of goal threat. And I suppose if he comes out with, you know, if he gets a clean sheet and maybe Defcon in one of those games or two. >> Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. You're probably looking at a pretty decent triple captain hall. >> Maybe, you know, I mean, scoring would be the dream, but maybe um he'll catch um from a corner. He'll catch on his head and then it'll bounce to someone else and maybe get this because he's always in the mix. Yeah, I can see him getting 10 maybe one clean sheet defcon and then you might get a bit of bonus on top of that as well. And and if he does that and you're getting 30 points or something, you're probably going to be okay with that. And so, >> yeah, if I knew what was going to happen in gameweek 36 and I could weigh it up and I could think, well, might be better opportunities, but it's just that uncertainty. So, maybe I will go with it. I'll probably say I'm 1730 to do it at the moment >> that that all all the issues I've I've thought about as well. And I just thought um leaving it until potentially on Harland in 36 ahead of a potential FA Cup final. Will Harland be rested? I'm just I just know that just sounds like a massive headache. >> Yeah. And I don't want to get into that position. I think we both played our chips really late in the first half of the season, didn't we, Joe? >> I think I play it too late. >> Yeah. And I think I probably did as well. We did okay with our bench boosts. I think okay in the end >> but it's just that kind of you're waiting and again there was uncertainty with what we were doing. We didn't know which weeks we were going to bench boost in. And I think now we've got a good opportunity to play. Not a great opportunity but a decent opportunity. >> Um and there's quite a few people with triple Arsenal defense and do I want to go up against triple Arsenal defense with triple captains in play as well? >> Yeah. >> You know I'm in a position where I need to kick on really now. Um so yeah, kind of tempted to play it this week. Yeah, there are there are some sort of geared up for a bench boost this week. FPL general for one, but he's planned it. So, it's not something you can say, oh, you could consider it because you I 99% of teams just will not have prepared for it and we're going to have like your Sunderland defenders and things like that. >> Well, he wild carded, did he wild card? >> He wild card in 24. Yeah. >> So, he set that up with this in mind. Yeah. >> But the good thing about the bench boost in 33 this time, so it's the week after we would potentially wild card in 32. And it's different this year because this year we've got all of these cheap players from good sides. We've got the Bravka playing getting save points. We've got Anderson at Nottingham Forest getting a floor of four point. He just shows up. He he showed up for me the other day. He just got seven points just for turning up walking through the door. >> Yeah. And a really poor performance by Forest. >> Um >> so we've got these cheap players. We've got Debury Hall who can get double digit returns at the drop of value. >> Yeah, there's a lot of value out there, isn't there? >> And then that's not even the same. Mi um >> um all all of the leads defense as well. Ro Joe Rodong. >> Yeah, he got the boat. He got the defcon, didn't he? After the update at the weekend, >> he defied OPA. OPA said, \"No, you've got no defcon.\" fancy foot FPL said no no defcon and Joe >> said go and have another look >> I think you'll find I think you need a bit of a recount chums and you know he's great but we didn't have that last year so there that's good but anyway that's an aside okay let's have a quick look before we go imminent few names on here to consider Ral Gimenez was briefly on my side I I regretted getting rid of him I got rid of him >> and then he kept scoring and scoring and scoring um and he still is so he's got a goal he's on the goals eminent table because there's more to come he should got at least another goal over this period according to the expected stats. 11 shots, all bar two of them inside the box. >> Um, four on target. >> Um, yeah, he's 6.2. He's within your budget. >> He is. My only concern with him is Munit came off the bench the other day and we might see Roy has played a lot of minutes when he's been out. I think the time was to go to route for was a few weeks ago. He probably probably done okay out of it. Um, >> okay. But when he plays, he's involved, isn't he? >> Yeah, definitely. Um, yeah, I I I think one of the things he'll either come on or he'll either come on for Mooney is or he'll um uh start and then come off in >> and even when he and even when he is a sub, he probably will get 25 minutes off the bench. >> Yeah. >> You know, they're come they're going to make that change because Mun isn't going to suddenly be up to speed to play 90 minutes. And after they get Man City out the way, Sunderland, Tottenham, West Ham, Nottingham Forest, Burnley that he could score in every single one of those games. >> Yeah. Well, I was thinking of rem Anderson and those fixtures exactly like you say there, Joe. I had a look at those and thought, I know Fulham Fulham have been rubbish recently defensively, but maybe he's worth keeping for a couple. Next name is Salah. It's 14 million. That's why why no one's getting him in >> quietly. He's been quite good recently. Two big chances. Missed both of them. should have got um at least a goal over this period. He's had 10 shots, every single one of them bar one inside the box, just two on target so he can be a bit more uh accurate there. But um he is going to be intriguing after we wild cards as in we'll have a look at the fixtures and he could be intriguing now. Sunderland, non Forest, West Ham, Wolves, I got Ekit, but I can I can see the appeal of Salah. It's just tricky to come in in a week where everyone's focused on Arsenal double game week and Harland's still knocking around, still scoring. >> Yeah. I mean, he could be a really solid differential, but it's hard like it's it's hard to get him and Harland still in the same team, isn't it? >> Yeah. >> Because there are other players who are like seven, eight million who we want at the moment. And that's that's the issue with it. But um maybe further down the line. I don't think I'll bring him in for the next two game weeks for Sunderland and Forest away, but maybe for the home games after that. >> Definitely. Well, he's um yeah, he's due a goal according to this. Evan Nelson, but anyway, this his last four game weeks by the way um for those not familiar with these tables. Uh Evan Nelson um has had four big chances, missed three of them. He's already scored. Should have got getting on for another goal according to expected stats. 11 shots all by one of them inside the box with four on target. These are actually quite good stats with Nelson. you you obviously do the scout reports. >> Um I haven't really he's not really been on my radar, but Evan Nlson is has he got a bit better of late. >> Um yeah, his goal conversion rate is terrible over the season, but he he's been a but unlucky not to return against my team at the weekend and I think the one before that he did okay in. Um, I guess the thing is you've got Krooppy there and I know Evan Nelson's minutes are more secure, but if if Krooppy is getting 60 to 65 minutes each week and he's 4.7, you're probably going to go there over Evan Nelson. And I think Tavanir is back soon. Part of the appeal with Evan Nelson is he probably would have taken penalties. He might still while Tavan's out, but that is coming to an end, I think. >> Uh, Mascara here is 4.3 for Wolves. Um, not in my radar at all. It's a gameweek 31 headache. And Mosca, I don't even know what he is. >> So, he's a he's a center back, but he pushes for I I think over the last seven game weeks, no defender's taken more shots than Mosca. >> 11 shots all by one inside the box. This is good. >> I think it's 14 over the last seven gameweek shots he's had. Um, there was loads of confusion about how many yellow cards he's got. Um, I think the I think somebody said he had gone up to nine. He's not. He's on eight. >> As soon as they get to nine, they're probably not buyers because they're going to get too much b once they get to 10. But it is on eight, so it's still risky. And he does love a yellow card, >> but he's got a bit of goal threat. And he's good for defcons, too. >> He's got he's got Nottingham Forest. He has got Arsenal, >> but he's got Nottingham Forest. >> I don't know. I think if I was free hitting, >> I'd be tempted because if if you look at the if you're thinking, oh, who who's, you know, who I don't I want permanently, but for one week, I think I would tempted to get him. We we put him in the differentials last week um just because those >> when you're lurking in the members area and um you're looking at those shot tallies. Ed Edward spoke about him recently getting forward and um he creates a bit of chaos. He's a bit like Mle in that sense when he gets forward but um >> yeah don't mind that on a free hit. >> Good stuff. Uh we'll have a quick look at the assist imminent table. Um this is good news for those who've got Rice or backing Rice this week for Arsenal. Um the creativity is is immense this week. So he's got no assists and no goals in his last four game weeks. Um but he should have getting on for one to two assists over this period because he's had 13 corners. He's created 13 chances. He's had eight successful crosses. So he is absolutely uh golden here. Um so uh the others I'll mention here and then we'll come back to your thoughts on any of these. Uh Pascal Gross Brighton as a fan I would say no go in FPL. They are absolutely awful and they are second bottom of the fixture ticker. But Gross is a ray of German sunshine into that side. 5.5 created 10 chances, taken a whopping 19 corners, already scored, should have got an assist, and he's had 11 successful crosses as well. Gakpo um is a bit maligned at the moment, but nevertheless, he has created nine chances, taken five corners. Uh Vertz is the one everyone would want. Um and I may indeed get him for with Katique. He's created eight chances, taken to a couple of corners, should have got a little bit of uh more of an assist than he's already got. So, he's got one assist and two goals over this period. Uh Morgan Rogers, um you're a Villa fan, so one of your favorites. He's in my team, so one of my favorites as well. Uh he's taken eight chances as well. He's overperformed, but this is what he does. He defies xG stats here because he gets those kind of shots and assists that no one else can. Uh and Gibbs White as well overperforming >> but Nottingham Forest good but he's just overpriced in 7.3. If he was six million I'd be tempted to get Gibbs White in a good run for Nan Forest but um currently he's got an assist and he should hand back three quarters of it. >> He's got a goal as well. Um so yeah, some some interesting ones there. I think I think for this week knowing that Rice is is very creative and due an assist is is worth and those Liverpool lads for from gameweek well from from now onwards but from gameweek 27 especially look quite good. >> Yeah Rice I'm happy with him and my team this week and Rogers has a really as you'll know Joe has a very good record against Brighton. Um I think he's I think he's returned in his last three games against Brighton with I think I looked yesterday was 27 points in those three games. And and also Ollie I do remember Ollie Ollie Watkins hasn't scored every time but I do remember was it at your place where Brian came up and Ollie Watkins >> just utterly >> destroyed >> singlehandedly destroyed Brian. >> I think it was an early kickoff on the Saturday maybe and >> and then he scor he obviously was in a really bad patch earlier in the season and then went to the AMX and um scored a couple of goals. So, um, yeah, Rogers looks good this week, though, and Rice looks good. Um, I think Verts in a couple of weeks, >> he'll be somebody we're all looking at as well. >> Yeah. Yeah. So, some interesting ones there. Um, well, good luck with the game week. Good luck with your decisions. Uh, it sounds like you're s you're sort of almost there at the moment. We've got team news coming up bit later today. So, this is going to go out as quick as we can. Um, and uh because the deadline is today at half six. So, we've got team news again. That's going to be live streaming. >> Yes. um at 6:00 actually just uh >> Oh, is it 6:00? >> Yeah, cuz it's a 7:30 kick. There's three there's three 7:30 kickoffs tonight. >> Okay. So, yeah, it's very early. So, we'll we'll get this out there. So, we'll we'll we'll take our leave. Um good luck with the game week. We'll see you again next week. Bye now. >> Thanks, Joe.",

    "transcript": "[music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Hello. Hello. Hello and welcome to Scoutcast brought to you by Fantasy Football Scout. As always, you're joined by me, Andy, FPL Mode, and we're also joined by the other Green Arrow gang. Two weeks in a row we've all been on Green Arrows. You don't get that anywhere else. Nacho, how's it going, my man? That 100k is so close. >> It is close, mate. It's been um it's been a good couple of weeks, actually. We just spoke preod. Oh, by the way, good evening to everybody watching, by the way, and stuff. I should probably start that first. Um yeah, we were speaking preod about how I was going into this game week just happy with a gray arrow. It didn't look great, but almost in the week where, you know, we have the premiums, it was the ones outside of those ones, the kind of unexpected ones that kind of carried my game week. And yeah, Green Arrow again. And like I say, as long as all three of us got Green Arrows, I don't care what's going on in the world, I'm a happy man. So, it's good to be back. >> Exactly. And Hibbo, this is the only time I'm going to say it tonight, but a lovely little lucky Green Arrow. Evening, mate. [laughter] >> Good to be back on. Obviously, it's good to have been a Green Arrow as well. I think it's four and about for me. So, >> the Monty slat feels a bit strange, but we we have a quick turnaround ahead of double game of 26. It's the first double of the season. So, look, as they talk about, the only thing we like more than doubles is chips. And I think we have a big decision ahead of tomorrow night as to whether we use one of these second half chips or not. But no, feeling excited. Happy to be kind of rallying a we bit in terms of overall rank and yeah, I think in points I'll talk about me luck a wee bit. >> Oh yes, we will. Yes, we will. We've got some points to talk about tonight. We've also got our normal XGI and C bit tables. We're going to have a big discussion about whether you should be captaining the best asset at Arsenal, which is Gabrielle. So, we're going to be looking at captaining and triple captaining, whether that is a good decision this week because obviously they've got their double gameweek against Brenford and Wolves, both away from home. We've got our predictions this week and the predictions for the double game week, too. We've got goal predictions. We've got fixtures uh based on attack and defense. We've also got the community teams. Somebody is not bottom anymore. And then we've also got our bus teams and Q&A as well. So before we get on to the really juicy stuff when we're starting to look at the double game weeks, let's have a look at the game week that has just passed. So this week, Nacho, I couldn't let you have all the sexy fun last week. So this week I made sure I got 69. Giggity giggity. Uh I had [laughter] I had Ryer in goal with seven and Gabrielle was six. Muki and Anderson both got one. Anderson was on for a little like a mini hall at one point and then conceded two to Everton in the last 20 minutes. Anderson with four on the Friday night. Rogers, who everybody hated, got 10 points. Now everybody loves him again. Uh Fernandez with 20 as my captain. Enzo with two. Rice with five, who was my transfer in for Saka. Really original move. So I'm gutted that I didn't get more there. But five points from him. Uh Harland with 11, his highest score for about 10 game weeks, I think it is. uh could have had more as well apart from Zashlai taking him out at the end but we won't talk too much about that controversy. Ekatik with two and then I had Dravka with one, Krooppy Jr. with two on my bench, O'Reilly with two and Du who obviously is still injured. 69 points I think it was about 20k green arrow but it's three green arrows in a row and as I always say you can never ever turn down a Green Arrow no matter what size it is. Um so there we are. Yeah, 69 points. Uh, not too bad at all, but Nacho absolutely outclassed me. 79 luck free points. Talk us through your points this week, my man, because some of those defenders, some of those cheap budget defenders coming in clutch for you. >> I tell you what, this is, like I said, this was my favorite game week of the season by far because sometimes when you look at your team and you get really excited going into the week and you just anticipate a decent week regardless. This is one of those where I just literally made my transfers, went off the app, and I was like, I don't want to look at my team for the rest of the week. So, this was a delightful week really. So, I made two transfers. I needed to get triple Arsenal, so I sold Sacka to Rice. And then I just had this sometimes I surprised myself sometimes with the the kind of like amazement of my decisions. I ended up selling um let me remind myself who I sold a minute because like I said, I'm just bamboozled. Dorgu to Hill a 3.9 hero who delivered seven points. Now like I said I spoke about this on many many many um podcasts not this one in particular about his passing ability and his assist potential and obviously he picked up that incredible assist for that goal for Paul Mur. So I just [laughter] >> I'm just bringing up I'm just bringing up the chat from from from the the Friday but carry on carry on. >> [laughter] >> So yeah, managed to pick up the seven points from Hill, which was an absolute joy. Seven for Rehea alongside Gabrielle for six, Richards with the eight-pointer. I was clinging on in those last six minutes of extra time, hoping he'd stick on for that. Anderson with the one-pointer. Midfield, Bruno Fernandez with the captaincy. Obviously, we all went there this game week, so it wasn't anything really beneficial. Rogers with the 10-pointer, which was massive in comparison to Embuo obviously delivering who was the other popular pick. Enzo with the two, Rice, my new man with five, and Harland and Echk up top. 442 delivering. >> So, just brought up the chat from Friday night. >> Oh, no. [laughter] >> Uh, Nacho, lads, I'm sick and not prepared. Uh, what what moves which moves do I make? Please, please, please help me. You're the only reason I'm as high as I am. Uh, and then [laughter] do I go do I go Timber and Ambumo? Do I go Chalibur and Rice? So, no mention of Hill. Uh, eventually it got to the point where I said, \"Why don't you go Sessi?\" And then you went, \"Oh, do you know what? I could go Hill.\" I honestly we basically we need to separate out those hill points and give them to me and Hibbo as well because [laughter] that is disgusting behavior. Disgusted behavior. But talking about Lucky, look at this. 75 points from Hibbo and an absolute hall from a player that's only played 150 minutes in his last three games. Talk us through it, Hibbo. [laughter] >> I prepared all this. Don't you worry. >> You are so so salty about this. Anyway, [laughter] um 75 points all out and one free transfer. So, I had the very unoriginal unforced sag race and this was like a green arrow up to 272k. So progress has been pretty good. So from back to front, Ryan Gabriel got 13 combined. Then we had Anderson Alder with one each. Virgil has zero. Then a midfield to say hindsight's 2020. Well, Bruno captain and Palmer are definitely 2020 as well. So we got a goal and clean sheeting bonus for the United man. And then cold Palmer went and got himself a nice early hat-tick and a rest ahead of leads United in midweek. So race week five because he had the defcon end. away two and then up top everybody thought a lot about captaincy and then H went out and got a goal assistant 11 points and Krippy got two. So [snorts] I think last week when we talked about teams I think it was pretty clear that I felt overall my team feels a we bit stretched and that the balance of the game week really depended on how Palmer was going to do because he was a big differential. Now I don't really think I went on this game week thinking he was going to get 20 points. Any player kind of getting the hat tricks lucky you know by and large like a player getting two penalties is kind of lucky but it came [snorts] up trumps for me I'm absolutely delighted because there's no kind of real better feeling I think in the game than a differential hatrick because you'll get a hat trick sometimes it'll be hand but everybody has it do you know whereas this kind of felt a we bit special like so I know you were you were begging me up and like you were you were happy for me um >> you were >> I was I was chuffed said that multiple times, >> but I'm like not one of these kind of unsufferable Palmer guys. Like, you know, I think there was a few that were kind of unsufferable, but um it was nice they had it. They did kind of carry the team this week, but then I'm looking kind of going forward. I was really happy that he came off early because my biggest fear with Palmer was this Tuesday tournament and we talked about it last week. Whereas now I do think he starts I think he plays about 70 against leads then he maybe skips hall in the FA Cup and then I think he starts against Burnley as well after which point they'll come off. So it's been it's been [snorts] lucky in the sense that his mans have been hugely unpredictable and I might have gone on and out of Palmer for four starts which would be quite an achievement given like what we've seen him this season. So um happy enough. He's still so risky though, isn't he? In terms of like I I get obviously the people that owned him and they've done so well this this week. And I think this is is that his third first half hattick. So we know he can do it in limited minutes. And he came out and said some very good things about Renior saying how they all feel much freer. They can attack. They can play the way they want to play. And he did also say though that he is still not fit yet. you know, he's saying once I am fully fit, I'm going to do bits moving forward. Nacho, obviously, Hibbo's in a position where he already owns him, so he's not going to be selling him now. Is he still a risky buy, though? So, I actually don't think he's a risky buy now. Um, I think we all know there's still something going on with him, but we had the rumors about needing possibly surgery. I don't think that will be the case anymore based on what Palmer is saying and and kind of the way that he performed in the last few weeks. I think the minutes have been okay. So just to remind people it's been 60 90 didn't play against Palace and it was 90 74 90. So we've seen decent enough minutes from him but obviously that was the first real game week where we saw any sort of value in Cole Palmer. The problem is really I don't think it's a risk in buying him. I think he does play the leads game and then the Burnley game which are unbelievable fixtures but it's just how you really get to him because nobody's going to move away from their Man United pair Bruno Fernandez or Bumo. Nobody's moving away from that Arsenal. So I think it's a very difficult player to buy because it will require multiple transfers and probably a bit of sacrifice in other areas like a forward line. And because of that I'm quite envious of those that own Palmer like Hibbo because I think you're in a position where not many people can actually get to him that well going into this double game week. And I wouldn't be surprised if he delivers again in these two games. Not to the extent of a hat-tick but some sort of attack and return. and a 13% owned is kind of the big difference between Palmer and Saka where Saka is, I think, a better footballer in terms of consistency, but Palmer just has that first half hattick that not many other players in the Premier League can really produce. >> Yeah, I mean, you should be envious of Hibbo because Palmer's 20 points helped him only lose to you by four points this week. Uh, let's have a look at XDI [laughter] this week. That's I won't do anymore now, Hibbo. Well done, mate. Honestly, I want I genuinely want sheet. He got a clean sheet out of Richards. Palace haven't won a game in two months. [laughter] >> That's a fact. >> You see these things. You see these things. >> Exactly. Let's have a look at the XGI tables uh from the last six game weeks because Thiago is still top. The only person above five XGI for the last six gameweeks. The only two players that are above four are Enzo Fernandez and Harland. Harland is now in third. So he was kind of comfortably in eighth, ninth, 10th position for quite a while, but he's jumped all the way up to third from the last six game weeks. Palmer in fourth. Nacho just talked about the merits of potentially signing him. Bruno Fernandez is in fifth. Bruno Gimme is in sixth. So many new players now. I feel like there must have been something seven game weeks ago that was big for XGI and they've kind of dropped off now. Um Yensen is in eighth. Then Eatique, Ral Gimenez, Casemiro in 11th, Ever Nielson, Cesco, Calbertt, Leuen, and Seamons. Now, the thing I find really interesting here, Hibbo, and it probably goes to show why people have only really invested in their defensive assets. No Arsenal players in the top 15 here. They got a double gameweek coming up against Wolves and Brenford. And Wolves in particular are kind of they've got better defensive data than people think, but they are there for the taking. And obviously we saw that with with Chelsea. No Arsenal assets in before a double game week when they are top of the league. It's interesting, isn't it? >> It is interesting, but I think it's just kind of symptomatic of what we've seen from Arsenal this year. Like, you know, they've obviously been very tight defensively >> going forward. They haven't really been blowing teams away. Like if we look at Arsenal's team, I think in terms of attack, I think historically we always kind of think of Saka as being they're a Palmer, they're a solid, they're kind of main man that can go and change the game. Now it hasn't been the case this year. He's also got injured, but his level I think overall had kind of dropped regardless of that. So I think what we're seeing with Arsenal and with our Arsenal attackers, we're seeing like a big kind of spread in terms of attack and a lot of other attackers don't have great minutes like Mawick. He's come on to the team and I know people had in the fantasy space kind of talked him up potentially as an asset. He's not nailed even when Saka is not in a team like he like he should start but he's not going to play 90 minutes. I don't know if he's ever played 90 minutes personal. you're in this position where they can change Yakarez for Jesus, you know, like they can interchange their wingers away, but Rice is the person that plays all the time and I think that's why we own Rice. So, I think the decision for most fantasy managers was do you triple a defense or do you go double defense and Rice. Now, the argument against Rice all season was the fact that his his underlying numbers weren't really that impressive, but he was obviously kind of tapping along getting defcon, getting the o assist and producing kind of big score. So he's probably hovered slightly below this table for most of the season without ever really kind of truly hitting the big number. And I just think that's where Arsenal are really at. But I think just to go back to the double game, I think either way is a good way to play. Do you know going all in on the defense feels very very all in going all going in on Gabrielle Tumper Rice or Gabriel Ryan Rice feels like he could run on the on the set piece. So I think that race owners will be basically depending on Gabriel popping up way ahead because Rice will probably be the one assistant as well. But I think it's just kind of symptomatic of what we've seen from Arsenal this year. >> It really is and I mean I there's so many players I can mention but most people want to be talking about Arsenal assets this week and the on the C bit table. Chalaba's top with with James Hill 100% for Defcon over the last six game weeks. Yeah, your boy. Uh it's always Bournemouth boys that are our boys. uh strike Marillo uh above 80% Tadibbo Canva uh Dunk Humphre Maveranos there's there's no Arsenal players again in this one but Nacho Gabrielle I mean he does hit defcon more more often than anybody else in Arsenal everybody's obviously looking at Gabrielle we're not going to talk about triple captaincy yet until literally a couple of minutes time when I bring the screen up >> if you weren't going Gabrielle which other defender would you be going for for Arsenal What do you think? >> Well, for captaincy, sorry. Or for selection. >> No, just selection. >> Yeah. So, I was having a look at the Arsenal defenders in general really because I think there is definitely for those that want us to go for double Arsenal defense or triple. I'm also going to put I know we got the C bit table, but also I think it's worth a mention for someone like a David Ryer as well. If you are looking to invest in generic kind of defensive ownership, I think Rey is the really easy pick for just guaranteed minutes over that period and he's really easy to stash away in blank gameweek 31 which is ideal. But when it comes down to actual defenders, I would look at Celiba because I'm seeing some people say I can't really justify paying the big premium. So Celiba could be an option. When I look at his numbers, no goal involvements, 0.05 xG per 90. He's only hit defcon twice. It's just not an option really. Maybe he does hit the jackpot in this double, but I don't really think he's a player that is is fantastic. I think you have to go for Timber outside of that and that would be the one alongside Gabrielle. I would not be surprised at all if Timber was to play both and also outscore Gabrielle because even in that game against Sunderland, there was a moment where a shot come across for the keeper and Timber was stood on the six yard box in open play ready to tap it in if it came to him. So, he's picking up some great spots and I think if you were investing in another defender outside of Gabrielle, I think it has to be Timber and you kind of roll the dice that Ben White doesn't eat some minutes away from him. >> Yeah, I'd love for Kala Fury to be an option. I obviously like he played he played at the weekend and I just love him to be able to play both. Playing both I think is such a tough ass for him, especially with the game in between them as well. But I Yeah, I' I'd love for him to be an option as well. But Hibbo, me and uh me and Az had a a bit bit of a debate about the merits of going Timber over Riyot or going Riyot over Timber. There are going to be people out there with two or three transfers or they don't have their three Arsenal yet. They might have Gabrielle and Rice for instance. Have you got a preference over Ryer and Timber for the double? Rya 100% nailed to play both. Timber. Obviously, Nacho always mentions the white presence uh that is there behind Timber. Which one would you be going for if you had the choice between the two? >> I think playing the ceiling would have to be tumb like you know I've owned Rya for like large parts of the season and it's kind of very normal to kind of get like six points, seven points, two points from Rya. You never really see the big score, but what the big score obviously comes the rusk that could there be rotation. But what you could say I think about this Arsenal double is there's a bit of a gap >> you know the games there's a bit there's a bit of a gap between the games so I I don't think they need to rotate that kind of heavily and like if you're looking I think at tumb xg over the season he's like 5.5 like at arsenal the only people better are like saka yakarez rice and trousard so he's well clear the other defenders like Gabriel for example he's got 2.62 6'2. So he's got more than twice has XG. So when we think about how good Gabriel is in his attacking option, well, I think you have to be thinking Tumbers's much better. As long as the minutes are there, my trio would probably be the two defenders and Rice. I think here because like you're looking at these fixtures, Brenford at home are a good side. You would expect Arsenal to one, but Brenford do okay at home. I think the Wolves game, Arsenal have an opportunity. I think they really smash them like they've been pathetic. I think Chelsea just ran rings around them at the weekend like so I think this Arsenal team could really kind of put them to the sword like eight points this season. It's I think they're very much there for the ticket. But I think it would be Tumbreel race I think for me. >> But that's not how FPL works, is it Hibbo? [laughter] We all think that's what's going to happen and it doesn't always happen like that. But you just mentioned Gabrielle there. Obviously we're talking about defenders there a little bit, but Gabrielle we're saying is, you know, is obviously the first choice what you're expecting. But what people are starting to talk about and obviously we were talking about it last week as well was do you put your captaincy on Gabrielle this week considering you're going to want to put it on an Arsenal player considering the fact they've got Brenford and Wolves away but do you put it on him [snorts] as a triple captain for this week? That is the biggest question because and shout out to FPL Scoop because this is one of the best articles I've read on on Scout for quite a while and there was so many great little bits of data in here as well. Now, what I'm going to do, I'm going to read out what these bits of data are and what they say about it. And we're going to have a pretty big discussion about whether we should be triple captaining Gabrielle because there's quite a few pros and actually there's more um positives about doing it than I thought there were. But there are still some cons as well. So, there's some negatives that we'll talk about, too. But to start with, the table we've got up on here, this is based on players that have had to have started at least 10 games so far this season. and it shows the players that have scored the most average points. So the the most average points per start. Harland is top was 7.5. So he's averaging 7.5 points per start. In second place is Gabrielle. So Gabrielle is averaging 7.4 points per start and he's in second place. Significantly below him, a whole point below him is Bruno Fernandez at 6.4. Then we got Churkey Ekit, but obviously they're they're all getting lower and lower. So Gabrielle straight away when you're thinking right, how many points am I really expecting him from this double game week? If he hits his average, he's getting you 15 points, which obviously tripled is going to be 45 points. That's not too shabby at all. Strikers have to do a lot to obviously get to that same point as well. On the right hand side, it shows what Gabrielle's combined score would have been if you had put the two weeks together at any point in the season. So gameweek one and two, if that was a double gameweek, what would he have scored? Game week two and three, what would he have scored? And as you go down, there is an eight, there is a nine, there is a nine. There is also a 22, a 21, a 21, a 21, a 16, a 24, a 15, a 14, a 14. He's actually lowkey killed it most weeks. And this was starting to make me think this isn't that bad an option. If he score, you know, obviously it's all based on what he scores. I think most people are terrified of him getting two and a two. Most people are terrified of him getting four points tripled to 12 points and it doesn't sound that great. But natur, if we can stick with the positives to start with, these these don't look that bad, do they? I mean, I hadn't seen this until obviously pre-stream where we had a quick look at it and it does kind of solidify the at least the consideration of going for Gabrielle as a pick. I mean, we all know obviously defensive contributions are a big factor this season and if you add two points to any defender alongside being one of the best teams in Europe defensively, then that's a great thing. I think the big question we need to ask ourselves is does a huge part of it defensive contributions even come into the equation with the two games that they do have against Brenford and Wolves. Not so sure against Wolves. I think there is a chance against Brenford just because they do find ways of hitting teams in different ways on the counter whether it be obviously long throws things like that. So I think the Brenford game could actually root the returns for Gabrielle whereas I wouldn't be surprised if the Wolves game almost is one of those where you kind of need the clean sheet attack and return as opposed to defensive contributions. But the great thing about Gabrielle is he's an all action defender and we've known that since day one whereas some defenders like a Celiba is just there really for the clean sheet. Gabrielle kind of can do everything. Like we said, score from a set piece, defcon, great on bonus points. Just for context, I think Gabrielle is like way ahead of Celibra and Timber for for bonus points uh and all defenders really. So for me, I think there is absolutely an argument to not triple captain, but I think with the uncertainty of what the doubles are going to look like later on in the season and not really knowing how big they're going to be, the defense feels a really safe play. And we all know the triple captain isn't the most powerful chip to use. So I feel like this right here is good clarification that if you want to go for triple captain Gabrielle, I think it's absolutely a good play. >> Yeah, I mean Hibbo, we're we're sticking with the positives just for now because obviously we want to go on to the negatives of doing it this week. Even if it wasn't triple captain, he is coming across as the best captaincy option at least this gameweek, isn't he? I think by far and we talked about this last week and like I actually sent you a text message tonight. I said you should start listening to me first time round rather than arguing against me for a week. But we've got there do you know like we have got there and I think when we're looking at say the 115 data Arsenal are obviously fancy to win both games. They're fancy strongly for clean sheets. So like the double clean hasn't done unreasonable and that's really where the kind of big score is. like you've obviously touched upon like worst case scenario was two points two points but you know he has multiple avenues to points because we're looking at three goals over the season two assists I think he's had defcon six times and he's just so consistent and the fact that he's had I think eight points or more on at least 10 occasions which is just really really good so there we want to keep it positive like without really I kind of deal and under the reasons why you wouldn't necessarily do it, but he feels like going into this week a really floor play in a week where there isn't really any Arsenal attackers that people have the means they owning like you know like I think Yakress has a lot of transfers on the head of this game week >> but like from a team perspective how can you buy Yakris like none of us people can can get the Yakress do you know what I mean and if he got him would you c them or would you drop them or you go Gabrielle I think I still think Gabrielle's clear given what we know I think the clean sheet prospects are 56% against Wolves and I think they're around 40% against Brenford. So I think when you factor those in agreement against Wolves you wouldn't really expect much death going out of it >> but you couldn't really bank against Gabriel popping up be a goal in these fixtures like you know it could definitely happen. >> Yeah I think for me I think for me he's like a lock c and we're going to see him he's going to be well over 100%. >> Yeah I've just brought those uh those predictions up as well. So yeah, 41% chance for clean sheet against Brenford, 56% chance for clean sheet against Wolves. Obviously when you put those two together, that means you got 97% chance for clean sheets. That's pretty good. Um, obviously I'm joking. That's not how statistics work. Uh but when we look at the cons for doing it, so the negatives, Nacho, you were mentioning just now, we don't necessarily know exactly how these doubles are going to unfold later on in the season, but in gameweek 33, we've got a big double game week. [snorts] That most likely, if people are wild card, in 32 would be the bench boost week. you would have thought, especially with more teams doubling. But in 36 [clears throat] there is a small double game week including City and City have a very nice double gameweek. I think it's is it Palace and Brenford at home? I think it is. Now that could be a banging triple captain choice, couldn't it? >> 100%. I mean, if you said to me right now, Harland, with two home games against Brenford in Palace or Gabrielle away against Brenford and Wolves, I'd always favor the guy who's the penalty taker, one of the best goal scorers in the league 100%. And I think the gameweek 36, just for context, is the real comparison here because like you said, gameweek 33 being a big double gameweek, I really think a lot of people are going to be leaning towards the bench boost. and if not maybe even the free hit as opposed to the triple captaincy because even if Man City were to get a double in game week 33 the predictions is going to be one of those being against um Arsenal I believe. So it's not like it's a great double game week at all. So it's very much Harland 36 versus an Arsenal player in this particular game week and >> I think the fixtures are better for Harland 36. Now do we know if it's absolutely going to land in that gameweek? We go off the predictors who are very good at what they do, but we don't know it for certain. We also don't know whether Harland and all are going to be available for selection over that period. We don't know whether they're going to be out of the Premier League and competing for the Champions League. And again, it comes down to how much you value the chip. I personally don't value it highly when I compare it to the things like free hit, wild card, etc. So, I think I'm happy to get out of the way for this particular gameweek. But look, if you do hold on to it, I think there is going to be plenty of opportunities in the last few game weeks to use it and you're going to get a double at some point because theoretically we have to and even if it was the worst one at some point, it's still a good time on Erling Harland in any game. So I don't mind people holding it if they want to. >> Yeah, Hibbo is Nacho right there in terms of by gameweek 36 the league could be done. In gameweek 33, Arsenal and Man City play against each other. If Arsenal win that game, which is still a big ass because obviously it's at City, but if they win that game, most likely the season's done by gameweek 36, it could be completely done. City could be further in the Champions League and think, do you know what? We're going to rest Harland. We're going to play Marmush. People were hoping for a double game week. Two lovely fixtures for Harland. Obviously, he can still do it in in one game, but on paper, looking at it now with the uncertainties later on compared to the more certainties we've got now, what do you think is the better play? Triple captain on Gabrielle now or triple captain on Hana later or do you think there's another triple captain? You there's single game weeks, there's there's United whatever to play Burnley, there's Liverpool to play Burnley, any of those. >> I wouldn't play it in a single game week when we have basically the option to play it in a double. And I do think we're going around this the right way. We're going through it nearly like a process of elimination looking at the options to see like as there a better chance later on. Now what you're saying is correct. There's obviously fixture predictors that look at the scheduling down the line and basically say like where could this fixture potentially go and one of the conversations around Man City is that they could have a double game week 36. Now from scout chat scout said that there's still the potential that that Man City game could stay in 31. Uh yeah it's it's based on whether they both get knocked out of Europe. >> Ah so that's like you know there there's slight permutations here. The other factor is >> I think Man City have sulfured in the next round of the cup but then in the quarterfinals which is also called the fifth round. We don't know who they're potentially going to draw. So like Man City could draw a team which basically puts them out before the semi-finals and then if that happens you would imagine that that Crystal Palace fixture will then just go on to 33 dino and create an earlier double which means they won't double in 36. So there's more permutations I think than just will those players be playing at that point in time and that's like another really big ask because I think if we get to the stage where it is kind of game week 36 the league is effectively gone say for example like man the kind of quarterfinal semi-finals of the Champions League at that stage they're going to be thinking well seconds locked up like we can't really drop worse than that with guaranteed Champions League football for next season we're in the semi-finals for example a champions league at this point in time we have to focus on that so like as there the potential that they say to H we're going to rest you marmush is going to start like if we look only quite recently that's happened to H do you know where Pep has basically said he's absolutely shattered he's talking him out of the firing line now Han doesn't need that very often his minutes are strong and like his minutes are very very consistent but there is always the potential that they basically say Look, this is a quite an easy double game week. Our schedule's far too compacted. He's going to ride the bench for one of these fixtures. So, I think it's like a bird in the hands worth two in the bush. Like, is it really is it really worth gambling that a better opportunity becomes available when you can just have this Gabrielle fixture now? Like, you know, it's like for me, I think like the analysis that was done by this guy that's written for Scout, the FPL scoop, I thought it was really good. I really like these when you combine the fixture scores. You know, it's a very simplistic way to look at it, but it just shows these in terms of scope, there's a potential of hitting a big scoring Gabrielle anyway. And maybe we have to reset our mindset a we bit because traditionally we look at this chap and we think we need a big hating forward, but like we've done it in the past, we've done it in Shane Duffy. So, >> yeah, that's [laughter] true. I mean, and you look as well at at his average, you know, we we like we've just said, his average points are 7.4. four. If if he gets that and he gets you 15, I think you're laughing really. I think I think you're walking away quite happy. I mean, Nacho on that, what's a failure? So, if you looked at at Gabrielle and you looked at his points this week, so if you had to say now he's hit these points, I think that's a failure with a triple captainship. What would it be? >> Oh, wow. Well, this is the thing with the defense defender, isn't it? Is that like defenders in particular are so influenced by the rest of the team. he could have a great game, but if somebody has a howler and they concede late on, then you know that's the big issue you got with defenders. Whereas if you go for the goal scorers, don't really matter how the whole team plays. As long as he has a penalty or he does his business, then usually to walk away with with some points. So for me with Gabrielle, honestly, like there is a world where we walk away with backto-back two-pointers and he doesn't hit defcon. So that that is we have to consider that. Well, you have to. Um, so yeah, of course >> you're so high right now. [laughter] You have to >> We have to. It's like Ross from Friends. >> Yeah, >> I'm fine. >> I'm fine. So yeah, I I'm I'm preparing myself for a four-pointer. >> Yeah. Brilliant. >> That but you know, >> we got lots of people just joining us from uh from the Blackbox stream and they've just tuned into you going, I'm predicting a four-pointer. [laughter] >> Yeah. Um, before we move off Gabrielle though, Hibbo, why is nobody talking about Rice as triple captain or or even just captain? Because everybody's jumping straight on Gabrielle. Rice obviously there he's he's done it this year in certain weeks or over Christmas he absolutely smashed one of the game weeks, didn't he? But is the fact that I could only say that once. Is that the reason why nobody's even considering him? I think just the underlines aren't really there. Like I think you know really like this table as you say from FPL scoop is showing like how Gabrielle can keep piss with the best player in the game really can't do you know whereas we we can't say that about race. So like I think he's very reliant on set pieces. He's not really doing much from open play. He's not going to get the clean sheet like he's only going to get one point for that. could get defcon but I think Gabrielle is a player that you have to go for like if you're going to just go for flat captainy and then in terms of a triple I agree there is the risk that we walk away here be like two points two points and that's an epic fail and later on the season people get hand for a plum double game but [sighs] it's just risk reward and the fact that if you go now like you're hoping that you hit the bike score and then the hand thing doesn't really materialize for everybody you know through one avenue or another it suddenly becomes a bad option of the double game week doesn't happen or he gets rested for one of the games. So, I think given that we're all kind of chasing rank a we bit, I think at this point in time, it kind of makes sense for me anyway to just double down and go for Gabriel Allen. >> Yeah, I mean >> hope for the best. Nacho, I'm going to go on to the predictions in a minute, but we've got to have one more thing I want to ask about Arsenal, and that is if you've already got, say, Gabrielle and Rice, and you wanted something spicy, something you thought, you know what, nobody else is going to own this Arsenal asset, and I want to really show off to my mini league mates, who would be your differential, your differential Arsenal pick? >> My Wii differential. Who would >> Who would be your Who would be your Wii differential? For me it would be Havitz. >> It would be Havitz because I personally think Arsenal with Havitz are a completely different beast. I think he is kind of the best of all of the forwards that they have available to them. And also we saw Havitz play in that midfield three. I believe it was against Sunderland as well. So we've got variety in where Havitz can play in that team. Now again the problem is he is a forward and he's 7.3 million. Is there any world where I am more confident over Havvertz in 26 and 27 than that of like a Xiao Pedro? Probably not. But if you are looking for a punt, I probably would lean towards Kai Havitz myself. I can't justify paying 8.7 million for Yokarez myself when the last time he played 90 minutes was gameweek nine. >> My god, I like that one. Uh Hibbo, go on. Give us what? You cannot say habits now. Give us another Arsenal we differential. I don't really think there is any kind of punch slick, but I'll I'll give you one just for the sake of giving you one. Yress, >> we'll see Yagris. >> Oh, do you know I I said >> I heard somewhere that he hasn't played 90 since gameweek nine. >> That guy sounds very smart. >> Tell me about it. >> Who said that? >> Honestly, who said that? >> Nacho. Was Nacho doing kind of some kind of content that I haven't seen? Is this >> He's bloody. >> He said it. You said it 30 seconds ago. >> Sorry, I'm not feeling well, boys. [laughter] >> Got to hit it. >> My god. My god. Right, let's >> slag off hippo and he won't hear. >> This is what people tune in for. Right, let's have a [laughter] look at let's Oh, I can't believe it. Right, let's have a look at some uh predictions for this week then because uh Arsenal are obviously in all of our thoughts, but they are not the team that is most expected to win this week. Chelsea have got a 62% chance of beating Leads. Crystal Palace a 66% chance of beating Burnley. And then we've also got Man City. We're playing Fulham. 68% chance for win there. But of course Arsenal's second game against Wolves, they do have a 70% chance for win. So a big one there. But we've talked about Arsenal enough. And Nacho, I was going to ask you because you own a Crystal Palace defender. They are up against Burnley next. And then they've got I can't remember who it is now because they've got two lovely fixtures, haven't they? Oh, and then we got Wolves at home. >> Wolves. Yeah. >> Nowful, >> we've all got to think about the fact that they will most likely blank in gameweek 31, but they do have some cheap options in Richards. They got some medium options in Laqua who hauled this week. I think it was 11 pointer from him. They've also got some absolutely explosive options in players like Munos. Do you think the upside with the next two fixtures counteracts the fact that they're not going to play in gameweek 31 or most likely not going to if you wanted to invest this week? So I think also a big thing that managers need to remember regarding Crystal Palace is of course the Conference League first and second leg playoff because this is something that I was actually completely forgetting about and I was looking at Munos and Sar both as considerations like you said with the blank game wicket 31 also having to be in the back of our mind but when you look at the fixtures coming up for them Burnley Wolves United Spurs and I believe it's leads before the blanket 31 but just for context X obviously the gap between the Burnley game and their first leg is like 8 days. So you don't have to worry about that kind of turnover. But the Wolves game is going to be wedged between the first leg on the 19th. Wolves are then three days later and then four days after that they've got the second leg of their playoff and then I believe it's like three days after that or four they've got Man United. So the gap between Burnley and the first leg, don't worry about the Burnley game, but that Wolves game, we might just see a [snorts] slightly fatigued Palace team possibly if they're not able to use their full squad, if they are obviously trailing or they have a draw going into the second leg. But look, as good as fixtures come, they're coming up against the two worst teams in the league. And I think if you're in a position right now where you don't have a Richards and you investing just in one Palace defender and you have a way of getting Munos, I think that would be an unbelievable differential. And don't be scared to own him for the next five and then sell him in game week 31 because then after that I think there isn't as much value in Palace. >> Yeah. I mean, so I've been looking at because I've got Duo still, I've got O'Reilly still, I've got all these players I'm just looking at and thinking, my god, how have how has my defense got this bad? And I know Hibbo's in the same kind of position with like say Collins. Van Dijk's obviously messed you up a bit and I'm looking at it and thinking and Hibbo I was going to ask you about this in particular because Brenford don't have a nice fixture this week but after this week their fixtures are lovely and Thiago he's he's gone down this week in price. He's 7 million again now but I feel like he's going to be that next player where everybody tries to jump on. Now, how important is it to keep that money to either I mean, you don't need to keep money if you're going to move ech down, but I don't think many would suggest that. How important is it to be able to get Thiago in? So, if you're looking at Palace, you know what? Is there a big difference between going Riches and Moon if it stops you for instance getting Thiago in next week? How important do you think getting Thiago is? I think it's a massive difference and I think like you make a good point like obviously Brenford this week to have Arsenal but then you're looking 27 onwards like Brighton who look in bad shape I think Brighton Burnley Bournemouth Wolves and leads in 31 and that's kind of a bit of the kind of crunch next year because we're all effectively going to be playing under 31 is like a dead end and I think what you're going to see is people trying to get at least three Bford players on their team as well. So I think for me Thiago somebody that I'm looking to target I have 2.5 million in the bank and like my path is basically get crippy in or [snorts] they move crippy sorry Thago >> now as you say if I like I've got a few problems and we'll look at it in boss teams I have a few problems saying midfield and defense where so many of my issues could be fixed if I say move tav like sir because then I could bench one of my defenders now you could look on the short term and think those fixtures are good palace at Burnley they've got wolves they've leads they are going to blink at 31. I think Nacho made some really good points or in the kind of conference league which I hadn't really fully considered myself as well. I would expect these players still to play but we've seen historically we Crystal Palace players and fatigue in these competitions that SAR's broken down already this season because of that. So it would put me off because I think you're going to get to a point kind of closer where you're thinking now I have to sell these people and I'm potentially not going to be able to make that kind of 27 move and they and Thiago and like kind of just the touch on Brighton I think like I looked at Brighton against Crystal Pal the full game on Sunday and I felt like at times their team was kind of unrecognizable you know they had these kind of random players on the bench and or random players starting and then good players coming off the bench And then at the end of the game there was lots of kind of chance for the fans to see sack the manager and all doesn't seem right there. And I think it's it's [laughter] you're maybe seeing a scenario where Brighton are probably going to become a kind of team to target especially in terms of home fixtures for like say like Brenford. I think Brighton at home is a very good fixture. Now >> Brighton are a weird one for me. Brighton are always a team where when you expect them to win they don't. [snorts] And when they go up against teams that you think oh they're going to struggle here they do well. Like they they just always do it. This week I thought here we go Brighton home to Palace. Palace are kind of really struggling. One nil win to Palace and you just think well just can't predict Brighton half the time. But a player that's historically we've been able to predict Nacho but recently we haven't until now and apparently he's back in form now because he scored a penalty is Harland. What are the chances that all we've been doing is talk about Arsenal double gameweek. We're pinning all our hopes on a central defender in two away games when Harland is playing against Fulham. And we've seen this so often where Fulham just they just let City do whatever they want whenever they play against each other. They did it earlier on in the season where everybody went against Harland for captaincy and he got was it two goals and assists, 17 points against him I think it was. I can't remember exactly what it was. I could be wrong there. What were the chances of Harland just just smashing it again and actually outscoring all the Arsenal players anyway? >> Oh, wouldn't be surprised at all. I mean, just as a bit more of like an outer sort of point like the fact that Harland's being sold by so many people a couple of weeks ago, couple now. I think less going into gameweek 26 now obviously after scoring against Liverpool. But I mean the fixtures coming up for them. Fulham, Newcastle all over the place right now. Forest in 29, West Ham in 30. I mean, if anyone's selling him, I think it's a very brave move. But to your point in gameweek 26 in isolation against Fulham. I mean, absolutely he could do better. Is there any world where it makes sense to captain him over an Arsenal player? No. I would have Harland below even Declan Rice, for example, because of his double game week. But I mean, it's a differential pick, weirdly enough, this week. But no, I would still back the double game weaker. But again, for those that are selling Harland, I would be very very cautious because just one of those players that there's no way he's going to continue not scoring frequently. And I think we are going to see with this fixture run coming up, a bit of a return to form for him. >> It's still over 100%. Do you think? >> I think it'll be close, [snorts] won't it? I I I think it will. It was 113 at my rank and obviously that is very high rank um this week just gone. So I probably would say [laughter] I would probably say it's going to be 100 bob on. >> Do you I mean 100 bob on you got to go against him, haven't you? Because I think you know you're not having to worry about him too much. But I I mean not that EO should affect that but yeah interesting. Um right let's have a look at uh fixtures very very quickly. I'll go through these. In terms of attack, the top team is Liverpool. Even with the Arsenal double gameweek, it is Liverpool that are top. Uh then we've got Arsenal in second with the double gameweek of course, then City, then Chelsea, then Bournemouth uh who are in fifth. And then in terms of defense, it is Arsenal that are clear at the top, followed by Liverpool who I swear we say Liverpool are near the top every week and they never keep clean sheets. Um then we got Man City who also seem to never keep clean sheets and then Chelsea and then Bournemouth who also never seem to keep clean sheets. So interesting there in terms of uh who is in the top five, but Arsenal comfortably top by the way. Interesting that Fulham and Aston Villa are the next two in that table in terms of defense. But >> Nacho, I've been waiting for this all night. Talk us through these community teams because >> the table's had a bit of a shakeup, hasn't it? >> What? >> Well, we had this last week, didn't we? Where we had that [clears throat] glimmer of hope where we got our Green Arrows. There was a bit of, you know, bit bit of complacency from the community teams and I think they've done that once again. They're kind of almost underestimating us, I believe, right now. They're kind of forgetting that we're the big dogs in in this league and big baby. So, the big dogs and like you said, there is a new bottom of the league and that is is a good looking bottom. It's um the OG [laughter] comm team, the fall from grace. The OG com team. Um yeah, just not not going their way right now. 60 points. The 12-pointer of Dalow on the bench is devastating. We love to see it, but it is obviously not nice to see for them. Big return as double Arsenal defense, of course, Bruno Fernandez with the 20 pointer and Harland with the 11. But yeah, it's not been a good month or so for the OG com team. Um top of the table still the newcome team, 66 points for them. They've given me a bit of an update and they said about resisting Andy's burner transfer dare. So, they didn't go down that route in the end, thank God. But they used two of their transfers, bringing in Timber and Imbu, which obviously paid off in particular of Inbu. And they sold, I believe, Saka and Chia of Newcastle, which proved quite well. >> They've mentioned about how they're going to look to dead ending game week 31 effectively. So, we're getting a little bit of intel, boys, about what they are planning to do here. sharing a bit more information wild carding game week 31 and for anybody that's kind of looking at a chip strategy right now I would say that's becoming quite a common trend where managers are using up their transfers or trying to prepare for the blank gameweek wild card in 32 and as we know a bench boosting 33 and that's kind of what route they're going down right now but it is getting very close in the league just for context 1485 total points for first and fifth is 1420 so it very close in this league now. >> I like it. And I've just got this image of the OG com team sat at home listening to Selen Dion because they know that they're not going to have to make us do any forfeits this year. Newcom team though, we're all coming for you. We are We are coming for you. My goodness. Right, let's have a look at some bus teams then. So, this is my bus team. I got 2.5 million in the bank. Only one free transfer. Obviously, I've got quite a bit in the bank from doing the Sacka to Rice move last week. Uh, I haven't done the captains on this, so ignore that. But I've got Ry in goal, Gabrielle will be my captain. It's just whether I want to make him triple captain. Uh, I've currently got Muki and O'Reilly playing at the back as well. Uh, with Rice Anderson Rogers, Bruno Fernandez, who is captain on this, but he won't be. Uh, with Enzo, and then Harland and Ekit up top. I am most likely going to be doing a defensive move this week, but oh, for the life of me, I really like the look of a Palace defender, but I don't think with the fact I've got O'Reilly Harland, triple Arsenal, if I bring in a Palace defender and it's not for O'Reilly, I've already got six at a blanket in 31. And I think I'm just doing myself a worry later on. So I think I'm going to do D good or James Hill potentially because James Hill is good for defcons. I'm not expecting loads of clean sheets in that run. I actually don't think Bournemouth's run is as good as the fixture tickets say. Everton away, West Ham away, Sunderland at home, Brenford at home, Burnley away, Man United at home. I don't I don't think that's that good of a run. Personally, I I don't think I genuinely think they could get to the And that run and have no clean sheets, but you know, James Hill is 3.9 million because >> the big thing I want to be able to do is bring Thiago in the week after. I don't think I want to lose Echertique. I think Ech's fixtures I actually quite like moving forward. Sunderland away, Forest away, West Ham at home, Wolves away. I I think there's goals in all of those. Spurs at home. And yeah, >> you know, Liverpool have looked good in an attacking sense recently. So, I think I want to keep Ekkit. I think I want to do Krooppy up to Thiago. Enzo will probably go the week after because obviously I don't want to keep having to have a decision with eight good attackers. So, I think that's the way I go. I have to do something with my defense. Dora to James Hill probably makes sense and then I've still got Anderson, Muki, you know, I probably then get rid of O'Reilly at some point, too. But all of a sudden these free transfers start getting used up before 31. And I think if I already bring in another Palace defender, I can't I can't get to 31 in a good way. So yeah, I think that's probably what I'll do. Dork to James Hill. I need I think if I do that, I've got a point4 buffer doing Krooppy to Thiago and I think that'll probably see me through until the double game week's finished. So yeah, that's the way I'm looking at the moment. The rest of the team is looking all right for this week though. I think I I think I'm happy with my midfield, happy with the strikers. It's just that defense I need to improve. So, I think I'd play O'Reilly, play James Hill, and play Gabrielle. Uh, Nacho, talk us through your point. Your team looks handy this week. >> Yeah, team looks not too bad at all this week. Um, I've got 2.8 million in the bank, one free transfer. I'll just quickly go through the team and then some thoughts. So, double Arsenal with Rehea and Gabrielle. Gabrielle currently with the triple captaincy and after doing this stream I'm even more certain I'm going to triple captain him and just get out of the way. Richard's at home against Burnley and then O'Reilly at home against Fulham. Again rolling the dice a little bit of O'Reilly starting but I think the versatility that he's shown I think Pep is trusting him once again in this City team. So I think that does favor him. Well I hope anyway. Mfield five of Enzo, Lefi, Rice, Rogers and Fernandez. And while Lefi looks a bit of a problem in this team, I kind of looked at my team in preparation for gameweek 25 and thought that, you know, Lefi at home against Liverpool isn't the worst thing in the world on penalties. Liverpool after what we saw in gameweek 25. I mean, would I be surprised if Sunderland were to actually put up a really good test up against Liverpool? Not at all. I think they're still quite shaky defensively. They don't have a right back going into this game. So, I'm quite actually content with owning Lefy in that fixture. And he does hit defcon as well which is a good bonus. And then we got Harland up front against Fulham and Ekitique away against Sunderland. Hill Anderson of Fulham and Gooey on the bench. And similar to yourself when I'm looking a bit more longer term, I've got the money in the bank to do any defender to Munos. I could do Lefi to Ishmael Sar which is great. But again, when you're actually being a bit of a boring safe player, when I look ahead to gameweek 28, which is going to give me three transfers if I get there, I'm going to have problem players like Enzo, Richard's blanket in the future. I'm going to have Harland, Rice, all these players. And I just think even though there is some real upside and go for Crystal Palace, it's really boring. But I think rolling the transfer makes complete sense. avoiding Palace alto together knowing I'm going to really benefit from these transfers in the future and hopefully we dodge some injuries. >> Yeah, because you've got six already for 31, haven't you? So, if that does become that blank game with Palace as well, you've already got what? O'Reilly, Richards, Gabrielle, Rice, uh Harland, like it's quite a few already, isn't it? >> Yeah, it just the upside absolutely could be there for Palace, but I just don't think I need it, especially with already riches in my team. I've got some sort of cover. >> Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Hibbo, talk us through yours, my man. >> Okie do. So, one and 2.5 million in the bank for me. So, I think we've talked about that already. This that's effectively Miago money. And this week, it looks very likely I'm going to trouble Captain Gabriel. So, from back to front for the podcast, people have got Ryan Go, Gabriel TC at the moment. Um, Virgil and then Collins and Alder two, you know, we links at the back. Then a midfield I've got Palmer, Bruno, Rice, and Enzo. have been off for that up top then Holland and Krippy. So where I use me transfer this week's a good question. I feel like I'm fielding two pretty weak defenders. I've got a weak forward. I've got no real base to speak of. Now how I'm kind of logically coming at this as there's a bit of talk that Marcus Tav'll be back for 27 or 28. So if he's back for then it feels like a waste for me to use a transfer in that position. Do you know? Now I completely agree with what everybody's saying here. Like in terms of my position, I don't have any Crystal Palace, but I have me Arsenal players. I've got H, but then I've also kind of got weak links that aren't really playing like Barnes and stuff like that. So I have to be kind of very mindful of that if I'm going to then add a Crystal Palace player to the mix. So like in one sense I could look at SAR and think look Burnley fixture is good, Wolves fixture is good. It would be very kind of double game or gameweek aggressive over over two successive weeks, but it really impacts and hurts me in a future moves because it stops me from getting Thiago one, but it also doesn't really fix like one of the real issues in me team, which is going to be that come 31, I'm going to have a really lack of transfers to be able to play through correctly because I'm I'm already down effectively about at least you're talking about five players at the moment. Um, which is a bit of a stretch. Now, what I could do with this team is I could do creepy Thiago this week, but then you're looking at it thinking Thiago plays Arsenal at home. I'm really lumping on the Arsenal defense so much that I want to chop a captain. Is there any sense in doing that? I think I might as well play crippy at everything and then get to the week after. So, one other option is just to roll, suck it up, and then reassess. So, that's really going to be my final decision. do a role of transfer or do maybe just make one small defensive change for somebody like Collins or Alder just to kind of push my team through. But I'm leaning towards a role despite the team looking to be but some optimal because then I'm thinking from the week after I can really focus my transfers on right how do I fix this team for 31 like that's that's really going to be my mindset then. >> Collins is I honestly I thought he was just a mainstay but he really is just getting benched at the moment isn't he? He basically dropped out of the team and they were saying because he was hurt so he needed to have he had he had a cutter of gas in his leg and training and he needed to get stitches and it was very close to the game. So they they must have said to him no look you're going to rest >> but then they did well and they kept them out so they kept the clean sheet >> in the game where they went down to 10 men. So they was that against Aston Villa. So they've obviously said, \"No, you're not getting back in because the team kept the clean sheet, which was quite surprising because I think last season he played every medal for Brenford. But he's a bit a problem if he's not going to play.\" But I think it could potentially just take a ditch in this week because I'm looking at Anderson, you're thinking in gameweek 31, he's got Burnley, I think, you know, so you're going to see you're going to see people for that blank blank game week starting to say, \"Right, I'll have a we bit of maybe Roz, I'll have a bit of Harry Wilson. I'll have a bit of Anderson.\" So he's not going to be a player I'm going to sell. So really I'm looking at Messi's way on this team. Ashley Barnes is going to be one. Tab's going to be one. But I think once I get another week's information and once I get these harder fixtures out of the way for like Alder and Collins, maybe by next week Collins is back. You know, maybe Collins plays against Arsenal stays in the team. Alder has better fixtures again. Then I have two FTs. But I think this week it's the same as last week. >> It's all down to Co Palmer. >> God. Let's let's see what he can do with 30 minutes of football this week. Right, let's uh chuck [laughter] out to the chat. Any questions that they've got uh any questions that you've got in the chat, let us know. We will try and answer as many as possible in the next couple of minutes. Adam Stam says, \"What are your thoughts on doing Watkins to Gawkarez as my third Arsenal and triple captain him?\" What do you reckon, Nacho? I just don't like it. I don't like it. You're buying him for a third Arsenal. I get it. But like I said, he has played 19 minutes this game week nine or something. So I would be sorry if he starts one as bench the other. So I don't love it myself. >> Yeah. Uh Ata Boy says, \"Are Wolves assets worth it for a oneweek double gameweek punt? Do I get Mane for instance for Thiago or Echitique?\" Hippo >> Manny for who? Ekatiki or >> Thiago. >> No, but I do think there's a scenario where [clears throat] it maybe makes sense because sorry two seconds Devcon's changed the game a bit. So we think if you've got a player maybe in midfield like say for example my scenario with Tav or my scenario with Ashley Barnes there might be a reason there to go for say like Manny or to go for like somebody like Gomez who's maybe going to come in get four appearance points and one defcon maybe get six points do you know what I mean that could be for somebody quite an effective use of transfers compared to being quite far behind the curve which is something which I consider for my team but again do I really want to be seeing Ashley Barnes for Manny for like one week. >> Yeah, >> I definitely wouldn't say Santiago. No chance. >> Uh, Kalo says, \"Uh, who would you prefer this week, Nacho? Munos versus Burnley or Mane in his double game week?\" >> Munos every day. >> Like it. >> Yeah, Munos. Um, uh, Eranden says, \"Do I start, [laughter] do I start, uh, Calbertt Leuen, Sessi, or Wilson this week, Hibbo?\" >> Calvert Lean, Sessi, or Wilson. >> Yeah, >> we're doing away things. Sessi. Jeez, my eyes are going square looking at this. Sessi [laughter] >> anticipation. Sessi. >> Yeah, >> Sessi. Nice. Uh, Indies in the chat. Hello. Indie says, \"Which moves would you do from the following? Hall to Moon this week and rice to Palmer next week? I'm trying to tap into variance. Other option is Miley to Smeno.\" So, would you do Hall to Moon this week, Nacho, or would you do uh rice? Oh, so you could do uh which moves would you do from the following? But I think he said then rice to Palmer next week. Oh, so would you do Hall to Moon this week, but then it would stop you from doing Rice to Palmer next week. >> It Palmer's now or never in my eyes because you just missed you you'd missed the great fixture this week. You'd be buying him for a great game week 27, but then the fixtures afterwards get quite difficult for Chelsea. So, I think you need to jump on now to really benefit. >> Yeah. Uh like this question by the way. Jakalowski says, \"Why is there no love for free hit 31?\" Hibbo, what am I missing? >> I think because we look at this blank game week and we basically think at the AFL Cup creates a small blank. We also have a wild card. So like if you look at most of our teams, I think we've got like three hours, one man, and then maybe a couple of weak players towards the fringes team. So the general thinking is by the time 31 comes around we should have a transfer from like 27 28 29 30 31 5 FTs should give you the opportunity to play that as a dead end and then wild card under 32 there's going to be potentially better options to free and we've talked about this earlier before we came on stream actually like where looking at the projected double game weeks like I think the fixtures at 34 which clash with the FA Cup semi-finals. The thinking is that they'll go on to 33. >> So if we well cared in 32, they really had the doubles in 33. The chances are most of those players are then going to blink in 34, which means you're going to need that free head for down the line. So that's really a synopsis of what the reasoning is and I just think it's a wasty free hit 31. >> And last one from Finley Craig. >> It does. And last one from Finley Craig saying, \"If you have already used your bench boost or you're not planning on bench boosting in 33, would you still triple captain this week Nacho?\" >> So, so for instance, if you'd already used it and then you can't use it in 36 or 33 or whatever it is, it because you're then more likely to triple captain in 36, I guess, would you be more tempted to save it? Yeah, then I think there is more temptation because you automatically open up one additional game week naturally. Um, but again it comes down to whether you back this Arsenal team. I think I I think it comes down to if you think Arsal keep one clean sheet this double game week then I think you have to consider Gabrielle as a triple captain regardless. But I just don't think we know exactly what the landscape's going to look like for 33 and 36. But if I didn't have a bench boost available, I would be more tempted to hold it for one of the two Harland games. Yes. >> Interesting. Right. Thank you so much for everybody in the chat for your questions. We appreciate appreciate all of them. There's over well, it's just about 400 people in the chat. So, thank you so much for joining us this evening. Remember, it is the deadline tomorrow at 6. >> Pretty sure it's 6. 7:30 is the first one, isn't it? Yeah. Uh, so make sure you lock your teams in. I've got parents evening tomorrow until 7:00. So I'm going to have to and I am chocka block. I'm chocka. [laughter] >> I am chocka block for they literally 10-minute segments or segments sessions from 3:30 till 7. So I've got to lock in before 3:30, which is going to be interesting. Um, but uh yeah, do remember to make sure you lock in. And obviously, if you want to beat your mini league mate and they don't know there's a midweek, don't tell them. Uh, HBO, thank you so much for joining us this evening. I hope you enjoyed yourself, my man. >> I think it's been good. I think it's been nice to kind of talk through this. And it's it's got me in a way thinking that I'll probably very much trouble captain Gabrielle. So my only advice to you is tomorrow at parents evening, don't come out of the toilets at around half sex sweating because it wouldn't be like a particular it wouldn't be a particularly good look. >> Are you are you just trying your best every week to get cancelled? It was I linking that with the Epstein chat last week from my go provide context. >> How can you potentially make changes to your team? Because at a parents evening you would have to basically go to the toilet or something. Do you know what I mean? >> Nacho, let's go to the sensible one. Thank you so much for joining us this evening, my man. I hope you enjoyed it. >> Pleasure as always. Yeah, I think it's um been good value and um yeah, triple captain for the way this week. >> Nice. Thank you so much for everybody that have been listening. Thank you for everybody that listens on the pod after and on the stream after as well. We appreciate all of you. Good luck this week. The next time we see you, we'll be I'm not sure we're going to stream before the second Arsenal game, are we? So, I'm not sure when we're going to stream next, actually. >> Wednesday. >> Tuesday next week, we're going to stream, aren't we? >> Yeah, I think we do Tuesday next week. Yeah. Yeah. Usual next week. >> And that's before Arsenal. >> That's what I was going to say. Yeah. So, we won't know the second, will we? >> We would have had to We would have had a Gabrielle brace by then, so it doesn't matter. >> Yes, we'll be happy. Right. Thank you so much, everybody. We will see you all at some point next week. Uh but fingers crossed for a Gabrielle bullet header and two clean sheets. Love you all. See you then. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello and welcome to another video and podcast from Fantasy Football Scout. My name is Joe and today I'm joined by Mark aka the FPL general to ahead to the next game week which is gameweek 26 and the first double game week of the season. Welcome Mark. How are you? >> I'm well Joe, very well. Had a really enjoyable fantasy weekend. Had a good real life weekend as well. So, feeling good this Monday and looking forward to the first double game week of the season. I've got a got a bench boost active. So, uh all going to plan hopefully hopefully can get a green arrow midweek. >> Great. Yeah. So, we've got lots to pack into this show. So, it's a double game week for uh Arsenal and Wolves. So, we're going to have a look in detail about um those options there with a particular eye on um who might be worth putting the triple captaincy chip on. And as Mark mentioned, he is bench boosting. So, he's set his team up to bench boost. There'll be a few of you out there, but I think most of you will either be um considering the triple captaincy or or not not to use that and the bench boost. So, I think that was something you'd have to plan for. So, we'll have a look at see how Mark set up there as well. As he said, he had a great gameweek score there. So, even though a double Harland double digit score for Harland, who Mark famously this season is going without, um it was an absolutely huge haul there. So, I'm expecting the comment section below to be a little quieter with the the criticism of why Mark hasn't got Harland there. Um, we'll have a look at some midfielders as well. See who the latest good ones are. That's with a view to um Brian Bowmo was seen limping, but I think he should be fine. And also a lot of players I remember Sergio Aguero used to limp after every match anyway and he come back and score a hattick. So, um I wouldn't worry too much about that. And it's good to keep a handle on that especially for those like me um and many others who have the likes of say Enzo Fernandez whose good runner fixtures runs out soon. Um they might want to actually offload some Arsenal midfielders if they have one or two there. Um also we'll have a look at best forwards as well. So just the latest there and as usual we'll check in with the captaincy matrix as well. Who are the best captains? Not just for this week but for the weeks ahead because the deadline this week is a Tuesday. So do remember that. That's why um uh you will see um a lot of frenzy content going ahead ahead of Tuesday. Okay. Well, let's this I mean this is great. Let's let's put your score up then. Um 93 points. Do you want to I mean who do you love? All of them, but um uh do you want to just take us through your team? Who who you happy with? Who you especially happy with and who maybe not so happy with? >> Yeah, it was I thought it was my best week of the season, but I had a look back. It's actually the second best gameweek. So, this was a gameweek rank of 59,000. My favorite number. I did have a 25k gim rank ages ago when I captain Phil Ford Finen, but this was probably my most enjoyable game of the season. I rolled a transfer to start with. Um, so I've got two two freeze available for midweek if needed. Went from 2.2 million to 1.4 million and it could have been even better. It was the late Erling Holland show. I might have even been inside the top 1 million. Uh, which would have been pretty crazy if if Holland didn't have the late goal and assist, but that's what I'm up against every week, of course. But the points were on the board already. Amy Martinez with a six-pointer in a game where he didn't keep a clean sheet was fantastic. He got a late bonus point added as well to go from five to six. Double Arsal defense, Gabriel Timber. H, my attacking defender Daniel Munos with a five-pointer for a clean sheet. Almost had an assist as well for Strand Larson. Mhm. >> So hopefully going forward he's going to get more attacking returns. The midfield five really disappointed last week. It was only Bruno who delivered last week. But fast forward, Brandon Bumo scores. Rice gets his dev corn and clean sheet. Morgan 10pointer and the main man I've had to get his jersey out today. Here he is. Audio listeners. I've got my old Palmer shirt. >> Number 20 on the back. He doesn't even wear number 20 anymore, but he did score. He did score 20 20 points. >> Wow. >> Uh so yeah, Manchester United fan. Don't tell my friends I've got a Cole Palmer Chelsea shirt in order. I get to pull it out sometimes. So yeah, Cole Palmer took the gamble on the wild card. Give me 24. >> Enzo Fernandez was the obvious pick that week. There was obviously some regret last week, but again, you give it a bit of time and the gamble pays off. Couple of penalties, good goal, and massive differential points there. Up front, Thiago scored, but they get a yellow card. And Jared Bowen, it was almost a full house of returns. Bowen was the only player who blanked. And on the bench again could have been another bench boost week. S with two, Meguire six, Hill with seven, and Manny with two. >> And the main thing, great game week, but also no injuries, no suspension. So hopefully be able to roll again and get the bench booster out of the way midweek. >> So we'll have a look in a second about the team that you're going into gameweek 26 with with your bench boosting. But as you said, you could have bench boosted with this. 17 points I would I think is a good score for a bench boost. that would have taken you to 110 points which would which which I think would have taken you possibly into the top million or very close to it certainly there. Um yeah I had a similarly good game week as well. I mean I think I say everyone did but a lot of people had the sort of main assets there. So if you captain Bruno Fernandez even if you captain Erling Harland so you had points there for definite Arsenal keeping a clean sheet lots of people have those in their teams as well. Uh for me, Dallow was the the star of the show with 12 points and um uh in barely any teams as well um because but he's a bonus point magnet. We were talking before uh um not many people have got Dallow. I think just me and uh Tom Freeman who I'm going to be recording with tomorrow have him. Um but yeah, he's an an actual bonus point magnet, but no one ever sees it apart from owners because they always concede. So you I I'm used to after 60 minutes seeing Dalow on top bonus and then lose it. So it was good for him to get that finally. So >> yeah, nice differential for you there. I don't think I've seen Dalow on a in a single team this season. So nice points there. Just on my team as well, I think it's a good example. Um, you know, a good lesson in FPL as well. Last week I was frustrated because I sold on the wild cards Sessi Kuna, Cherokee, Semeno, Ekit, Florian Vvers, and they all smashed last game week. >> I could have went chasing after those guys again, but I just rolled the transfer. They all blank and then my guys come good this week. So, >> it's um you know, you don't try and catch lightning in the bottle in FPL. You got to you got to be patient in this game. >> Yeah, definitely. So, those that didn't have such a good gameweek this week, yeah, heed those words as well. Um, three weeks ago I had my worst game week of the season. The following week I had my second best. Just got my second best again. Um, but so I and I did nothing. >> So that that that's the key there. Do if in doubt do nothing. And also um you know have some faith in some of the players you got unless of course you know and the stats know and the eye test knows that they are actually rubbish. Um but none of these players are obviously. So um done well there. Um okay, let's have a look and see how this team is set up for a bench booby. So, I think you you may well be the only content creator who's going to be bench boosting this week as well. So, we'll talk about um we'll go through this and then afterwards we'll have a look at the fixtures and we'll talk about chips in general. Uh especially with perhaps triple captaincy in mind for other other people this week. >> Yeah, triple cap is definitely very attractive this week. I can, you know, I expect 95% of people to go that way. Uh but just the fact that I wild carded in 24, I wanted to get the bench boost, you know, played as close as possible to the wild card and I've been lucky not to get any injuries >> along the way and I've been able to roll a transfer since then. So all going well, I will get the bench boost out of the way 26 and then have three frees for 27 because I'm, you know, don't have a wild card for later. It's going to be much harder for me to navigate blanks and doubles. So I want to get to four or five freeze as quickly as possible. So, the team, the bench boost is ready to go. Uh, there's 2.6 2.6 million in the bank and there's two frees available, but hopefully that will just, you know, turn into three free transfers for next week. The bench boost, I quite like the look of it. Um, I'll talk about the bench players first. I've got the two Wolves guys, Jos Saw and Mane. Uh, not expecting, you know, I'm not expecting much from this bench boost. If I could get 15, 16, 17 points, I would be delighted. Mann's been looking really good. You know, he's taking corners. He's looking good from open play. and he's getting the minutes. So hopefully he can even if he just pick up an assist or or you know one return over the two games. Harry Magguire is doing well for Defcon. He's goal threat. He's got West Ham. So again hopefully can get me a six-pointer there. Maybe an eight-pointer. >> And James Hill has been really good at Bournemouth for Defcon. And I don't mind the fixture away to Everton either. >> So that's the bench boost. H again give me 15 16 points. Happy days. Move on. Starting 11. Martinez is home to Brighton. I've got my triple Arsenal then for the double. Gabriel Timber Dean Rice and I think I'm going to captain Deck and Rice. We'll talk about captaincy options in a second and I think Gabriel will be the most popular but I am you know being different for different sake this season. Muno's home to Burnley is good. I think he'll be a popular transfer in for managers this week. I've got inumo and Bruno away to West Ham. Rogers home to Brighton along with Martinez. Cole Palmer home to leads looks great especially when he came off after 61 minutes. So hopefully that means another start. Jared Bowen at home to United. Don't love that. And that's probably where the temptation comes in to make a transfer. >> And Thiago as well obviously plays, you know, a really good Arsenal defense, but Thiago fixtures afterwards I quite like. So he'll probably stay. >> Yeah. So I mean looking at that bench boost there obviously for your team absolutely ideal. I would be gobsmacked if it's less than 16 points. That's just for turning up. You got to factor in the defcons as well. So maybe you can get up to 20 some save points for SR who is going to concede both but save points. Uh Manet um if he can get anything a goal or assist and also um if there's any sort of goal or assist from Meguire or Hill who you know who can get attacking returns as well. So I I would say you're looking I would be I'll be very surprised if that's less than 16 and I think it could I don't think it'll be like you know million but 50 or something but it it you could get up to 30 which would be an outstanding benchoids boost um score there and then you've also got to factor in so if I'm saying that's sort of 16 and this will lead into the sort of chip talk really so uh currently I've got a triple captaincy on Gabrielle at the moment Um, so if I can get 12 points, two clean sheets, a bit of defcon, if I can get that up to 20, that's that's an extra 12. So maybe maybe a couple of extra 16 points. So already bare minimum, I think your bench boost is going to be the absolute the the likely score for Gabrielle captaincy, triple captaincy. Rice as well could be similar as well. I think you could be looking at maybe getting sort of 12 points across the two matches for him because you factor in the defcon he gets clean sheet points maybe an assist or two. Um so you're factoring that. So I think I think already the bench boos for you this team looks really good but the reason we're going to talk about triple capsy a bit more is because most teams won't be like this and we don't want everyone to switch off go oh great FPL German's going to get really good score because he's got an unusual strategy that we can't follow. Um so um we'll look at that. But yeah, it is it is it is uh I think you you should feel confident going into game 26. Put it that way. >> Yeah, it feels good. It feels good. I guess the only concern is because it's a midweek game week that, you know, there could be a bit of rotation across the board in teams and >> just get, you know, getting 15 players out is, you know, I need that to happen for the bench. But, you know, the players that I have, I don't think that's going to be an issue. They're they're 90-minute men. They're starters. >> Yeah. you know, Palmer's always a bit of a concern, but you know, he seems to be getting Premier League starts at the minute, so that should be okay. >> Yeah. Um, definitely there. And and so I will probably be bench boosting game 33, which will be a double game week, the biggest double game week uh that we'll have. Um, so I'll be wild carding at 32, but I'll have the I'll have the same and other people doing that as well. We'll have the same, you know, will the players you pick actually play twice? Will they the the ones with two fixtures that is, you know, will they will the others show up? will will there be an injury by the time you play your wild card and your bench? So, you're always going to get that. And the later on in the season, the I think the bigger the threat of rotation. So, you're probably wise to get it out the way. Let's just have a quick look at the fixtures before I look at Arsenal uh assets in uh detail for for some chip use this week. Um so, we've got gameweek 26 to gameweek 31. So, we can include gameweek 31 now because we know about the blanks. So Arsenal and Wolves will blank but they double this week. Arsenal play Wolves and Brenford away. N Wolves of Nottingham Forest away and Arsenal at home. So a chance of returns there a possibility for the likes of Manet and Sar even as well. U Bournemouth are absolute top. So you you've got Hill in place there. He is my um transfer I'm probably going to bring in um because he's cheap, he plays gets def and he's got great fixtures. And I have Michael Keane. So those of you with Michael Keane, I think the indications are that Branweight is going to replace him uh or at least come in. So we assume it will be Michael Keane. Be a doubt. Either way is a doubt. Man City, great fixtures. They're those keeping um uh them um but uh they will also blank in game 31 I believe um because they uh are through to the final as well uh that week. Uh Liverpool great fixtures. Sunderland, Nottingham Forest, West Ham, Wolves, they got great four, well, five, my god, they got a great six fixtures. They got Tottenham uh who who who are, you know, very much can concede. And my team Brighton, who um somehow have conspired to being one of the most well-run clubs to being an absolute shambles on the pitch, um which Bugen ran to the bench towards the end to to be seen to be asking the manager who is playing left back? Okay. Uh Aston Villa, great fixtures, Brighton at Brighton at home. Wow. Uh leadeds at home, Wolves. And then they got Chelsea, Manchester, and West Ham. Arsenal obviously got good fixtures with that double, but they're good anyway. Uh but they've got Tottenham and Brighton, but they do have Chelsea in the mix. Uh but still good. Um looking through uh Chelsea, two great fixtures, and then their fixtures drop off a cliff, so we might be looking to move Chelsea assets on game 28. They do have Leeds and Burnley up here. So, just thought we'd do this before we chat about Arsenal in general, but um obviously your wild card was based largely on this. So, you you're you're well set up for this. Um and um I think you probably endorse me getting Hill in who's in your team and because Bournemouth are top. >> Yeah. And he's Hill's about to score 15 points on my bench boost. So, now's a is a good time to get them in hopefully. >> Yeah. Bournemouth have been top of the attacker for a couple of weeks now. um you know, Senessi Hill, these guys are are good options because they're very good for defensive contributions. Interesting differentials now as well. New signing Ryan has looked good. He hit the crossbar the weekend and he scored a great goal. >> Although Lucadine uh put it on a play for him to be fair, just let him walk past him, but a very good finish all the same. And you know, he's come in as a very exciting prospect as well from from a bit of reading I've done about him previously. So, he could be a differential for people looking for one fixtures there are very nice. Manchester City. Some people will be wondering looking at the ticker why Man City and Wolves still have a fixture here in 31. I think it's because there's a small chance that the game can get rearranged and still stay in 31. So FPL website have removed the fixture. Okay. >> But I think on scout they're just leaving it there um until we get confirmation basically. So City probably won't have a fixture but there's still I think it's a pretty tiny chance that >> the game can stay there depending on European results etc. Liverpool I yeah some nice fixes coming up again pretty soon I'm not overly keen you know sundering away forest away is probably pretty good at the moment echiki florian verts I lost them recently but I feel like there's a good chance I will own at least one of them if not both of them again at some point you know west homes away home brighten away you know 28 to 31 looks pretty good villa I have set up with Martinez and Morgan Rogers so I'm pretty happy with that looking at the fixture ticker And then yeah, we know Arsenal. Arsenal have the good ones. So I'm very happy on Timber, Gabriel, and Dean Rice. >> Yeah. Um okay. Um let's have a look at some Arsenal triple captaincy options. Um so I've got um up on the screen here. This is for all starts. This is all the Arsenal players here. And um before we just look at some of their stats there, um it's good to look at it sort of in context of of where we're going to go with the um with the with the chips and and that sort of strategy there. And so it's worth saying so a lot of people going to be using the the triple captaincy or not using the triple captaincy, but so the question still remains, who do you captain this week as well? So we'll go through some of those options there. The bench boost obviously for those like Mark who've actually sort of planned for it and set up for it, it's a really good week because you got the likes of Mana you can put on the bench as well. So where does this fit this particular double game 26 fit in the sort of coming gameweek? So as we said gameweek 31 is going to be a blank for some teams as well. So we have to be prepared for that as well. Perhaps a free hit may be used for some hopefully not for most people. Game game 33 will be the main double and that will be influenced by the FA Cup uh results as well. So, we don't know who that's going to be, but we we know it's going to be uh the biggest of the season. There is a possibility of a further double in gameweek 36 and that is possibly involving City uh against Brenford and Burnley. There is a possibility Liverpool could get Chelsea and Aston Villa and the possibility that Villa as well would get Burnley and Liverpool and that's going to involve a variety of things. So, if City reached the FA Cup semiinal, which is highly likely, you know, because they're a good team. Um, so that's possible there, but you have to factor in what City team's going to show up if they've already lost the the league by then and they're already looking for the cup competitions um against Brenford and Burnley. So, you could put it on Harland, but we've seen already Harland can be benched. Um, and also we also but Harland can blank as well. So, we have to weigh up whether that possibility of that even happening is as good as one of these Arsenal assets as well. Liverpool or Villa, that's going to be even harder. I think it's something to do with the I think is it with it if one of them reaches the FA Cup final or the Europa final uh in Villa's case, I believe. Um but we'll know a little bit more about the time. in in essence it's an outside chance that there'll be a double that will involve them but it may not happen as well. So we come back to gameweek 26. So I think it's probably quite a good time on the basis of that it's probably quite a good time to play a chip a bench boost if you plan for it or a triple captaincy and that will be as you said most most most most players thinking of playing a chip there. So we have to think of the options and as well as captaincy as well. So I've got up on the screen all the p all all all the main contenders really. So I'm not going to start with the top one which is Gabrielle in terms of FPL points. I talk to you about Rice. So you've got the armband on Rice. So therefore if you were using the triple captaincy this week you would put the triple captaincy on him as well. >> Yeah. So yeah first of all just on the triple captaincy you know whether or not to play it you know thinking about what might happen in the future. I think just keep keep FPL simple. That's what I always try and do. We know exactly what's happening this game week. The best team in the league have two games. They're good fixtures. They've got really good FPL assets. So, I think this is a really good week for triple captain if you're not using the bench boost. Um, >> you can wait for something later of course, but there's no guarantee, you know, fixtures fall the way we want them to. It was pretty scary for me there looking at a possible Holland double game week that has Brenford home, Burnley away. So yeah, I would rather people use their triple captains on Arsenal this week and and make that game week less scary for myself of course. But back to the Arsenal guys, I I think for me, personally for me, because of the season I'm having, I I'm 1.4 million. I believe the best captain, triple captain this week is Gabrielle. Um I just think he's the he has been for a long time now. best Arsenal asset, you know, huge threat from set pieces, defcon, and clean sheet potential of course as well. So, if I was, you know, top 100k, top 50k, you know, really gone in for a really, really good season, I would go triple captain Gabriel this week and I wouldn't overthink it. But because I'm chasing >> and I'm open for more risk takingaking this season, >> I really like I've only owned Rice now for two game weeks. So I feel like, you know, I've missed out in a lot of his points this season. And it's just I don't think there's a huge amount between Gabriel and Rice when it comes to captaincy and points potential. I would put your slightly higher, but it's it's just going into it then hope hoping maybe, you know, even though I have double Arsal defense, if if they don't keep two clean sheets, then, you know, if Rice can get an attacking return or two, he can he can very easily come out and top in in a double game week. >> And I'm not concerned about his minutes, you know, he takes a set pieces, he can get the defensive contributions as well. >> So, that's that's the thinking for me. I think it's definitely between these two. Um, I've got Timber as well, but there's always, you know, I think fullbacks are always a little bit scarier for captaincy and triple captaincy in a double because, you know, Ben White, etc. could come in and play a game. So, I would say best triple captain this week is Gabriel, but I'm going to take the differential route and probably go Deck and Rice. >> Okay. Well, let's compare them stats wise. So, in terms of FPL points this season, this is these are stats for all all seasons so far. Gabrielle's on 135. Rice on 134. So not much between them. Gabrielle is a defender and he's on three goals and two assists. So five attacking returns. Rice midfielder, many more attacking returns. So he's on 11 uh four goals and seven assists. So Rice overall has got more returns there. Rice is actually a little bit better at getting Defcon. He's got8 uh per start. So that's almost every other game. Gabrielle 7. So once again, so there's not much between them there. Um but of course you've got to factor in the clean sheet points. So Gabrielle um can get clean sheet points obviously as defender. Rice can only get the one as a midfielder. So Gabrielle will get four for a clean sheet. Rice one. So that's going to that that I think is the key difference there. And they have two games where they can easily get clean sheets in. Um obviously in terms of chances great Rice is is superb 47. Gabrielle's only four. Membership ownership rather is absolutely huge. Gabrielle will probably be the most favored and he is in more teams. But Rice not too shabby overall. He's in more than a third of teams. Gabrielle in two and five teams. Um minutes per expected goal involvement non-penalty. Obviously Rice is much better than Gabrielle there. In terms of starts, Rice is better, but Gabrielle was injured. So that's what that is. So they're both nailed on we think. Um shots not bad. 15 for Gabrielle, 33 for Rice and on target. 12 shots total for Rice. Four on target. This is the most interesting one I think. always think about blanks and chances of getting returns. So, Gabrielle has blanked in four of his 18 starts. Um, that's 22%. So, there's a 22% chance that he'll blank, but then you got to factor in that's two matches. So, I think there's a very strong chance of returns there given that it's quite rare that he blanks. Rice has blank nine times out of 23 starts. Still pretty impressive. And by blank, I'm not counting three points as uh as an actual return. That's like I'm just saying that cuz you'd be pretty unhappy if you got two times three points. Um so nine out of 23 sites that's every 30 that's 39% as well. So obviously in terms of wanting as as as Mark was saying who is the best captain option, Gabriella I think has to be there because the chances of blank because of the four points you extra you get for a clean sheet are much uh much more minimal than than Rice there. >> Yeah. And again, it's for me, it feels like if you know, I'm going to go with the differential rate with Rice. I'm sure other people will cap triple cap him as well. It's there's not a huge amount in it. >> Gabriel will definitely be the most popular. Uh, >> but I expect both players to score well. So, even if Gabriel does outscore Rice, I'm not expecting it to be by a huge margin. I think I'd be pretty unluckly pretty unlucky if, you know, Gabriel goes massive. Yeah. >> And Rice blanks in both games. Um Rice really really close to scoring again the weekend play as well. So, it's, you know, it's not just set pieces we're getting Dean Rice for. Um, you know, I've seen a lot of people, you know, post on social media, you know, Decken Rice is such a boring pick, etc., etc. But, you watch the games, he's so heavily involved. He's in the box. It's it's not a, you know, it's not a defensive midfielder Decken Rice here. It's a very it's it's an allrounder player who's almost everyone goes through him in that Arsenal team. You know, a bit like Enzo at Chelsea for example, Bruno Gamarez, they're all very similar this season and they're all performing really well. could even say the same about, you know, Dbury Hall at at Everton as well. So, there's there's loads of routes to points for Deon Rice. There's loads of routes to points for Gabriel. >> Hopefully, both players smash it and we're all happy. >> Uh, again, part of it's probably the fact that I will probably keep Eager Thiago >> and, you know, if he does wipe out a Gabriel clean sheet, I'm probably okay with that. If I've got Deck and Rice captain, >> then I'm just, you know, banking on some returns for attacking returns for Deck and Rice. It certainly feels like going into a gameweek the the floor for Gabriel seems higher because I think >> you you're probably going to get at least one clean sheet. I think we'd be surprised if there was zero clean sheets here for Arsenal. So Rice really needs a return then and maybe even more than one. So yeah, it's it's something I'm willing to take on. >> Yeah, I've got Thiago. I think currently he's in my side, but he's against my triple captain defender. So I I feel uneasy about that and I feel I could go all in. But then I would be for me in my case it would be Anderson from Nottingham Forest who whose floor is four points. Um so I'd be looking at somewhere between four to seven points. Whereas if I play Thiago and he does score and gets bonus, then I will be annoyed by that if I if I bench him. But then I guess maybe his his ceiling is probably maybe eight points. So there's probably not much in it if but it would just be annoying if he I'd like to get some points if he canceled out my triple captaincy. I think that's sort of hedging my bets there. Yeah, I think Hedgun's sensible there because >> it's Yeah, I think just it just goes back to, you know, never benching penalty takers and >> if >> if you have triple Arsenal defense and they concede against Brenford, you're going to be annoyed, quite annoyed, but if you've got a little bit of an insurance policy with Diago, whereas a lot of people have already sold Thiago and more will sell him this week. >> So, yeah, I think if you have him, you got to play him. >> Yeah. Yeah, he'll be widely benched this week as well. Um I just think and Anderson's got a great game at home to Wolves, but still with him he is four four to seven points um there. So um but yeah, let's have there's just before we move on to a thing I've got about Arsenal's defense. Um there are some other names here. So you mentioned Timber as well. See, he doesn't have as many routes to points, but he is still very attacking. Um minutes expected goal involvement, nonpenitent every 365 minutes, which is very very good for a defender. Defcon very negligible. Got two goals and four assists so far. He's had 23 shots and created 20 chances, but just five of his shots on target there. So that's basically sums him up there. He's a good option to have not possibly a captaincy option. I think one of the next four will be the top scoring one, but which one it is, we don't know. And and whoever gets it, well done. But I don't know which one. We got Zub Mendy here once again. Another goal. Oh, he's only 5.2. He's got five goals and an assist. So, five goals is pretty good for that. Um, he's got 22 shots so far. Oh, he if he scores twice, then I think he'll be the the top scorer, I would imagine, over this time. You got Trosard as well, um, five goals, five assists. Will he start both games? Possibly not. But if he does, he's got a very, very strong chance. Once again, got attacking returns at the weekend. Um he's he's in hardly any teams if you triple captained him. Um uh I think he will end up being the best. But will he? Definitely. I don't know if I could put that hand on heart. He's only got 92 points, but that's cuz he's had 15 starts, but 35 shots, which is um second best on this one. Uh and chances created at 27 chances created, 10 of his shots on target. So I think he's strong. Jocker is as well much maligned this season, but he has scored eight times and he has got quite easy opposition this time which he does score against. He has 37 shots the most on here. Um only 75 points but because he started 18 times um there Maddoi a goal and an assist and I put him in there because Saka's unlikely to make this double but he could make the double. He's being um he could end up being back of the week and so we don't know there. So that probably counts Madaweki out because we don't know whether Saka will return to take his place back. But nevertheless, he's had 13 shots and 15 chances created from his nine starts there. So there's a good bunch here if you want to be. So you're already being different um captaining Rice. Um but I think the real the real lads this week are going to be the the ones that are basically making their team as they're skydiving. These are absolute devil may heroes and heroins of the week. One of them will cap triple captain Trosard jockzmeni perhaps Madaweki and they will end up uh with the best score of the week. Um anyone they know. >> Yeah. So again looking at the table Gabriel number one rice if you want to be different number two. You can take another step towards differential 30 with timber. >> Yeah. Then you just go completely off the wall with Zuma Mendy Trard Yawker as Mek. He actually didn't even mention Celiba. You know, he's, you know, a very safe differential, but you know, maybe the it doesn't feel like the ceiling's there, but >> how many times have we seen double game weeks and center backs like John Stones, Ruben Diaz come to mind, you know, absolutely smashing it, getting 27 pointers. So, maybe this is Celiba's time, >> if you're on Celiba, you absolutely keep him. Of course, >> the you can we can, you know, I think this game is going to run for, you know, over a week. Um, but you can already see it once that second Arsenal game takes place. the the official FPL account will tweet about someone who has triple captain Zuba Mendy or Yokarez and they've got, you know, 50 points. >> Yeah. >> Um after their Yeah. after their skydive. So, it's it's it's it's going to happen. One of them will at least one of them will do really well, you would imagine. >> But good luck. good luck figuring out who that's going to be because you know any of those trust jockers as mowi it's >> it might be 120 minutes across two games but again that might be enough for you know a huge score but I definitely favor sticking with the the steady Eddie guys that we were well familiar with >> um okay here's another table um which s for me cements Gabrielle being best captain or triple captain um so already yeah he's got over what he's got over Rice is he's blanking in far fewer games as well. So there's some kind of returns are coming. Um but this is uh stats for all season of defenses expected goals conceded, goals conceded, clean sheets, etc. Um Arsenal are top, but they're not just top, they're in an absolute league of their own. They were they've been expected to concede 16.6 goals this season and they've in fact conceded 17. So they're not under or overperforming. They are doing exactly as expected stats say. They've got 13 clean sheets at best. And so they're conceding uh um expected goal every 146 minutes. So not even every match and a half. Um the next best is Manchester City who expected to have conceded 28. They've actually conceded 24. They've had 10 clean sheets. Minutes per expected goals conceded 86. So within a game they're still expected to concede a goal um there. Then you got Newcastle every 29 minutes. Um they've conceded 36 goals and only seven clean sheets there. So uh it it just in context Burnley the worst. They expected goals conceded they expected to conceded 50. No 49.39 and they have indeed conceded 49. Not over or underperforming just terrible. Clean sheets three. Pretty poor minutes are expected goals conceded every 49 minutes. So pretty much a couple a game for them. Um so this just this just for me this highlights the the benefits of the defense. And so some people have got triple defense. So if you've got triple Arsenal defense plus you triple captain Gabrielle you've got 10 potentially 10 lots of six points if there's no deathcon for example which there will be. So you're actually if you get two clean sheets in this double and you've got triple Arsenal defense and you triple captain Gabrielle, I believe that's 10. So you would have 60 points just from that. And if they get defcons, well add that all up and if any of them get attacking returns or Rya gets bonus or bonus. Yeah. For any of them. So that could be huge. or they could concede both and that 60 points is just a dream. But these stats do say that they are in an absolute league of their own. Um although the last defender I captain was Shane Duffy, but captaining at Brighton center back. It's really different captaining Gabrielle. >> Yeah, it's um we all remember Shane Duffy. It's it's funny. He moved to Celtic for a we while during co and >> I I ended up cap I think I triple capped him in a in a double game week in in the Scottish game and he made up for what he didn't do when we did it uh back in the day. I think he scored in both games. >> Anyway, tangent. Every time I look at Arsenal numbers on tables like this, I'm just amazed by how far ahead they are of everyone else. They are, >> you know, one of the best defensive teams we've ever seen in FPL. And I think those that are on triple defense this week or are on two Arsenal players and are looking to add a third, you know, defensive asset or goalkeeper, then you can be very confident going into the game week that you're making a very very logical decision. Um, you've no control over what happens in terms of Arsenal keeping the clean sheets or not, but you're setting yourself up, like you say, for sounds like if you have triple Arsenal defense and a triple captain Gabrielle, you could get 100 points from those three players alone. So, uh, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out. Um, and yeah, I think, yeah, you can be very happy going into the game week with triple Arsenal defense. >> Yeah, I mean, basically, if Arsenal do keep two clean sheets, we're going to see an absolutely mega um, uh, average score um, and the safety score for like whether you get a green arrow or not is going to be absolutely huge um, there because also you got some bench boosters as well. You could be probably look forward to if they planned it 16 points at least there. If you if we get a triple Arsenal or two Arsenal clean sheets, chuck in a Gabriel goal, it's going to be a pretty pretty insane game week. >> Oh, it' be absolutely huge. Um there it might not be. Um meanwhile, let's have a look at just catch up on the latest midfielders as well. There's a lot here. We're going to we haven't got time to go through all of them in detail and all of their stats as well, but some of them we've already mentioned here. Um some will be perhaps I think the focus will be Arsenal um for this double gameweek but um for for the next game week as well I think there might be starts start moving some shifts of of midfielders um and people wanting to to get the new next shiny toy as well. Now looking at the fixtures Brenford's fixtures improve quite marketkedly. Um they've got Arsenal home but then they got Brighton at home. That's brilliant. Then I think Thiago's captaincy, we'll look at that, the captaincy matrix in a minute. Then they got Burnley away, brilliant. Bournemouth away, brilliant. Wolves at home, brilliant leads away. That's a tricky one. So they basically got after Arsenal, four great games in a row for attackers, especially Bangotara um is top here in terms of minutes per expected goal, expected goal involvement, non- penalty from just two starts. Um he's had six shots. He's already got two goals and an assist over that period. This is the last six game weeks. Um his ownership minimal, not even in 1% the team. He's had six shots. He got 22 FPL points over that period as well. I'm seriously considering getting him in and doubling him up with um Thiago there. So just you mention I mean would would you I mean you you were happy with your midfield at the moment but obviously it's changing and when you're looking you'll be on the lookout for a midfielder at some point. >> Yeah, Dango's been really good at Brenford. I always liked him at Bournemouth. Um, Brenford, great signing, another great game week. The the issue is there's always five other midfielders. You know, I think in any other season, previous FPL seasons, we'd all be, >> you know, earmarking gamewe 27. Get Dango. Um, but the reason he's only 1% owned is because we have all these good midfielders. You know, he's >> he's never going to get into my team ahead of a Rogers or a Rice, you know, >> Bruno Fernandez, Enzo Fernandez, all these players. There's that's what goes against these really exciting differentials this season is there's there's so many really strong midfielders at other teams. So Dango certainly on the radar. I think those like myself as well and yourself if you have already got Thiago >> it always feels a little bit harder to double up on a on a team like Brenford. But again they're having a really good season. So it you those four fixtures if you're ever going to do it it's I think gaming 27 is dango time. Yeah. Um, you know, if I pick up an injury, for example, if a Rogers was to pick up an injury, something, he will be he'll certainly be in the mix for replacement options. >> Yeah. Um, just as a spoiler here for those listening as well, Rogers isn't on this table. That's just because he didn't hit the minutes per expected goal involvement non- penalty. That is because a lot of his shots are the sort of goals that other players don't score. So, his his XGI stats always quite low. And I know as an owner of recent weeks, two points, three points, oh, 10 points, two points, three points, 17 points. That's going to be that's basically it. So, he's going to do but he is going to do that on a regular basis uh as well. So, Rogers isn't here, but you can you can be rest assured we are endorsing getting Rogers in. He's a good buy. Salah surprisingly minutes per expected goal involvement non penalty 120 minutes. Actually a really good asset here. Um he's got two assists so far. is 14 million though, so that's going to be tricky, especially when you got Bruno Fernandez coming up at 9.8. Uh, now um Defcon, he can get that one every four games or so. Got five assists and a goal. Once again, he halls again. A reliable captain, uh, 23 chances created, 12 shots, minutes of expected goal involvement, non-penalty, really strong as well. Great option here. Martin Elli creeping up here. I don't think many people are going to get him in just because his security starts, but it's worth noting he has very strong minutes of expected goal involvement on penalty stats as well. We've got some others here. Sharda as well is suspended at the moment, but could come when he come back. Could be good option. And I'll just stop here with Ryan as well, who you've mentioned a couple of times already. He's only 5.5. He's only had one start and a sub appearance. He's already got a goal and assist. Looks great. Um um three shots, three chances created. So, it remains to be seen if he can keep delivering points, but already with Bournemouth top of the fixture ticker right now until gamewig 31. Well, that's as far as we've gone up to. Um, yeah, he does look I'm I'm tempted to get him in, I must admit. Uh, when I'm looking to make a midfielder transfer in 27 28ish. >> Yeah, he looks really good. You know, same price bracket as Dango. So again, I think like you when it comes to making my next midfield transfer, if it's going to be a sub6 million, I think I'd be more inclined to take a punt on Ryan rather than going double Brenford just to, you know, hedge hedge bets a we bit there and just have a you little bit of interest in Bournemouth fixtures, especially when they are top of the ticker. But yeah, certainly early signs look really good for for Ryan. >> Okay, I'm going to I'm going to sort of race through the next lot and sort of stop for for any comment from you before we move on to forwards and the captaincy matrix. So, we've got a lot to pack in. Um, so yeah, lot Enzo Fernandez is here, which would be good news for people like me when you just got him in. Uh, great news for those that had him for a long time. Three goals and an assist. When Palmer's not there, he's on penalties. Uh, and we've seen that Palmer, even when he gets a hat-tick, can be substituted off. Um, 12 shots there. Um he's a great asset to have 6.9 but Chelsea's fixtures uh drop off a bit of a cliff in when signing game at 28 when they got Arsenal then they got Villa Newcastle and Everton but leads Burnley at home doesn't get better than that um coming up for them. Brian Bowmo is here. Three goals. Um but minutes per expected goal involvement, n penalty still very good at 163 minutes. Uh there he's getting expected to get a goal involvement. Nine shots uh four chances created. Sacka is going to come back soon as well. So less we forget he's pretty good. Um his minutes per expected goal involvement penalty on a par with Brian Bowmo and Vertz as well. Um eight he's 8.4. Liverpool's fixtures really improve now. Sunderland, Nottingham Forest, West Ham, Wolves, brilliant. And then Tottenham, Brighton just gets better and better for attackers there. He's really strong. Four attacking returns last six. Casemiro's put in here for those Devil May Care people. That's actually really attacking. One goal and an assist. He could have scored again the weekend. Uh Defcon as well as pretty much every other game. Uh 11 shots he's had. Pretty good. Turkey as well. We don't know about starts. He only started three, but he has got a goal. Always looks great when he's on. Ishmael Sar very popular as well. Crystal Palace's fixtures really good. Burnley and Wolves. Um he's he scored the last couple um two goals in the last since he's come back um from af uh sorry since he's come back. Uh yeah, so three starts there he's had there and he's seven shots. Um Deucebury Hall another to consider. Yeah, I could go here if I need an enabler. Really strong option and as we'll see in the captaincy matrix, he could actually be a captainy option coming up. Uh he's only 4.9 goal and assist from his two starts back from injury. Harry Wilson, I'm not sure about him. His minutes expected goal involvement nenalty every 204 minutes. Still really strong. And Fulham's fixtures get really good after they get Man City out the way with Sunderland, Tottenham, and West Ham. I just don't know because there's so many I want all of these players here. And then we got Rice at the bottom here. Um really strong uh every minutes per expected gone every 250 minutes. And we just spoke spoke about him to death really. Um, but the reason I've got so many in here is there's so many options, so many differentials, so many ones that are just absolutely reliable captaincy picks as well like Bruno Fernandez. Um, and I haven't even put Palmer in here. He just didn't make the minutes per expected goal involvement non- penalty because because of uh, you know, lack of minutes, but as we've seen got a hatrick in 60 minutes. So very you can we're endorsing him as well just for the next two. Yeah, I will just very quickly uh give you my opinion on each of these players. Enzo really good pick. Embuo really good pick. Saka not an option at the moment. >> Floyd and BS great option. Fixes improving soon. I miss owning him already. Casemino is a no for me just because Bruno defender would be better. Cherokee love him but minutes are not so good. Prefer at the moment. >> Isar great pick especially if he keeps penalties. We're not sure, but even regardless, I think he's he's a good pick. >> Dooby Hall, ridiculously good pick at 4.9, you know, brilliant fifth midfielder, but whether you need a player at that price is always the question. Harry Wilson, I watched him closely at the weekend. Again, he was in really good positions. There was a couple of occasions where players should have played him in and they didn't. There was one Ry Gne shot where the pass was the move really should have ended up with with a Wilson shot. So I think Wilson owners will be getting, you know, cold feet, especially with all the shiny new toys, but I would urge, you know, bit of patience with Hari Wilson. I think he could be a season keeper to be honest. And then Dean Rice, obviously he's already in my team. So yeah, there's way too many good options in midfield. >> Yeah. Um I think for me Enzo Fernandez will be the one that will make way game at 28 because he's got Arsenal uh away that one. So it's gone from great fixtures to like the worst fixture as well. So it's a good time to hop off then. and uh there's about 20 of well there's not 20 players here but there's a lot of them I'm interested in. We'll quickly look at forwards last six game weeks as well. Um so this is good um from my point of view because I've got the top two and I've got uh the other giant Norwegian meat shield who's a bit further down as well. So I'm happy there. But this is the last six game weeks. Echique is the top minutes per expected goal involvement non penalty every 98 minutes. So that's a goal involvement a gain pretty much um just from three starts but he should start and Liverpool can't afford to drop him at the moment if they're dropping points albe it against Man City if they're dropping points they can't afford to drop their best their best and only center forward really 15 shots two goals um Thiago is next which highlights why he is will be in demand in game 27 onwards um he has got six goals doing exactly what he I love forwards who score, midfielders who assist, uh, get defcons and other stuff, and defenders who get clean sheets. That's that's what I that's what I require, and Thiago is filling that bill there. And then we got Watkins as well, 8.7. Uh, you and I have Rogers, so we might not double up there, but he's still an option. And the fixtures are really good with Brighton leads and Wolves coming up there. So, um, there's a few there before we we move on to the others. >> Yeah, Eatique remains really high on my list. I was I was close to keeping him over Bowen on the wild card and I expect to hold him again in the near future. He missed a glorious head of chance set up by Salah. Really should have been on the score sheet against City. Thiago I kept him because I think he could be a season keeper. Watkins I'm concerned about because in any fixture Tammy Abra Abraham could get a start. Wouldn't be surprised this midweek if Tommy gets a start for example. I think Watkins played about 85 minutes at a weekend. >> And if Watkins does start games it can be 65 minutes. You know we've seen that when Min was there as well. Even Neilson to me has been looking a bit better in recent game weeks and maybe been unlucky not to get more returns. So maybe a little bit more interested there with and we know Bournemouth have the fixtures. Um I won't mention the next guy. I don't know who he is. And then we're we're on to a few more at the bottom. >> Yeah. So the next guy there is Harland who's 14.9. He's actually taking a bit of a price uh drop. Uh I don't I think that'll probably halt now um after lots of blanks. He got two goals. He's got two two goals and two assists in his last six um there and obviously did well at the weekend uh against Liverpool there 20 shots um uh just that one sub appearance but the rest he started with his ownership obviously huge is in seven in 10 teams um and it's expected goal involvement non penalty strong so he is still obviously a strong asset um at Man City a second to Bournemouth in terms of fixtures difficulty jockarez here as I said we've spoken about him for Arsenal um uh a very strong uh differential if you wanted to get um a differential player in for Arsenal. Maybe not captain. Krooppy is still really good value as well getting subbed off 60 70 minute but he's got three goals. He's only 4.7. Um so yeah, another really strong asset and he he's um competing uh in many teams against Manet or just having three strikers. So I've got Harland, Ekatik, Thiago. So I'm not dipping down. I'm sticking with three, I think, especially with the the fixtures improving for many of them. J Pedro here, his time's running short uh because of the fixtures, but the next two are glorious with leads and Burnley at home. Um he's got seven attacking returns in the last six. That's immense. He's got three goals and four assists. Re he did he basically was doing J Pedro Brighton things at the weekend, earning penalties. That's what he specialized in. When he was at Brighton, he actually took them as well. So, but you still get points for penalties. And then Manise bringing up the rear here. I just put him in here because he's of interest to people this week. Two goals and assist. He does have Arsenal, but he also has Nottingham Forest and his minutes expected goal involvement non penalty strong. And he played in more of a number 10 role at the weekend as well, I think. And I I think the comments from the manager were that they're going to stick with that um stick with that sort of formation. So, he'll play a bit further forward. So, that's good news for you as well. So, >> yeah, >> lots of options. Striker time, I think. >> Yeah, I like the 18 shots there from Manny. You know, jumps out at me. I quite like that. I know a lot of them are probably speculative and, you know, low xG shots, but he's good. He's getting them away. Crooppy, I agree. I think he's just a really good player. And >> even if it is 60, 65 minutes, he's just really good value at 4.7. And yeah, Joe Pedro owners are very happy. He's the He is the king of winning pens. He was at it again, especially that first one. Manufactured it very nicely, and I was happy because I'm a Cole Palmer owner. >> Um, but yeah, Joe Pedro for the next two looks good. >> Yeah. Um so with ETK Thiago coming into great b of fixtures you've got people you got players like Evan Nilson as well. You got Harland obviously going to be many many teams and then you've got the likes of Krooppy and Manet offering value as well. I think the people who will take note of this table here and their formation and their 352 setup will be the Mark Gee owners as well because they've got a dud there who doesn't play and so immediately there are three strikers teams can have um and and or or if you want still wanted to have a 352 you with a say Krooppian as your first sub that is still way better than Margui. So, I think it's those sort of managers that need to sort of I think review um their formation setup. And personally, I'm sticking with the 343 just nice and easy. I'm not going to bench any of these lads. Um there. Um let's have a look at the captaincy matrix before we go. We're getting through a lot today. Hopefully, hopefully we'll get in within an hour. >> We need we need to lay down after this. >> I know. So, capture matrix. This is the final one. Okay. So, gameweek 26 Arsenal double. So, take your pick. We we've done that rewind if you've just come if you just for some reason just sort of coming into this video that's what we talked about earlier. So uh but brilliant away to West Ham good. Harland are home to Fulham good as well. So you can actually go away from Arsenal there. Game 27 Harland against Newcastle. I think that's where I'll go. Thiago against Brighton is very tempting. Bruno Fernandez away to Everton is quite good I think. and Palmer as well. Obviously Palmer I keep leaving out. He's at home to Burnley. Um I think when I did this, obviously Palmer hadn't done scored his hat-tick there, but I think we can put Palmer in the in the captaincy conversation now there. So for you it will be Palmer game 27. >> Yeah, all going well and no, you know, major setbacks with his injury that he's carrying. Um yeah, Palmer home Burnley looks really tasty for me. >> Okay, game 28. Thiago way to Burnley. Good. Harland away to lead. Okay. Bruno Fernandez at home to Crystal Palace. I quite like that. Echit home to West Ham. I I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't actually qu I mean Harland's like lead's born, but it's okay. But I think I don't know. I mean for you I mean you Harland's out the picture, but game 28 you I've got I've got choice. You've you've got choice as well. >> Yeah. I think it's a pretty open week because you know leadeds have been really good at home and then Arsenal played Chelsea as well. Um, even United against Crystal Palace on paper is not the easiest fixture. You know, Palace might be about to, you know, improve a bit as well. So, possibly Thiago way to Burnley might be the one that week. >> Yeah, I might go for that. So, this could be like a t for for me as well. Um, it could be Thiago two weeks in a row. A game at 29. Harland home to Nodding Forest. I think that's where I'll go. Sack away to Brighton looks good. Uh, Dbury Hall at home to Burnley I think is pretty good. Ech away to Wolves is good as well. Once again, it's wide open and that that Dubsbury Hall at home to Burnley could be the one. >> What has what has FPL become? We're talking about Keenan Dooby Hall as a possible captain candidate, but at 4.9 million, have you ever captained a player? Probably not since Harry Kane when he was, you know, sub 5 million in his first season. >> Sterling. Sterling I might have done when he was cheap. Have >> possibly. But yeah, that looks like another fairly open gamewe for captaincy. uh Brighton, Arsenal away to Brighton, Chelsea away to Villa, Liverpool away to Wolves. There's nothing nothing jumps off the bad part. Obviously, Harland's the the obvious one there at home to Forest. >> But the me the message here as well, I think I think your policy of going against Harland is absolutely fine at the moment anyway, but it's also fine in terms of the captaincy because there's so many good um shouts and some of the weeks here arguably the the the other picks are better um than Harland. >> Yeah. What's helped me recently is Bruno's emerged, you know, under Michael Carrick. He's really, you know, elevated. And hopefully now >> Cole Palmer, you know, I went into the season planning to really rely on Cole Palmer as a captain and and hopefully I'm at the point now where I can actually do that over the next couple of weeks. >> Yeah, definitely. Okay, we've rattled through quite a lot there. Um, uh, good luck with the game week. Good luck, Mark. Good luck those watching and listening. Um, we'll be back again next week, I think, because I think it then then goes normal again in terms of game weeks. >> Um, even though there will still be the second match to go for Arsenal, but you know, obviously we'll skip that and we'll um we'll we'll be we'll be here every month, every Monday whether or not. Um, okay. Thanks a lot for your time. Take care. See you soon. Cheers all. Best of luck mid week.",

    "transcript": "First off, my dilemma this game week is whether or not I want to hit the bench boost or triple captain or neither. Now, I'm going to tell you where my current head is at. I think the big decision for me is the triple capy. Now, I always, always, always and it's who I am, Chris will always want to play the triple capy in a different week than others. Now, I do feel like it is very, very powerful this gameweek. And not only is it good this gameweek, but it's what it allows you to do in other gameweeks. Gameweek 33 is the other option where you could use your triple captain as things stand and that will be a very very popular week to bench boost. >> I don't love that bench as much as you do. For what it's worth, I would be going um triple captaincy this week given those two two options. >> You do raise a good point, but for me I I kind of look at it um kind of the reverse way as well. Like if one of the Bravasi or Anderson keep a clean sheet in any of these difficult fixtures, the likelihood is that they're on at least the 8 to 10 pointer.",

    "published_at": "2026-02-08T12:19:47+00:00",
    "transcript": "Hello everyone. Welcome back to another stream on Fantasy Football Scout. Today, Chris and I are going to run through my gameweek 26 team selection. A lot to talk about as we go ahead towards double game week. Uh the first double gameweek 20 uh the first double gameweek of the season. Um and I myself am considering triple captaincy and also bench boosting as a potential option. Chris, how are we getting on? >> Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Right. For once, I'm not coming in with a tail of woe after after backto back 26 27 and 26 pointers. Uh last week I got my 66. This week I'm on a big green arrow for me. I'm on 67 points so far, two to play. So I I'm moving from just outside four million in two weeks to just hopefully inside inside three really. And then I'm on my route that the fight back starts here. I'm looking forward to a big double game week as well to try and boost that further. >> Yeah. I wonder. >> I'm happy. I'm happy. >> Yeah. Good. And as you'll see, um, we're seeing incremental g gains from both of us and you'll [snorts] probably see that across the board along a lot of content creators as this is where the planning stage of the season comes in and this is where we make our money. Um, but there is still lots to play for and that's for sure. this particular double game week. I don't know if there's going to be too many games because again because there's only two teams that are doubling. Um, you know, I just feel like everyone is going to have, you know, near enough the optimal triple up and even if you don't have that third option, I don't think, you know, it'll be detrimental to your rank. So, it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. But the big games, Chris, that we need to talk about, and again, we'll talk about it a bit more when we get on to my team. Triple captaincy. I think this will be a very, very popular week to triple captaincy. Have you talked about it? >> Yeah, I'm I'm pretty much on it. Um, as as you'll have heard if you you've tuned in to me and whilst we were talking about Chai's team, I've been telling you my tales of WoW. I I I just need I need to keep the momentum going. I I I want to get inside that top uh at least the top 1 million, which my worst ever finish just outside 1 million. So, I want I want to get inside that. Oh, 94 points. Very nice. So, I someone in the chat there, Luty Lui has has got 94. That's great. the chili p I I I I I sense but yeah I want to get inside that so I I need to kind of do it now I feel to to take advantage uh and try and keep that momentum going um it's as much psychological as it is is a practical uh decision but I think it's a good opportunity I mean I I get that Harland will may well have a a double later on um you know and by that point he might have started scoring [laughter] again but uh but I I I I think I think the uh I think the Arsenal if you're ever going to do a defensive captain and a defensive triple captain now feels the time. The Arsenal defense looks formidable. Gabrielle's picking up, you know, bonus here and there and defcons here and there and obviously got the goal threat as well. I I'm I'm triple captain Gabrielle >> for sure. That's interesting. I wasn't expecting that. >> I'm on it. I'm nailed. Yeah, I'm I'm in. I'm I'm I'm all in, my friend. >> And I haven't heard too many um that are too confident on doing that. you know, there is a lot of discussion on it and I can get it. Now, if you're asking me, uh, again, I am considering it, but when I look at the perks, Chris, um, of doing it, again, Arsenal just look like one of the best defensive teams we've seen in a while. Um, and also, he's very, very good in terms of defcon. Now, he only hit seven this game week and again there is still stuff to play for this game week with Liverpool and City and one other game. But I I think he is a phenomenal option for sure again along with the goal threat and the two amazing fixtures. Now they're also away fixtures which in my opinion >> would increase the appeal for Defcon. Like if you're asking me I would prefer two away games with Defcon and that goes with Declan Rice. Um [snorts] I was looking at Royce's returns before I brought him in. Oh, sorry. I'm after knocking your face off, Chris, so I can't even bring that up. But don't quote me or don't quote me if I'm wrong, but I believe um he's hit Defcon six out of the seven games which were away. And that's Declan Rice. Um again, I'm just going to look through to make sure I'm not wrong here. Uh but I believe a lot of his defcon has definitely come away from home. And it's something to consider. >> Yeah, I I I think um Can you hear me still? I can't hear you. >> All good. >> There you go. No, it's cool. I don't know. Yeah, I I I think you know hopefully home team feels it's got to go for it. Like you know Brenford actually if I you know of the two the Brenford clean sheet I feel a bit more concerned about Brenford have been pretty good at home. Um you know they're finding a way with with with obviously Thiago with Lutara with with Sharda with a few others chipping in. They're they're they're decent this side. This this this attacking outfit despite, you know, losing uh losing some some great options. So, I think I think um I think that's but as you say that plays into Defcon. Like Brenford aren't going to sit back at home and and and put all men behind the ball. That's not going to happen. So, so I think I think the defcons are there. Um and I think it' be an open game. It might be that you know the opportunities in that one are more attacking and and defcon for Gabrielle than than they are. I think Wolves I I feel a bit more confident that that you know that Arsenal can shut them out but if they don't I've also got Manet uh on in my in my team at the moment I've kind I brought him in in the wild card because I wanted to uh I thought this is opportunity this double likely coming up and then um and now I don't know I feel I've got to play him now even though it means dropping someone either Rogers Rice you know Jiao Pedro or Enzo um to do that or or MBimo, which I don't really want to do any of those. So, but I feel I've got to play him. Having him on the bench and not playing him he's got a double feels mental. Um, so yeah, but I think I think yeah, Defcon's you're absolutely right. I I think that Defcon's um you know, you obviously got more opportunities when players um when teams come at you and and and I think Wolves have got nothing to lose really, right? And and Brenford are are I think are just an attacking team by by by nature at the moment. So, so yeah, I I think there'll be devcons. >> Yes. So, >> I can see Brenford be hang on in the chat here. We've got Mal Malaki Fox. I can see Brenford beating Arsenal. What do you think about that? That's a big That's a big shout, isn't it? >> Yeah. I mean, Kee Andrews has done very well this season, I have to say. Um, fellow Irishman, he's doing very, very well. But, um, when it's Arsenal, it's a different story. [laughter] Like, they're a very different kettle of fish. Um, but you know, let's see. Again, two away games. You never know what might happen. But that leads us on nicely, Chris, to taking a look at my gameweek 25 score so far. Now, >> yeah. How's it going? How's it going? How you what you >> just to contextualize things for anyone who is unfamiliar here, Chris and I both wild carding gameweek 24. So, that is why we're hopefully well set up for gameweek 26. Um, and why my game 25 score is somewhat of a decent score. So, let's quickly take a look. Now Chris, you know here we are absolutely not unfamiliar to doing things a bit different. Let me quickly read out the team and leave you have a look at my team. >> On goal we've got Robert Sanchez fourth to back Anderson, Gabriel and Timber with Trevor Shalaba beside him. Five in midfield, Fernandez in Enzo and Rogers with the armband and Declan Roy with that had hit defcon. And up top we've got Erling Halen. On the bench we somewhat got the order right this gamewe. Dravka, Krooppy Jr. Sness and Manny. A week where a lot of people actually hit the bench boost. First off, Chris, before we start at the start of the gameweek with um the Friday Night Football and then Spurs United, Rogers captain finally got some sort of return this gameweek and you know >> I love I love the Rogers captaincy. I love you because you're so you just go for it and I love it and and I'm so happy that came off for you. Obviously because Fernandez also hit 10 would have been a big captaincy choice as well. the differential hasn't massively hasn't proved as as successful it would have been but but still I think that's great and Roger's he's a great asset I I love it I love it I've had him as well I've got his I did the other way around I got Fernandez captain and Rogers you know just in this in the side so ended up with the same uh the same kind of uh hall there but I love it I I I think you've got to got to be a bit differential and and um to to to get gains and I I you know it's come off for you so I'm really happy >> yeah so Let's start um I suppose we could start with Leads and Forest. I mean big win for Leeds. >> Yeah. >> Now on the same points as Tottenham and we can also get onto the Tottenham game because everyone seemed like they captain Bruno Fernandez and also own Brian and Bumo. >> So let's start with leads again. Um first Chris, great question to start us off. Ellia Anderson, born or not born? Uh four point ceiling or four-point floor? >> I don't know. Is is it seven in a row or something crazy? I think it's it's he's Yeah, I mean, yeah, I I think it's Yeah, you're right. You say the ceiling and the floor are kind of the same, but but you know, if you've got someone chipping four points, it's one of the reasons I've had Rice, you know, I'm happy to stick with him even though he doesn't do much. The Defcon's come in, it's four or five points each time and he gets assistance. I think the problem the problem with Anderson for me is it takes out there's so many good other midfield options that you know like I say the four point the four-point ceiling possibility um is uh is less attractive. Um but yeah I I I have I've not owned him all year. I I've looked at him a lot but I've never owned him throughout the season and and um maybe maybe game week one. I don't know because there's a lot of fur preseason but never owned him. I've every time I've looked at the midfield, I've looked at him, but there's just always been more attractive attacking kind of, you know, assets. Obviously, you know, Rogers has been great. Fernandez is backing and Bumo's good. Like Rice, as I say, has been solid. I I guess beyond that, yeah, [snorts] Enzo is uh is is a question mark for me. I've owned him before. He did okay and he's doing it. He obviously got the goal last week, but but yeah, a bit disappointed with Enzo. Come on in a minute. But yeah, Anderson I I'd say Anderson's fine fine to hold. I wouldn't be charging in there though, especially not the way that Forest are kind of combusting a bit at the moment, you know. >> Yeah, if I'm being honest, um like throughout the season, I had owned Anderson. And I for what it's worth, I think he's a great pick. I don't think it's necessarily about what Anderson can do. And by the way, if you're asking me, it's a four-point floor, not ceiling. Again, I do think he is capable of getting over four points. and he is genuinely >> he's capable, but how often I'm going to look at now in the last five he's got it um four times over four points. So [laughter] I'd like to think that it is definitely a floor. Um and just on Anderson, it's not necessarily about Anderson, it's what he allows you to do. Now there is, you know, a good discussion to have about there are other options that you know will score more points than Anderson. And you're right, it is all about timing. But the hard part with everything in life is timing everything. And if you can have a player there who's going to tick away nicely and that allows you to get someone who's more expensive, whether that's a Cole Palmer or Bio Saka later down the line or if we go back down the line of a Foden for example. Well, that's where you're going to make your money off a more of explosive player leaving you. >> Do you think do you think I think that's a very good argument and but I I've not felt this year that money's been a problem and I think that's because we've not had to own Salah, right? So I I've not felt really that often squeezed. Maybe the odd time there's been a 0.1 in it, but I I've not really felt I couldn't pretty much get to who I want with with two transfers and and have good options. Not I mean my obviously my performance this year has not been good, so you shouldn't listen to me. But have you found that that that budget is a a constraint this year? >> Yeah, I I think this goes down to you know the pricing not being where we particularly wanted to be. I think that's fair to say. This season we've been able to play with 15 playingers. It's the first time uh ever I think that we've had, you know, 15 concurrent players throughout the whole season because the likes of Muki who realistically probably should have been priced at 4.5. You have the likes of Anderson H, Richards and >> um any 4.5 whether it was Sessi rotating really really well and they probably should be priced at 5 million. Defcon has just made these players really really powerful and even players that we would have never considered Declan Royce um you know Kaisedo they've been >> which was the point right which was the whole point of the defcons but I guess they're going to have to adjust yeah pricing with that in mind next season >> but that's why the pricing has not been an issue it should be an issue pricing in F should always be an issue and consideration like I should not be able to get everyone who I want um like and that's why I feel like um you know everyone last game we had Bruno Fernandez and likely in Bumo. Um, and that was because >> I did. >> Yeah, [laughter] exactly. No one didn't No one wanted to spend the money on a Bio Saka because now you're paying 10.5 for, you know, an asset who loses, you know, less of his value because other options are so good for way cheaper. ETC, Declan Rice. So, I do I do think it's a case of pricing. Uh and then like you said, no Mo Salah and Liver a lot of teams who you know you'd probably expect to do a bit better than than normal even even though they've fell off over the last year or two whether that is a Tottenham for example um or even Chelsea who haven't had >> you want to talk about Tottenham. >> No. Okay, let's talk about Tottenham. >> Let's talk about Tottenham. So I I went into the gameweek not captain Bruno Fernandez and as you can imagine as soon as that red card came true. Let's actually talk about the red card. My heart was in my mouth of course because it was you know Tottenham losing a red card and [laughter] FPL points going against me but >> I know >> just on Romero because again this is a very big talking point. One about Romero and two on Tottenham. Yes, we are looking like we're in a relegation battle now that West Ham got a result yesterday but also just on Romero I think it's right to say that you know it is a bit mad from him. We know he has that in him. >> But for me, what annoys me about it is, you know, the likes of Ali McCoy on on um commentary like we see this almost happen every single week, a challenge like that. The thing is it's not given consistently that it's a red card. And I feel like as soon as it's Romero who makes a tackle like that, it's an automatic red card. He doesn't need to think twice about it. But if it's any other player in the league, and we've seen it week in week out now, and as soon as that happen, >> I do agree that the the I mean, this is always a problem. I don't actually think like V's necessarily helped it, but like the the inconsistency on certain decisions. I think maybe Romero is going against him. He's, you know, I think maybe it's that the players involved like how they reacted and and and and everything that that that made it look it wasn't a clever challenge, right? And it was the very least a caution. But yeah, it's it's it's tough, but he's he's a captain. He shouldn't be making challenges like that like in the first place, right? So, I don't know. I don't I I it's it's it's tough, isn't it, with and and obviously that put put Spurs set Spurs right back, you know, and and bit of a hiding to nothing after that really. Um going down to 10 men straight away. Um but United played well for outside Romero. I mean, United look a different team right now. I mean I mean I don't know if he's going to get the job. I I he's got he's making a good fist of it. If he gets in the Champions League, I expect he will. But they just look a different team and I I don't enjoy that fact as a you know who wants to see United succeeding. No one but like you know apart from United France but but they they look a different team. They playing people in the right positions and and and options and that means for us fantasy options like Fernandez has become a bit of a must and Bumo is a good option. You know Kun even an option. There's like the defense [snorts] I had dowo for ages when they had great fixtures. They delivered virtually nothing but now you know he he's back as an option again. Um, you know, I I I think that United's are now very much United assets are very much in the mix for me. Um, uh, now, so I've got two. I've got Fernandez and Bumo, but you know, I can see at some point having a third, but are you serious? It's some argument. There's some argument in the chat about something, but I'm going to leave that go. But yeah, so but what about what about Spurs? Obviously, Romero, I get the challenge. What do you think? Yeah, you don't have any Spurs assets. Do do you think there's any case for for for for for you know at any point we're going to come from a fantasy perspective into Spurs assets or I mean the next few games are tough as well. You've got um Newcastle, you've got uh Arsenal um what's what's the third game after that and Fulham away which you know not that that easy in itself. So you know how are you feeling? Spurs aren't really coming into the into the conversation at all are they from a from a fantasy perspective. >> Yeah. So just on Billy says if Chai didn't have his Spurs boys he'd be in the top 10K and I don't think that's true. The reason I went against captaincy this game week is because I thought it was a good opportunity. I felt like everyone and their mother was captain Fernandez this game week and had a double up with Embo. I felt like Spurs could keep United at a shush for a while and you know we didn't I actually thought with 11 men we we played quite well. I I thought, you know, I seen a lot with Adogi and and Shavi Simmons linking up very well and I was happy with how the game was going and it's exactly what I expected from Thomas Frank. Again, he's a great record versus the big six, as you know, true Brenford. Again, maybe not necessarily at Tottenham as of yet. Who knows where he'll be in the summer, but >> I did feel like it was an opportunity to go against Fernandez, even though he did have chances. And the goal, the first goal, uh again, 10 men, you likely have a man on the edge of the box. I spoke on my deadline stream about you know people are asking about Brian and Bumo is he work captain and my argument against it was first off I'd rather go Bruno secondly if there is a manager in the league who knows Brian and Bumo better there is no manager better than Frank% >> so that was my argument and then the goal came from a set piece which you could have never accounted for these things happen >> and again it was smart from United and we just weren't ready for it and then the last goal was by Fernandez of course and again the game is stretched we have to throw everything that we can bring on subs, whatever. So, not that like again Fernandez's hall was well due. Again, he got lots of chances and generated a bit. He could have even had more with the likes of Cesco. For me, I fancied Morgan Rogers. I thought it would be a quite open game away at Borma. Um, I still deem Villa one of the best attacks in the league even if their XG don't look like it or whatever you want to say about it. XG philosophy will have their own opinion on it there. But, I did think it was a good opportunity. He came up with a goal early on. Max bonus played very well. 11 defcon just one offer. And again, I I didn't make um you know, any any gap here because Fernandez did match him and even Gabrielle had returned and also Erling Holland is yet to play. So, not quite worth the risk this game week, but I was happy with the decision and again I do it twice over. >> Yeah, it's good call. I don't have a problem with you captain Rogers. I think it's good as well. It's good for the game that that players are not just sticking between. I mean it was you know it was captaincy in Harland still is for a lot of players you know but but you know that's really boring it's not great for the game if people leave their captaincy that's one of the key decisions each week right so you don't want to be always sticking the same option so yeah I applaud it and and hope it comes off I still remember the crazy words was it Vert's captaincy you brought him in for a week or whatever you captain >> my captaincy has been all over the place this season captain Bruno versus Chelsea in gameweek five I think it was like it's been everywhere but >> in very enjoyable week in terms of FPL from my perspective. Even if I don't end the game week on a Green Arrow because again there is still Brighton versus Crystal Palace, Liverpool versus City. Before we move on, Chris um again 450K to 370K currently. I'm happy with that. I'm always happy with [clears throat] my team regardless of the rank as as long as I'm seeing returns. Like it means that the players I've picked regardless of the outcome um you know have done something. And lastly, I want to just ask you again, we do have Liverpool and City. How do you see this game going? Again, I'm a bit on the fence. It is a really tough one to call. >> I mean, I I I see it goals on both sides. I don't see either of those defenses locking out the other. I mean, City are a bit stronger since, you know, they've reorganized Gay Gay come in, but I I I I think there's going to be goals both sides. It is it is annoyingly the sort of game that Harland could could, you know, get the opportunities to get his his shooting boots back. Um, is no way is it going to be 3-0, mate. Uh, that's I will I will I will I'm not going to put my house in it, but that's not going to happen. I I'd say like I I I could see like a a one all or a two all. Maybe the odd goal either way. I think I think there's going to be goals in it and and I think it should be a good game, but um yeah, there's a three-0 prediction in the chat. Let's let's hear the rest of you. I the frustrating one slightly frustrating for me is is is is ech wild card. He's a player one of the players got rid of and they've done nothing for me. I think he got like five points in five games. Uh it didn't play too adittedly and and then yeah suddenly he pulls up that um pulls off that that hole. What do you think about about you know about Echitique as an asset? >> Yeah, I I really really love Echit as an asset. I spoke about him throughout game weeks, even when he was blanking on my own channel. I'm just a big fan of a player like a Katik. He's, you know, that big ego who is not afraid to come on no matter who his teammates are, do a few stepovers, take on his defender, and shoot even if he's 30 yards out. And that's just the type of player he is. And again, playing for Liverpool, it's very rare that we have a a consistently starting number nine with Alexander Isac out. You know, you look throughout the seasons and the only one who was playing really consistency consistently since Bobby Firmino was no one really. He had Darwin Nunees, um Joe Goata dropping in and out. So having a Liverpool number nine, if they can get their stuff together, I still feel like it's very powerful and going from gameweek 27 when they play against Forest. The fixtures look phenomenal and they also have a fixture in gameweek 31 and have a good chance to to have a double in gameweek 33. So very enticing. >> Yeah, I'm I'm gonna monitor him and come come back on him. I mean I I I have the whole question of I mean I you know I guess the other flip side of that is how long you should stick with Holland. I think the fixtures look great coming up after this one um for for City but like you know a couple more blanks. I I don't know how how you kind of feel you've like Harland is like a tax in the game like if you don't it's like an insurance policy you kind of have to have him in but I I he's not been delivering the points that someone at that price tag you know anywhere near that price tag is is is at the moment so I I don't know I'm I'm I won't I won't check him out but yeah apparently I know this is true in the chat someone said that Har's never scored at Anfield I'd have to certainly check that but you know if that's true he's definitely going to score Okay. [laughter] >> Okay. So, Chris, before we move on, uh, give us your score prediction for the game. >> Exactly. Um, so you we're going to talk about this week 26 a bit and and and is that the plan? >> Yeah, let's talk about gameweek 26. So, um, let me quickly pull that up. Um, so here is my gameweek 26 square. Let me quickly run you through and then we'll talk about some of my dilemmas. First off, two free transfers in the bank, 2.7 million. um uh value to spend. On goal, we've got Sanchez, a three to back with Shalaba, Gabrielle, and Timber. Gabrielle currently has the the captaincy armband. We have Fernandez, Indi, Enzo, Rogers, and Rice up top. Erling, Halen, the Manet on the bench is actually quite good. We've got the Brava, Krooppy Jr., Sessi, and Anderson. First off, my dilemma this game week is whether or not I want to hit the bench boost or triple captain or neither. Now, I'm going to tell you where my current head is at. For me that's a you know a very very good bench in my opinion >> it is. Yeah. >> I think the big decision for me is the triple capency. Now I always always always and it's who I am Chris will always want to play the triple capency in a different week than others. Now I do feel like it is very very powerful this gameweek and not only is it good this gameweek but it's what it allows you to do in other game weeks. Again we have chips to spend and we have what 12 gameweeks remaining. >> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. the only other options realistically and again we we are unsure of the land landscape currently but >> gameweek 33 is the other option where you could use your triple captain as things stand from my understanding um and that will be a very very popular week to bench boost so I will have um an overlap in in chips you know I could easily bench boost this week get that out of the way and do neither and that will mean I have to use two in in uh in weeks that I I'm unsure that what they look like >> so I think using ship does make sense for me to do this week. >> What do you make of a bench first off and again just on triple capy again before you c you go on about that? I feel like there is a lot of value going a bit different on triple capency. Sure Gabrielle could knock it out the park. >> Um but what if I got it on someone who was a bit differential later down the line, a bit more exciting. And what if Gabrielle does blank? Not that it is likely, but we're looking at a minimum floor of like 10 points here for Gabriel. I I I I had my last triple captaincy was on Harland I think uh when he got like nothing uh two points or was something ridiculous. So um yeah so I'm I'm maybe not the best adviser. I I looking at the bench is the first thing you ask me. You you pick it away to Everton though. Krooppy Junior Sessie I mean Everton you know the the Hill Dickinson's not not a fortress. I'm obviously Everton fan so insight into that. I I I think that's a game Everton going to go in thinking they're going to win to be honest. Doesn't mean that Creepy Jr. can't score. doesn't mean Sness won't pick up Defcons, but I don't think that's an easy game. The way Everton are playing at the moment, it's not incredible, but we're in good form. We're we're, you know, we're winning, we're drawing, we're, you know, I think lost one in the last six or seven. So, you know, and and and we've got our players back apart from Greish. Even Barry's in and Betto started scoring. So, like I I I don't think that's an easy one. I think they're good players. I think they're good picks. I'm I'm envious of both them. I've got Hill uh and and Manny. I think I didn't I didn't go with Kuchi in the end. Um Anderson obviously as we talked about you know there's a you know that's a interesting one a way to see Dravka away to Palace. I mean at the moment I'd say Dravka of those is most likely score the best points. I think Palace Palace just don't look on it at the moment and and I kind of I I I worry a bit for Palace. I think they're going to be safe because they're you know they're a little bit further up the table than than some of the dropping but they just don't look at it. They just don't look obviously they've lost players. you know, the manager's going like a few of the players thought they were going and not going, so their heads maybe it's a bit where's Mate's head at? I don't know. I don't know. I think Palace look kind of in I don't want to say freeall, but I I I I don't think it's the same Palace we've seen other points of the season. So, I don't love that bunch as much as you do. I I would if for what it's worth, I would be going um triple captaincy this week given there's two two options and I'm I obviously I'm doing that as I said earlier. But in terms of differential, so where are you thinking? Rice, Timber, Manet. Are you going you going Manet triple captaincy? That would be the ultimate maverick chai move. Where where would you think of going for for for for the triple captaincy if it isn't Tim Gabrielle? >> No, if if I were to it would be on Gabrielle. I don't think I'd ever put it on a Declan Rice again. If it was Bao Saka, I would have definitely considered unfortunately picking up that injury last game with just on the bench Chris because you do raise a good point. But for me, I I kind of look at it um kind of the reverse way as well. Like if one of the Bravka, Snessi or Anderson keep a clean sheet in any of these difficult fixtures, the likelihood is that they're on at least the eight to 10 pointer um like if if Burnley do keep a clean sheet like you can imagine the Bravka is heavily involved. >> Um Everton they love a long ball with Betto >> and Barry Sessi clean. He's 100% going to go defcons. I don't think there's any doubt about that. >> Yeah. So I don't think it's the worst bench and again it's not necessarily all about >> I didn't say it was the worst bench. I just said I didn't love it. Yeah. No, I I just mean that like I can understand what you mean and like later down the line is why I would use it this game week because again, >> but if you're if you're thinking later down the line there's going to be a bigger double and there's going to be, you know, you're going to face most of your bench doubling, surely that's a better time to use it. >> Yes, I would agree. But the problem is I've already hit the the wild card and it's all fine and dandy having lots of players doubling, but getting to them after a blank game week and blank gameweek in gameweek 31, that's the hard part. And again, >> no, I get it. If I just look >> Okay. No, the bl the blank's going to be a challenge. I mean, I've got I've I I if I don't play I'm up to four free transfer at the moment. If I don't I'm not planning to do a transfer this week, so I'll I'll be up to five. So, I'm up to the max. So, I've kind of deliberately tried to do that to bring into give myself the mini wild card and and to be able to cover, you know, the the blanks. And I think that's the strategy is to be able to kind of cover that without using a free hit. But no, I I think that's fair enough. you know, you're a long way up ahead of me in the table here. So, I I I am I'm not going to tell you what you should do. I I just don't love that bench. Um I And I think I also do think I think triple captaincy Gabrielle is a bit of a maverick move. How many triple captaincy how many how many triple captaincy um defenders have that ever been? Like I mean I can't think of many cases where people have gone for that in a big way. Um so that's a maverick. If you want to see Maverick, that's kind of Maverick. >> I think it'll be a very very popular thing this week, Chris. Personally, I think it will be um I'm just trying to think of Gabrielle's effective ownership. I think it could be over 200, which is for a defender, you know, even over 200 is rare. >> Yeah. >> Again, I mean, he's the safest safest way into that Arsenal defense. I mean, there's been a question in the in the chat about whether Salab is a good cover for Timber, 100%. I Celiba outsc scored Gabrielle this week and you know he's also defcon's it's not maybe like the goal or assist kind of threat really as much as as as as as Gabriel or Timber might have but but I think SBA's and he's a little bit cheaper I think isn't he I think I I was looking I mean similar it's around the similar price tag I was I was looking at Ca when I went to Timber in the end um but I think it's a fine I don't know who asked that it was Carl Bax something or said it's a suitable differential I think I think it definitely is I I know some people have got trouble trouble Arsenal defense um which is a bit much but I you know I I I don't hate that. Obviously people got riers some people got three defenders. Um so yeah I don't know. I'm I'm going to do it. Um I I I I I buy I do buy though. I do buy what you're saying. I I I think that there there's going to be other good opportunities. This isn't the only opportunity the triple captain. But I also do buy what you said about using the chips and and we've both gone wild card early but it's not that early. And like you say, there's only a certain number of those games run out pretty quickly. Um, and you know, you've got to use the chips. I've ended up keeping bench boosts the last day of the season when it was totally pointless in the in the past. So, you you want to you want to, you know, maximize those. Um, uh, and I I don't see a problem doing it like now. Um, Gabrielle just has to beat like the six points I got from from Harvard last time to feel like I've had some success. I think he's going to do that. Um, yeah, that's cool. Can I ask you a defensive question? I you've got double Chelsea defense. I'm s looking at Sanchez being kind of annoyed by him every week so far. Two early two weeks. Like how do you feel about Chelsea defense? The fixtures look great, but they don't seem to be able to keep a clean sheet at the moment. So, you know, if you if you didn't have double Chelsea defense, would you still be going into it? I >> Yeah, I just want to touch off uh the the bench boost just lastly before we move on. Um, so again, one of my biggest issues with waiting and until the gameweek 33 to use the bench boost is all the fixtures who are blanking in gameweek 31 are the teams that bl that double in gamewick 33. So again, because I'm on wild card, um, you know, Arsenal will double in 33, which I'll be holding on to anyway. Crystal Palace doubled in 33, City and Wolves, or not Wolves, sorry. And then you have other teams like Newcastle, [clears throat] uh, Liverpool and Chelsea, Burnley and Brighton. So in my current team, you know, no Bour doubles in 33, no Villa doubles. Um, you have Arsenal, but I have to survive the blank. So makes it a bit awkward. So I don't think I'll have a full stack going into that game week anyway. On the Chelsea assets, Chris, I think you're absolutely right. Um, I'm not sitting here confident at all with Trevor Shala and Sanchez. But what I would say is that's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes with goalkeepers. And to be honest, with the fixtures ahead, there'd be no way I'd be getting rid of Sanchez or Shalaba. Shalaba has at least been good with the fact that he gets Defcon nearly every single week. He's been an absolute warrior for it. Looking at his leads at home game, I wouldn't be confident at all looking for a clean sheet. But >> no, I can I can see Lead scoring it. I think Chelsea will win it. I can see Lead scoring it though. I I think that's the thing. Yeah, it's a shame. I mean, I I I I was gonna have Sanchez and Char, but then I went to Sanchez um end zone, J Pedro, and I was kind of happy with that decision. Talking of Chelsea, this is this is one in the chat. >> Exactly. Perfect. >> Palmer's just hit a hattick. >> Yeah. >> Any thought at all that we've still got these good fixtures ahead? Still got a few good fixtures ahead. Is there anything in you at all going Enzo Palmer? >> No, absolutely not for me. Again, I'm quite strong opinionated on this. Um, you know, I just feel like, uh, sure, he's coming in at a great time. Fixtures are great. Uh, I do think definitely think he's a good option. I would definitely not knock him to be, you know, a good option, especially with those fixtures. I mean, anyone who's on penalties for a big team like Chelsea, of course, are going to be a good option. But I just feel like if that was Saka who had gone and scored two penalties in an open play goal, nobody would be ranting or raving about him to be honest. Like I just feel like there is a bit of hype around Palmer because it's Palmer. I think people forget that like before Cole Palmer like we're not used to Palmer scoring open play goals. always been a lot of penalties and there was a lot of frustration earlier in the season when we owned him or in the in the last season where you know he went quiet for so long and you're paying a big premium again the fixtures are still uh good up until probably gameweek 28 but do you really want to hold on to a player for you know two game weeks and the fixtures get tough and even in that postmatch press conference you know he spoke about you know how he's hasn't felt his best and he has to play every single game not knowing if he's going to wake up the next morning sore which he's not used to, you know. >> Oh, yeah. You could you could bring him in and he could be out. It's every chance he misses the the the the lead's game. That's on that because it's a short it's a short turnaround, right? So, it's entirely possible he's rested or he comes off the bench or whatever or he comes off early and he's not going to play nightly either. That's the thing. He's definitely not going to be playing night. So, I guess that's, you know, you've got to hope that the damage the penalty comes when he's on the pitch and the and the damage is uh is done then. But but it's hard not to have your eye eyebrow raised. I like, you know, I like him as as a player and he he obviously has that talking ear about floors and ceilings. He does have a big ceiling as he's just proved. So yeah, I don't know. Leads and Burnley, I can see why people would consider the punt. I can definitely see it. But I I I do agree with you that maybe, you know, you could you could you could come out of that feeling pretty burnt and spent a transfer and then you have to kind of Yeah. >> Yeah. So my point was like before the gameweek I still hold the same opinion even after him scoring a hat-tick because how it kind of played out. You know he played 60 minutes and got two pens like so he is definitely a good option and I would have said before the game like he was a good option. Um but again it's just would I be breaking up my team to get him? Like I don't look at Enzo Fernandez like if I had the money to do Enzo to Palmer you know I would do it but again I wouldn't be breaking up my team to do it and >> Yeah. Yeah. No it's unlike I mean it's a big differential right. It's a big price difference. It's not unlikely that many people sat there with three million odd in the bank to to just do that. Um so yeah. Yeah, that's fair enough. I I'm not I'm not going to do it, but I can see the traction. I I can if you can do it and and obviously plaud it to the people that did it and you know one of the guys in the chat um went for it. So >> yeah, fair play to anyone who has them. If I if I had Palmer right now, I'd be absolutely buzzing the fact that people like me are not considering. But again, these would just be the things that I'd be thinking about in my current team. And I'm not basically I'm not too pushed about not owning them. And if you do have him, fair play. You know, he's a great option for sure. And he's very much a me pick. Like I wish I'd done sack at the Palmer last game. The reason I didn't is because I didn't have enough money to do it. And I'm also trying to set my team up for the future. So just not something that I'm exactly pushed on. But who knows, next game week, we could see another palmer brace and I'll be eating my words and >> yeah, we'll be sitting there. We'll be sitting there going, \"Yeah, [laughter] but the good thing though is that from a rank damage, it's not going to be it's not likely to be massive ownership, right? It's not the same as a Harland uh you know a Harland uh hat-tick if you if you've not captained him or something. It's it's it's he's going to be relatively he's not going to have the same crazy level of ownership. Um I mean it will go up obviously after this after this week. There's always people that follow the follow the points but um but it's not going to really kill you. Um yeah. Yeah. I'm hoping Enzo can come back with another last minute another last minute goal or you know chip in some defcons or something. um because he's kind of the weak he's a weak man in my midfield at the moment. He's he's the only blanker. Well, Sanchez and Enzo the only blankers this week so far for me. So, um yeah. Cool. Okay. What is anything else? What are the key things? So, we talked about um bench boost. You're considering it. Don't hate it, but I don't love the bench, but fair enough. We talked about triple captaincy options. I'm looking at it and at the moment I'm nailed on to do it. I might I reserve the right to change my mind, but I'm as it stands I've got it on. I'm planning for it. Um, is there any other key kind of decisions? Like we talked you've obviously three Arsenal feels like a must. Uh, if you know, unless you've got a very strong reason not to. What about Wolves? We we both got Manet, right? Um, that's the only real interesting option. Is there anybody else that you'd bring in or have from Wolves? I don't think there is, but I'm asking. >> Yeah, we are coming towards the end of the stream. And for me, I'm very happy with my current team. I I don't think there's any way in which I'll be making a transfer this gameweek. Again, 2.7 million in the bank and two free transfers. And I need to start planning towards gameweek 31. I do think um the only way I could make a move this way, Chris, uh is if I did Yimerson to a Liverpool defender. Now, the reason I like that is because I feel like the bench looks much better if you slap a Liverpool player who's playing against Sunderland. And also for me I think we're going to start seeing a lot of direction uh going towards Liverpool assets whether it is ecat if you don't own him version of van dyke will be back in the mix or Florian vertz again looking at the fixture sunderland forest west ham wolves Tottenham and then they are one of those teams who do have a fixture in game with 31 are likely to have a double in 33 currently from looking at the projections is ever in Crystal Palace when you consider all those things >> h and considering the fact it will be a you know a transfer in the future that we willing to make. Anyway, I do quite like that if I do plan on hitting the bench boost. But overall, I feel like the team is set. For me, I don't think it is necessary for a Jose Saw or a Kregie, for example, who I do think is somewhat of a decent option. He's been quite attacking this season. And Wolves have kind of turned the leaf out. I think it's fair to say. Even though, you know, they mightn't be, you know, getting results week in week out, they are improving. But for me, I'm more than happy with just the Manny. Roll the dice with him and see if anything can happen. And um when you increase the likelihood with two games, of course it is exciting. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Verts. Verts. Verts is the cry from the bench. There we go. So verts. Everyone has a bit of verts. >> But we'll round it up there, Chris. Again, it's been a very enjoyable stream. I'm looking forward to double game week.",

    "transcript": "in the air. Yeah. Thank you. Woo! Heat. Heat. Well, well, well. Hello. Hello. One and all. It's It's almost time, guys. I've put the Arsenal shirt on because it's like an Arsenal kind of day. Well, Arsenal Arsenal kind of day. We've got to wait until Thursday. That's the one annoying thing about the uh double game week, isn't it? that it doesn't really begin until all the way on Thursday and then we got to wait again until uh Tuesday. Um but anyway guys, hello. Welcome to FPL mate. My name is Dan. It is double game week time. It's double game week time. I'm just putting out a tweet about the fact that we're streaming so just bear with me. Um someone says, \"Is the FPL site down?\" Not that I'm aware of. Um not that I'm aware of. I mean, I'm I'm logged onto it right now, so I think it's fine. Uh, the graphic is wrong. Arsenal can't play on the same day. What do you mean my graphic's wrong? I messed up. Oh, that should say, sorry, that should say Tuesday the I don't even know what day. Uh, Tuesday the 18th. Okay, hold on. Let me just update that real quick. Well spotted. Well spotted. Tuesday the 18th. You know, I thought I'd start streaming a little bit earlier today, but actually maybe I just should have spent an extra 15 minutes just ensuring all of the uh graphics are correct. Maybe that would have been a good idea. Anyway, guys, just fixing that now and it should be updated momentarily. But how is everyone doing regardless? Um members, let me know if you're here. Um, and I will say hello to all of you. Um, let's just put this tweet out. And then and then here we go. Right. Oh, we got a super chat already. Right. Okay. Which members have we got here? Carl is here. Uh Trash Pan is here. Max is here. Mark is here. Welcome guys. Welcome guys. And we got a super chat already uh from uh Yugen Raj who says, \"I can't afford Rice nor Timber for my third slot. Should I go Zuba Mendy? I need to replace Wilson.\" I think first of all, I don't think you do need to replace Wilson. Um Wilson's actually a player I'm looking at potentially buying. He has a game against Burnley in gameweek 31. um which is he's he's probably one of the best picks for blank gameweek 31. So I actually quite like Wilson. Would not be looking to um to kind of remove him to be honest. Um if you can't afford Rice or Timber, I think Celiba or you know if you got Rya already, I'm not sure. Um I'd maybe look to go there or I don't know man. I just think Zuba Mendy it doesn't fill me with inspiration. Um, I appreciate he has scored a fair amount of FPL points this season, but I think that's because availability has been his best ability this season more than anything. And he scored a couple of banger goals. I just, particularly as an Arsenal fan, I just don't know. It's the 17th. What's the Wednesday the 18th is when that uh Why are people saying 17th? Maybe it's a time zone thing. Um, so yeah. Um, I just I'm not I'm not at all inspired by the the Zub Mendy pick and I know so many people are so keen on um on him. Sorry, it's Wednesday the 18th. That's why that's why I'm getting wrong. It's Wednesday the 18th, not Tuesday. We will get this right eventually. The Wolves Arsenal game. So, it's definitely the 18th. We just got the day of the week wrong. Well, we're getting there eventually. We're getting there eventually. Right, there we go. Um, right, we've got uh we've got stuff to talk about today outside of Super Mendy because I just I don't know. I just cannot cannot get my head around the selling Zub Mendy. I sorry, buying Zub Mendy or selling Wilson really. Um, so I don't really know how to answer that without seeing a full team. It's difficult to say what your kind of other options are, but I would I would say that Zuba Mendy is like kind of very low priority. I mean that I if I was to rank Arsenal picks right now, I guess I would say number one Gabrielle, number two probably Rice, then Timber, then Rya, then Celiba, then Yarez. So at best, Zuma Mendi is the seventh best Arsenal pick in my opinion of course and you know on a double game week for a good team like Arsenal, do we really want the seventh best Arsenal pick? Few few questions around Califuri as well. Um I wasn't totally convinced by him uh in gameweek 25. Um, and also he's just come back from injury. So given that it's a kind of a Thursday game this week, I wonder if he could be rotation risk. I just I don't think I'd be willing to take the risk there. I don't think the upside is high enough there to um to really be worth going for. So yeah, not super keen on on the Califury pick either. So there are a lot of rogue picks and obviously look if you feel strongly about certain players then you should absolutely go for them but all I can really do here is uh kind of give my opinion. Uh got a super chat here from collage fen says one free transfer O'Reilly to uh will be able to manage gamew. Yeah, you definitely could do. But to be honest, if you if you have a feeling that O'Reilly will play against Fulham at home this week, I don't think it's such a bad fixture to have him. I don't think he's so bad. So, I think, you know, it's it's an improvement on the team, but um I don't think it's an essential move necessarily. I think it's an essential move. Um I still need to um make my transfers, by the way. Uh any team conference, press conference news? Um, yeah, not really too much interesting stuff. And I thought because we're streaming a little early today, we could just go through it together. Um, if you want and we'll kind of answer some questions, genu general FBL questions whilst we kind of do this on the side. Um, so uh yeah, we'll go through some of the press conference news um as well. And uh what we'll do is uh yeah, I there just wasn't too much interesting stuff. I'll put it that way. There was some press conferences yesterday. Uh there's some more today. I don't think we're getting an Arsenal press conference, unfortunately. So, I know a few of you guys may be wondering about like is Saka going to be back? Is he going to damage the, you know, like um like Maw's minutes? What's the Trosard situation? Yeah, unfortunately, uh it is just going to be a case of hoping for the best and picking safely. picking safely, picking sensibly, um I think is probably the wise move as well. Um but in terms of team news, the uh the biggest headline I guess some people I know are looking at Strand Lson. Um Mateta isn't going to need surgery, but Mateta is going to be out for it looks like weeks. So we can certainly consider that team news, I suppose. Uh, in fact, I'm going to just go ahead and start writing some notes here. So, Mateta will not have surgery, but is out for weeks, weeks at least, it looks like. Um, Trayori and oh, sorry, Grant Jaca still out as well, just in case anyone still has him. Um, West Ham apparently have some injuries, but there's no clear idea on what those injuries are. Nuno's kind of kept that a bit secret. Have some um secret injuries from West Ham. Um, oh, Bournemouth. Bournemouth from a press conference from Bournemouth. Bournemouth are going to rotate a little bit apparently. Don't know who, but maybe worries me a little bit about Hill. Um although maybe it should worry Sessi is just as much because Hill is playing very well at the moment. Bournemouth are expected to rotate a bit and uh I don't really know what else was particularly interesting um to be honest. Uh oh, John Stones is back. Uh he was training last last week. Uh and and Kusenov's available as well following his little issue last week. So Kusenov are available. I don't know if that worries uh Mark Gayhei owners at all. Um maybe it should. Uh would you start creepy then? I guess off the back of the Bournemouth thing. Um, it's got to be something to worry about a little bit, but I think mostly the the form of rotation was kind of hinted at because of fatigue. And given that Krooppy is kind of getting pretty early subs every game, he he's probably not one of the players who is probably most in danger of of uh having a a fatigue related benching if that makes sense. So, he's probably just going to play another uh 60 minutes. Hi, Dan. team is Reya De Bravka, Gabrielle Alati Hill, Roland Collins, and Burmo, Bruno Rogers, Wilson, next DK Harland. You is a third Arsenal slot necessary? I think a third Arsenal pick is going to be necessary. Yeah. Um how you go about that, I'm not exactly sure. Um depends how much money you have in the bank. I guess a defender could come in if you can afford to get to Timber or Celiba. Um, not really sure how you're going to get Declan Rice in. You could maybe do Ech to Jockarez as well. Um, if not, is is Rogers to Is Rogers to Rice the one? I don't know. Maybe maybe. But so so you do have some options there. Um, but I would I would do it. I would get that third Arsenal guy. Sir, with the super chat here says, \"Have five free transfers but cannot afford Minor in one move. I can do ciao to Laqua. Uh or should I downgrade Pigford? I mean, you could do um you could do Chiao to be fair, I don't really see the benefit of going for Laqua over Richards given that there is a bit of a price gap there. So, I would go for Richards, sure, over over Laqua, I think. Um yeah, as long as you got your three Arsenal settled, I don't think you need to go too crazy with the transfers. or if you do really want Munoz, make two transfers. If you've got, you say you're open to downgrading Pikford, I'm not exactly sure where I would go to from Pikford. Um, so that's kind of a difficult one. I'm like, who even are the good goalkeepers? I guess Keller from next week looks pretty good. Um, but you probably not the best jumping on point now. Or or to be fair, you could do pick for to Kellaher now and um play to Brava this week potentially as well. That's going to be a possibility. Um that's probably the best I can think of off the top of my head. Really struggling with goalkeepers at the moment to be honest. So difficult to pick them out. Uh Matias says, \"Mr. Deadline on Friday. Was sick in bed. I know it's a huge ask, but if you could look over my team uploaded earlier today to the G Drive.\" Yes, Matias, I will look at your team and any other uh starting 11 tier members. If you just pop your team in the in the Google Drive, I will have a look at it um whilst we've got time sort of in the next hour. Well, within the next hour, I mean. Uh Abdul with the super chat here says Casemiro or Ghana trying to replace Subs? No, neither really. Um, if you're replacing Sasly, I would say that the obvious move is probably is Milasar. I would say not really sure who else I'd really go for in that kind of price bracket. I mean, unless you just you want to go you want to go really cheap and you want to go for like a Anderson or something. Well, not really cheap, but pretty cheap. Anderson, Jupy Hall potential. there is potential there. So that's kind of uh maybe where I'd be looking to go retreat cheap midfielder, but it's minus first of all and that should be affordable, right? So lie to let's see I'm I've not actually owned Soai at all this season, so I don't actually know for sure how much he is. Um but I'm guessing like around 6.5, right? 6.7. Okay. Okay. Well, yeah, that's a pretty simple switch there. And SAR is what? 6.3. Yeah. So, yeah, that's going to be a pretty easy move. If if you're replacing subs, then SAR, unless you're trying to free up a bit of money, in which case I'd just go to Anderson. I think Anderson is just, you know, Mr. Reliable at this point. Um, a pretty a pretty simple one. All in all, Mark says, \"At top 100k rank, if I just captain Gabrielle, if he returns, does it hurt my rank?\" I don't know. I don't know yet. Um, I mean, we can get an idea in the chat of how many people will be triple captaining this week. So, um, are you using the triple captain ship this game week? Uh, and I'll put yes on um yes on Gabrielle, yes on Rice, yes on someone else. And just no is the other answer I suppose. So we get a rough idea on not just how many people are triple captaining, but also where those chips are going. Um, but I have my trouble captain on right now. It's It's activated. It's activated. Has been for a couple of days now. Why not just keep So I mean, you could if you wanted to. Um, I just think there are probably better options out there right now. Um, to be honest, I mean, I'm going to be making some midfield I'm probably going to make two midfield transfers in the next couple of game weeks. Subs is not really even making top 10 for me. There's just I think our our standard our expectations from midfielders just needs to be really high at the moment and because just because there are so many incredible options. There's so many midfielders I want and I know I'm not going to be able to get all of them. It's so frustrating. I want Wilson. I want Ryan. I want Atara. I want Vets. Um and some other guys as well. Rogers. I'd like to have Rogers. How am I going to get all of these guys in my team? I'm simply not. I'm simply not. So, probably looking at selling Rice soon. Probably looking at selling Enzo soon. I mean, maybe in Burmo, but I mean, there's no strong reason to selling Burma right now. It's tough. It's tough. And I've got to upgrade Obi as well at some point. Ready for Gameweek 31. Max said, \"How many gameweek 31 non-players would it take to dissuade you from Tarovski to Minos? I have triple Harland and triple Arsenal, triple Arsenal, Harland, and Gu.\" Uh, non-playing players, how many I mean, if you only have triple Arsenal and Harland and Gu, you're in the same situation as me pretty much. So, I have Obi instead of Gu. And I'm bringing in a new Crystal Palace player this week and it's going to be fine. So, yeah. I it helps when one of your Arsenal players is Rya to be fair. That does genuinely help, but um yeah, I think you should be okay to go for one more. The Australia with a super chat the eur a super chat in Euros despite being called Australia. Uh says, \"Hi Dan, on the fence about triple captain Gabrielle. Do you think there will be better any better double game weeks later in the season? Head is melted.\" Yeah, we've done a lot of content around that this week to be honest. the Australia, but I'm happy to whiz through it quickly for you today. So, uh, I have here my Dublin blank gameweek spreadsheet and I think probably this is the best area to focus on to start off with. So, um, really we've got a double game week 26. We know that's happening. That's sorted. we're going to get a double game week in 33 which almost certainly almost certainly um is going to be a double game week like I'm 99.9% sure there is going to be some double gameweek fixtures in 33 and it should be the biggest double gameweek of the season and therefore unless you've already bench boosted or are planning on bench boosting before gameweek 33 gameweek 33 just looks like such an obvious um bench boost week, particularly if there are a lot of double game weeks, which we have high potential for. There's to be a lot of double game weeks because of the way everything has landed. So, yeah, it's going to be um it's going to be an interesting one. Uh it's going to be the biggest double game week of the season, no matter how we frame it. And uh yeah, that is just that's just your bench boost week or you know, maybe a free hit week. you know, you could maybe spin it and be a free hit week, but unless you've already used some of your chips, um it's unlikely to be a triple captain week, but if you have used some of your chips or you are going to kind of splurge a few of them early, which want to go on record and say I don't recommend, um then gameweek 33 could in that those unique circumstances be a be a triple captain opportunity, but want to try and avoid it really. Gameweek 36 is the next opportunity and I think it looks reasonably likely that uh Man City will have a double gameweek there. As long as Man City reach the or or Burnley, Man City or Burnley, if one of those two teams reaches the FA Cup semi-final, it looks pretty likely that Man City will have a second double gameweek in gameweek 36. And that would be your prime candidate for a second opportunity uh for the triple captain. So it would be in gameweek 36 it would be Brent it would be Man City against Brenford at home and either Crystal Palace at home or Burnley away. I'm really stuck between which one it will be and I guess it depends on some other things that that happen over the next kind of few weeks maybe even week uh because we've got FA Cup games this weekend which is going to really help to narrow things down but that doesn't help us right now when we're trying to when we're hovering over the triple captain button right now. um you know whatever happens this weekend is not useful to us. So realistic expectations gameweek 36 um there are is some potential for a gameweek 37 double gameweek some niche scenarios but it is still so open in that regard so many things need to happen in a certain way in cup um European games in FA Cup games certain teams need to go through etc etc that I don't really think it's worth talking about too much and even so I still think there's a good chance that fixtures just move into gameweek 26. So, in short, what are the alternative triple captain weeks aside from gameweek 26? You could do gameweek 33, but I would rather use a different ship there. A different ship would be far more powerful there. In gameweek 36 looks like the next best opportunity in terms of single game weeks, there's not really much going on to be honest. Um, not really seeing a particular week that stands out for Harland, for example. Um, you know, there's there's is there anything for Bruno? Not really. Leads at home in 32 maybe if you're not wild card in 32 if as a single game week. I don't know. I don't know, man. Not really seeing single game week opportunities to be honest. So, uh, yeah, I'm going to I'm going to basically say triple captain now. The next opportunity is probably going to be game 86. So, there we go. Um, hopefully that helps. Um, but, you know, if it helps, I'm triple captioning now because there's just too many variables for gameweek 36. The double is not guaranteed. It's just the most likely this it's just the second most uh likely opportunity after gameweek 26. Um because I think gaming 33 is a is a non- opportunity. I think it's a hindrance. I don't know. Maybe that helps. Maybe that helps. Uh Chris says, \"Rice and vanventa, Timbar, Triple Captain, and Sar.\" No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Um you Yeah, Rice is fine. Can we not just move Vanerven in this, you know, just one transfer for Vaneran to know Richards Manurs Hill, Sessi, someone like that? That's probably what I would do. I mean, unless you really really want to triple captain Timber, but if you've got Gabrielle and you've got Rice, I'm not as keen on Rice really, but if you've got Gabrielle and you want to triple captain him, then I think that's probably the move. Abdul says minus four to replace Kat Lewin with Mane from Wolves. No, don't think I'd do it. I think honestly Mane probably gets a four-pointer this weekend. This this game week and best scenario really for Mane is like a seven pointer maybe if he can manage an assist. Maybe a little speculative. Rei says Timberle captain. Have I lost it entirely? It's up to you. Do you do you like Timber Gabrielle is the question. Um I don't. I don't. I prefer Gabrielle, but you know there's nobody's saying that Timber is a bad pick. Nobody's saying Timber is a bad pick. He's just a different pick to Gabrielle. Gabrielle ultimately has been the you know primary primary goal scorer out of the defenders are the best defconer the most nailed on for minutes and there's and there's just so and and bonus points does well for bonus points doesn't really get yellow cards. There's just so many points in the favor of Gabrielle versus Timber. What Timber does have is slightly better underlying numbers and maybe slightly better open play positioning or much better open play positioning, but he's so far not really managed to convert that because I don't think he's a particularly good finisher necessarily. Um, so there are more points in the favor of of Gabrielle Gabrielle, but Timber is still a good pick. If you genuinely prefer Timber to Gabrielle or indeed you don't have Gabrielle, um then you definitely could too. Definitely could. Sean says, \"Dan, which one will you bench? Uh Mane, Pedro, or Enzo?\" Well, you're definitely not going to bench uh Pedro or Enzo. So, you got to bench Man\u00e9. You can't bench your Chelsea players this week, unfortunately. Leads at home. It's uh the fixture is too good. Uh, Javy says, \"Play Tarovski or Mane or transfer to Minor.\" H um, what would I do there? Probably transfer to Menurs. I'd probably transfer to Minor if I'm honest. But that is a little luxury of a move. There's a little luxury. Stuart asks about news on Sacka. None. Unfortunately, the Arsenal press conference is not until after the FPL deadline, so we won't get an update there, unfortunately. Would you take a hit to sell Tarovski and get? No. No, I wouldn't. Burma injured. Um, I think he's going to be fine. I think he's going to be fine. He's trained. So, are you doing Shouted Riches before deadline? I am indeed. I haven't done it yet. Um to be honest, um I was waiting for Crystal Palace press conference, but that's all done now. Um and it looks like it's the same players are going to be available from last week to this new gameweek. Um the only thing I was kind of w wondering about is is Brenford and Collins. I don't actually know when the Brenford press conference is. Was it yesterday? Does anyone know when the press when the Brenford press conference was? I'm not sure. Or is it not happening until after the deadline? I've not seen any notes anywhere though and I'm not seeing it come up my usual feeds today unless it's unless it's this afternoon. That's the only other thing. Uh, right. What else we got here? Uh, I'm not in the habit of watching Everton games. Where has this Tarovski falloff come from? I mean, I think maybe a a slight switch in tactics um has meant that Tarovski is getting less defensive contributions and we've seen that last couple of game weeks with kind of more center backs on the pitch kind of thing. Um, but I think the main thing is the clean sheets have dried up, right? And with Everton, they were a team and you know this is something that we we kind have spoken about in videos. Um Everton have not looked good defensively for quite some time now. And you know they've been quite fortunate in a lot of the clean sheets that they they were kind of keeping um a few weeks back I suppose now when now that the kind of um the luck has or the good fortune has dried up. Well, we're back to normal and they're conceding goals in situations where yeah, they're kind of expected to concede goals. They're conceding a lot of chances. Of course, they're going to concede goals. It was strange when they weren't conceding goals. And now things are kind of getting back to normal. So, I don't think it's a falloff, but more so things are just regressing to mean a little bit and looking a bit a little bit more how we would expect from a kind of data perspective. So yeah, Everton just not that good of a defense and now it's kind of showing unfortunately. Do I just need to make this transfer now so people stop asking me about when I'm why I haven't done ciao to riches and what I'm doing there? I just wanted to just wait and see if there's there's um anything on Collins. Is there anything? Let's just Google it. Brenford Press conference. Right. When is the next one? Um, there's none available to look at right now. I don't know. I don't know. There we go. Tim, I only answer this question if you put in as a super chat. Uh, hi mate. Tim here is is top 10k ranked good. Triple captain Gabrielle. Good luck on your triple captain Gabrielle. Tim has been top 10k every week for his entire FPL career. Apparently, he's an impressive run in the top 10k. I wonder if he'll ever push on to some higher ranks or just kind of stay around top 10k. Have to wait and see. We'll have to wait and see. VJ with the super chat here says Rya Timber, Taroski, Richards, Anderson, Muki, Bruno Wilson, Rice, Enzo, Chucky, Harland, Watkins, Guers, 3 million in the bank. Shall I remove Cherokee, Taroski or Watkins or Ro maybe bring in Hill Rogers, Echk? I mean, I wouldn't sell Rock Watkins. I think he's fine to keep and indeed play uh this game week. Um, what you may be looking at, you may be looking at Cherokee to someone. Turkey to Vert. Turkey tombmo. Turkey to Sar. I think that's probably what I'd do. Or Turkey to Rogers. You mentioned Rogers as a player you like as well. Um, yeah. I I don't I don't know which which player you prefer out of those, but I think yeah, Churkey would be the move I would make out of those. And that should really help to improve your midfield there. I think Turkey is just just frustrating, isn't he? Just a frustrating FBO asset. And look, there's every chance he starts against Fulham and and scores and whatever, but like is it worth the risk? Is it worth the stress? Is it worth the drama every single game week? Probably not, right? So, I think that's what I would do. Just get it done. Get a player you're confident in and move on. Um, I'd be less keen to bring in Minos or someone like that because you already have Richards. could go for Hill potentially if you want to as well or Sessi. Um maybe save some money to upgrade Gu even to Thiago next game week. That's what I'm looking to do next week maybe or maybe the week after, but probably next week I'm going to be doing Chidowobi to Thiago. Looking forward to that one. So there you go. Those are some suggestions. Belinda says, \"Hey, Thiago versus Anderson. Uh, I'm as an Arsenal lover, um, I'm going to go Anderson over Thiago this week. The only, um, kind of reason to maybe go for Thiago is to kind of hedge against your Arsenal defenders and kind of treat it as a, you know, a win-win scenario. That doesn't really work like that necessarily. So, there we go. Um, I would play Anderson, but yeah, could hedge. Could potentially hedge, right? What else we got here? Uh, bench list. We'll do bench list um at the hour mark. So, we'll start that off at 5. I like to start the bench list an hour before uh deadline just to just so we can uh do whatever else we need to do first. Um, triple captain Rice thoughts. I mean, it's not something I would do. If I didn't have Gabrielle, the triple captain, I would probably just save my triple captain. If it's me, if it's my team, at least. So, there we go. Um, right. Uh, let's do some members team ratings. Now, I can't promise I'm going to do all of them, to be honest, because, uh, yeah, tight deadlines, deadline stream. We'll do our best. We'll do we'll do a few. Um this was uh this is coming this morning. What's the what's the note here? Trying to mimic your team as much as possible. Don't I'm going to go ahead and say don't try and do that necessarily. Um I I one it's not fun um to copy you know someone else's team but uh also you shouldn't tie your your value to mine. You want to go for your own achievements, right? Um but yeah, sacker to rice seems obvious. So yeah, that does help get your team more towards mine. Um yeah, how many free transfer did you say? I don't know how if you miss last deadline I guess you have two free transfers. So Saka Rice Bow into I'd probably do Vitz or Rogers. Um you could do Burma as well if you really did want to get your team close to mine. Um yeah, something like that. Something like that. again that that probably just brings your team closer to mine to be honest. Um but yeah, that's what I would do. Saka Foden, those are your priority transfers out. Chiao could could probably go as well. Um Thiago, if you can create a scenario where you bench Thiago, good, but I don't think that's going to be possible depending on how many transfers you have. Super chat from Sid Vicious have 3.3 million by Manurs for Van Heeka or Tarovski. uh Tarovski I think just cuz you save yourself a bit of money and if Van Hecka's back or if he can return then it's not a bad fixture this week right so who are Brighton playing they're playing never look at Brighton fixtures because I just have zero interest in them uh for my own FPL team away okay yeah maybe not um it was last week they had the nice fixture wasn't Uh so right this is K's team my Everton players need to go soon even with Bourne for home I will be benching one and giant given their fixtures uh a short-term ple or SARS tempting not both I would then get Hill or Anderson or some some of the other guys in gameweek 27 for the other Everton players give me six transfers left gameweek 31 to need to get needing four to get a playing 11 I have exact money to swap my Everton duo to Hill and Burmo or could get vert instead. Um, third option is to do gear to Thiago and game 27. Finding out would mean I get Hill and Jupiter Hall or Anderson. If Daros, I'll probably roll on 26 and do 27. Uh, yeah, I think getting you up to a Thiago is probably your priority. Maybe just cuz it solves an issue in gaming 31. So maybe I would prepare to do that. I mean, this team ultimately doesn't really need any transfers. So I wouldn't rush them in. You mean you've got Laqua, so I don't think you really need Munoz and Saw. Um, you say you got a Bench and Everton player. Maybe make that Tarovski and play in Jai. That's probably what I would do. Yeah, this team this team is a roll. Reevaluate next week. Got Scott's team here. Um, who likes to look at the team? Just wondering what goalkeeper to start really. Um, would I would I play would I play Dravkar over Bugen? I don't know that I would, you know. It's tight, isn't it? Um, I guess. Okay. I guess maybe it would, but it be it would be really close. That's a toin cost kind of scenario, isn't it? Um, okay. Yeah. Play to Braval Carro Bugum only because it's only Sar in the Crystal Palace attack that's doing anything right now. Yep. Rest of the team looks good. Good to go. I mean, if you got your triple up on Arsenal, you're pretty much good to go. Mafon says, \"You've convinced me to triple captain.\" Gabrielle, thinking of rolling um or making a goalkeeper transfer. Don't think you really need a goalkeeper transfer. You can just play to Bravka this week. Um yeah, aside from that, team looks strong. Yeah, I don't think this needs a transfer. Team's in a good shape. No, no changes other than swap goalkeepers to Bravkar on roughs on the bench. Although saying that, saying that Sunderland are pretty good at home. Nah, surely not. It's Liverpool. Come on, let's be sensible here. Let's think smart. All right, Ali's team. And we got a super chat whilst uh whilst we just wait there. Uh from EAC who says, \"Thanks for an amazing YouTube. How many minutes do you think Mawa gets between both Arsenal games? I have him, Timber Gabrielle, one transfer, 0.3 million. Um, honest answer, think you do well to get 120 minutes. I think that would be a success if you get 120 minutes from him. Um, I'm not totally convinced, but you know, you just got to hope during those minutes he does he does do something or whether that's a corner taken that's kind of knocked in by hopefully Gabrielle. Um, I don't know. Um, but yeah, it's it's he's fine. Yeah, I think if you already have Madek, I wouldn't be looking to move him out, but not I don't know. Maybe maybe it's my own kind of profile of FPL asset I like to own, but Madd is not ideal. the the the big problem with Mekke is if Saka returns a little bit sooner than expected. If Saka's back for the second game in the double game week, then Mawke is being is going to be in uh big big trouble. Um but there's every chance that you know even if Saka's not back, we see one game where Arsenal play kind of Trosard and Martinelli on each wing or you know maybe someone else out out wide and that's the difficulty with Mawa. You just don't know. And the fact that the second game is so far away, the fact that even the first game is a couple of days away and there's been no press conference, it's very very difficult to come up with an accurate prediction, I suppose. So there we go. Matias says, \"Dan, thanks for the suggestions. If I do Saka to Rise and Foden tomb and burn, I still have 2 million left.\" It's not necessarily a bad thing. Definitely not a bad thing. No, I've got How much money have I got in the bank? I think after I make my I think I have 3.8 8 million in my bank after I make the child transfer, which is yeah, 3.8 million, which is loads, but it's fine. I want to have money in the bank because I want to upgrade Obi. I want to swap Rice out. I want to swap Enzo out. Um, I might even have to swap Collins out at some point as well. So there's um there's plenty of things in the future that we can be spending our saved money on. Right. So do we do team um three free transfers and four in the bank? This team, what does it need? It needs needs a tavern transfer, doesn't it? It needs a tavern upgrade. I'll do Tava tomb and Burmo Vertz or Rogers. One of those guys. That's what I would do, I think. Or you can go for another cheap if you if you fancy upgrading Obi to Thiago next game week. You could also just do Taer to a to a S. Maybe someone a bit more similarly priced to help fund the Obi upgrade. Or, you know, you go even cheaper. You go Anderson, you go Jbury Hall, something like that. All of them would work, I think. But ideally, you would buy someone to replace Anderson this week to allow you to bench Malik Chow this week, but I wouldn't use three transfers. I'd just use one this week. I think I'd probably play, would I play Wilson? I probably would play Wilson. Man City can be got at Trash Panda says I need to get a third Arsenal player. How are we going to do that then? Um, I think I'd just do pick for Terraa to be honest. You don't need double um or or Tarovski to to Timber. One or one of those. I think that's pretty straightforward. You don't need double Everton defense anymore. Um, at all really. What would I lean towards? Um, is Gabriel Chalaba, Nunz all playable this week? Okay, if you were to do Tarovski to Timber that would allow you a pretty nice four 42 and you can bench Wilson and Thiago if you wanted to. Alternatively, is the is it the better idea to actually just because you've got quite a strong attack, is it better to go picky? That would allow you to hide Rya in gameweek 31 on the blank gameweek. Maybe that's what I'll do. Write on the notes, but I'm really leaning towards Alder to Manurs and Jar Pedro to have there is no way I would sell Jar Pedro over the next two game weeks. Not a chance. Um now leadeds and Burnley I would I'm thinking about you know those people who will be captaining Jah Pedro in gameweek 27. So definitely wouldn't be doing that if you I mean look listen if you really really do want Havs in your in your team then I can't stop you. But um no it's not something I would even nearly consider if if this were my team. Um an Alderi to Mos. Do you need it? Do you need to have all five of your defenders cost over 5.4 million? It's too much money in defense considering the the wealth of cheap defenders right now. So, I don't think I would do that either. Um, yeah, I think if it's my team, I'm probably doing pick for Terra, but I also like Tarovski to Timber. And that's pretty much as far as I would go there. I'd save the extra transfer. I'd roll it on and that's pretty much what I would do. Yeah, but if you really want to do Pedro to have it, I can't stop you. Jessel says, \"Child to Hill. Any other suggestions?\" Um, I do like that. I mean, you could just go Richards. Chow to Richards maybe or mining to someone. May to star. If this is my team, what am I actually realistically doing here? I'm playing Rya. I'm playing Gabrielle O'Reilly, Kenate. I'm benching Chia Mukulele. Um, uh, yeah. Yeah, if this is my team, I'm probably doing Mayu Tasar. That's what I would do if it was my team. I don't know if that's the answer. You're probably not the answer you wanted to hear because every week you you have Minho on your team and every week I suggest some replacements for him. Um, and he's and yes, he's still here. So maybe there is an attachment there, but I can only tell you what I would do if it were my team. TomTom says, \"Wilson against Man City or Croo Jun against Everton?\" I think I'd play Wilson if it were my team. Yeah, I do Wilson. Play Thiago or Obie? It's a lose-lose. I don't know. Obie's going to get zero points. Thiago is going to get at least two. It's not bad. Could be a lot worse. Um, hey, I have Ekki on the bench. Who do I drop for him, Samuel or Pedro? No one. You keep Ekit on the bench. We're going to do a bench list fairly soon. So, um, hopefully we'll cover a lot of bench related questions. Um, we have I believe we've done all of our rate my teams. If there's any other members in the uh in the chat who do want a team rating, please do feel free to go ahead and uh if you want to join as a member as well, um you absolutely can do. Um joining as a member gives you access to a whole bunch of stuff. For example, the 100 experts video that was that went up this morning was actually available to members from like last night. Um, I didn't want to upload them publicly to no I didn't want to upload that video publicly too soon after the team selection video. So, I delayed it till this morning for everyone, but members typically will watch the video regardless. And, uh, therefore, I just put it up for members early. So, you're going to get early videos sometimes. Um, member streams, we do that most game weeks unless there's midweek games, which makes things difficult. Get access to the my planning uh, sheets as well. go join the private mini league and uh yeah, loads of other stuff. So, if you do want to join as a member, you can get your team rated straight away from today. And uh yes, but uh yeah, that's uh that's going to be at the starting 11 tier or above. And members, if you do drop your team in the uh the Google Drive, let me know. Let me know you've done it. Um flag it to me so I can have a look. Right. Anyway, back to business. I don't know what happened there. We had a bit of a lag on the transition, but Patrick says Columbus Cheese Heads and Jai and Stack out. Stack and Rogers in. Patrick, what does this mean, my friend? And Ji and Stack out. Stack and Rogers in. H Scott, yes you can. Yes, you can, my friend. Um, still trying to work out why there's two stacks. It's got to be It's got to mean someone else, right? Maybe someone cheaper. Who's real? Patrick, let me know. Uh, any wild card draft you can suggest? Yes. My advice on the wild card is to not use it. To be totally honest with you, I'd rather take like a minus eight than use a wild card. Oh, Anderson and Rogers. Oh, yeah. Okay. Um, yeah. Yeah, why not? If you want to. I don't think I, you know, I wouldn't do those moves for a hit. Um, I don't feel very particularly strongly about those moves. It's not something I'd be desperate to do necessarily, but yeah, if you prefer Anderson and Rogers, then absolutely go for it. Absolutely go for it. Uh, high, would you play DCL over Chaliba if you had them? Um, DCL is potentially ill, but no, I would play Chalibur. I play Chalibur. Timber to hill to fund over to Thiago and rice to V. Yeah, I like it. I like it for free. I like it. And it definitely improves your team, doesn't it? And it also helps you for game 31 as well. A lot actually. Cool. There we go. Zacharias says I added Richards uh on what's really first in the mini league uh as Mos or maybe for O'Reilly. I hate I don't have Villa or Palace attacker. Nah, it's not worth selling on Burmore or Enzo. Super chat from Trash Panda says first. Thank you your work and streams. They keep me saying it work. Good to know. Good to know. Also, I really want Minos. If not Aldereti, who would you kick out of my team from Chaloba Tarovski or Matas Nunes? I guess Tarovski, but like your priority is getting your triple Arsenal, right? Triple Arsenal is the priority. You could always if you wanted you to two do two transfers. Easy for me to say. Um, you could always do Tarovski to Mos and pick Vera. You can always do that. Yeah. But if you, you know, out of your defenders, your many many plethora of expensive defenders, Tarovski would be the first to go for me. But as triple up on Arsenal is the priority. That's like for everyone for everyone. Uh, Summit or Nothing says, \"Damn, what's the best free hit team this week? Haven't uh really seen it. Love the channel. Gets me through cardio at the gym.\" Good to hear, my friend. Good to hear. Um, however, I really, really would not recommend a free hit this week. I really wouldn't. Um, there's going to be so many better opportunities to use it. Um, there really is. So, yeah, this would probably be like, I don't know, something like the eighth best week to triple cap, uh, sorry, to free hit or something like that. It can't be worth it surely, unless your team just wasn't set up for this week at all. Um, so yeah, the best free hit is to not free hit. Um, the second best is triple up on Arsenal, triple up on Crystal Palace. Uh, probably at least two Man United, one or two Chelsea, and that would pretty much do you. Oh, and some Man City. You'd have a little bit of Man City in there as well. Probably Harland, maybe more. Not sure. Not sure, but something like that. FPL Vince, by the way, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel. Feel free to upload your team into the Google Drive, which can be found on my channel homepage, but only members at the starting 11 tier or above will be able to see that um that drive link and then you can just upload a screenshot of your team in there. Uh, hey Dan, what cheap defenders would you recommend? Um, Richard and Hill pretty much. Riches is 4.4, Hill is 3.9. I like both of them. Um, kind of backed up by the fact that I have both of them or at least will have both of them by the time we hit the deadline today. Bench list coming in 20 minutes. one sp with the 22 cent super chat. Uh, thank you very much for that. Um, I'll no message attached. I think there is a minimum spend to add a a message to chats. That is not enforced by me. That is enforced by YouTube. So, apologies for that. But I appreciate it regardless. I do appreciate that. Uh, should we see if there's any other rate my teams? No, there's not. That's fine. Keep it there. Just in case I'm going to need a new need a new orange squash in a minute. Joe's got the triple captain activated. 500% clean sheet coverage. Wait, so you're triple Arsenal defense, triple captain, Gabrielle. Oh my word. Remarkable. Remarkable. Would you buy a Strand Lson instead of Q if you had free transfers instead of the wild card? Um, it wouldn't impact me the wild cards. Uh, if you have free transfers, that is impactful though. Um, would I buy Shan Lson? Um, maybe we need to see. Well, I kind of want to see something from him. I guess the best time to buy is when the fixtures are good. It's a shame that he hasn't really shown much for Palace so far. Not that he's really had it very much time to do so. Um, yeah, man. It's it's it's it's a tough buy. You could do you could do I wouldn't I wouldn't rule it out. Um, if you're keen and if you do want to get that that additional forward in your team, then yeah, also depends who you're selling, right? Captain Yarez, is it a bad idea on a free hit? I don't I think captaining Yarez is a risky idea. We'll put it that way. I mean, going through the polls so far, 63% of you are triple captaining Gabrielle. 6% of you are triple captaining Rice. 4% of you are triple captaining someone else. And only 26% of you guys are not using the triple captain ship this week, which I find a little bit mad. Is it really that little? Are we really that heavy on triple captain this week? I didn't think it would be this heavy on Triple Captain to be honest. Unless some people are misreading the uh the uh question, the poll question. Thoughts on transferring Vanderventan out for Richards? Yep. Like it. Like it. Rice for Rogers. Uh I already have Ray and Gabrielle. H I don't love it. I don't love it to be fair. I'd be looking to remove a player I didn't want to have long term. And I think Rogers is a player I'd want to have long long term. Ross says bench Hill or Thiago. The Arsenal fan in me says bench Thiago. Hill has the higher ceiling. I think there's a good chance Hill conceds, but you know, Defcon is always um a possibility there. Four pointer, whereas Thiago, we're probably going to get a two-pointer if we're honest. Treble captain this week, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Too uh many things could prevent a better option later. Agreed, Carl. Absolutely agreed. which is exactly why I'm going to be triple captaining Gabrielle this game week. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Play Vert or Gayhee. Oh, that's a tough one. I guess you got to play Vert, right? I need to ask my wife if she wouldn't mind grabbing me a drink, but I don't think she's home. Let's check. Let's track her location. Oh, yeah. She is nowhere near home. Anyway, where were we? Right. Uh, would you play Enzo or Rogers? Enzo. I think I heard someone talking about how Timber has a ceiling as a triple captain. I don't think uh Timber has a higher ceiling than Gabrielle because Timber doesn't get defensive contributions. So if you're saying that Timber and Gabrielle, even if you say they have similar, you know, goal threat, attacking potential, whatever, then Gabrielle's still more likely to get Defcon and therefore that improves the ceiling. Huan says, \"Will Yakarez play both games?\" Honest answer, don't know. Um, yeah, the the the second game, well, the first game is not for another couple of days. The second game is not for another week, and it's so difficult to say right now. There's there's going to be a game in between those two as well in the FA Cup. So, it's so hard to get a judgment on what will happen in the second game. If I had to guess, I'd say he starts one game and is maybe on the bench for the other. But if he, you know, if he plays well in the first game, gets another goal, why not why not why why can't he start the second game? So, I think there's a chance of both happening. Uh this is this and and this is the exact problem. This is why I'm just saying just pick three out of Rya, Gabrielle, Rice, Timber. Just pick three out of those four. You know what you're getting. You can feel confident. You can feel happy. Everything's great. Everyone else is has some kind of question mark that nobody can answer. Mal Arteta doesn't know if if he's going to start Yokarez in the second game of the double gameweek yet. Probably has a good idea for the first game and he probably will start for the second game. Yeah. If the man if if we're in a situation where the manager probably doesn't know if they a player is going to start in the second game or not, then what hope do we have as FPL managers really? which is why I just don't want to play that game personally. When will we know about the when the teams will uh blank in game day four? We will know. Um let me just find my chart. Uh no FPL double game calendar. So, I really like my calendar. So, we will find out for 100% by not until the game 32 deadline. Is that right? Yeah. Wait. Yes. Yeah. We'll find out for 100% who blanks in gameweek 34 and indeed who doubles in 33. not until after the gameweek 31 deadline and indeed after the international break. So you're looking at like this is going to be something like the 5th of April or something like that before we find out. So two months away before we find out who's going to be doubling in 33 and blanking in 34 at least. That's when we'll know for sure. We'll have a good idea. Well, we'll have a better idea by uh by this weekend. We'll have an even better idea than that by the gameweek 30 deadline and then we'll have that verified by the gameweek 32 deadline. So, lots of variable lots of variables in play still. Lots of variables in play. Uh, good afternoon, Dan. What are your thoughts on Wilson? Should I sell for Enzo? No. If I didn't have Enzo already, I wouldn't be buying him anymore. In fact, that pretty much goes for all Chelsea players. If you haven't already got them, it's maybe too late. Maybe. Unless you have a lot of transfers going at the moment and you can afford to move them in and out because any Chelsea player you're really only looking to keep for two game weeks and that's really is that worth a transfer? I don't know. The other thing is there's just with Enzo in particular, there's so many great midfield options. You don't have to go for one that only has two good fixtures when there are a bunch of others that have great fixtures all the way up until gameweek 31 inclusive. Salem says have two free transfers by Timber for Tarovski and Triple Arsenal defense or just Riceford and Jai. Uh, what will I do? Probably rice in forai to be honest. I don't do see anything more about fitness. Yeah, he's trained so I think that's a positive thing. Trained normally. So maybe it was just cramp or something um when he was spotted limping the other day. Rice or Zimbaby? Rice. Nob brainer. Hill or Chiao. Who to start? Hill. No. Rya. I have Rya. I like Rya. Is it worth using a wild card? No. I'd rather take a minus eight than use a wild card this game week. Although fingers crossed you won't need to take a minus eight. Rogers to Rice. or do I just go double Arsenal? Um, I would I would prioritize triple Arsenal. If if Rochester Rice is really genuinely the only way to resolve that that uh that Arsenal situation, then I guess that's what you do. I would look for another route though. Is free hit gameweek 31 a good idea? Not in my opinion, because gameweek 34 is going to be in theory a significantly bigger blank gameweek. So yeah, gameweek 34 is going to be problematic for a lot of FPL managers, I think. Um, and therefore, yeah, uh, you use your free hit in gameweek 31 or sorry, in 20, no, 31, right? Use your free hit in gameweek 31, you'll get to gameweek 34 and you'll probably regress it probably. Anyway, how do you find and buy hill so early? By the way, your process is crazy good for catching these cheap beasts. Thank you, my friend. I I kind of agree. Um, yeah, is I think one of my few strengths in in the game of FPL. Obviously, we can't get everything perfect, but something I feel like I do do okay with is uh yeah, identifying those cheaper FPL assets. Um really it's just keeping an eye on um well first of all I noticed he was playing which is always a good start. Uh I noticed he was playing every game. Um after that I was like okay this is interesting. Hang on. We'll just answer super chat. Scorpio says oh Riley and Sessi to Gabrielle and triple captain and heal for minus four. Is that really the only way? If it is then yes. If you're desperate to triple captain Gabrielle and that's the only way, then yes, do it, I guess. But it's an Essie to Hillfield sideways. Yeah, I just noticed he was playing um I checked his Defcon numbers. They were really, really good. I checked his um his player ratings on F Mob. They were really good. I checked then I checked press conference notes. um the manager Iola was praising him and you know it's sometimes it's just you see one thing and then that you think oh that's interesting let's you know let's deep dig it bit further and if you're convinced again then you dig a bit further if you're still convinced you dig further and then um and then it ended up really being me just being completely convinced by him. Um but that said look I think he is a good pick. I think he has good value for money, but I'm not going to deny the fact that picking up an assist, which is basically just a a regular pass to Ryan who ran up ran up the entire pitch and did scored a solo goal. That is a just luck really. And really gave me 25 was more like a four-point appeal, but still really good. Um, but yeah, another thing I noticed is his defcon is incredible, man. It's so so good. It's so good. It's better than Sessi. So, it was enough to convince me to go for him. Yeah, I guess the first step is seeing if a player is actually playing and then after that, okay, what are their defcon numbers like? That's always step two for me. When I notice a player looks interesting, check their defcon numbers. If they're strong and hills were really strong, then um then you could be on to something. Uh, CIA says, \"Hey, Dan, do you still have hope on Arsenal winning the league?\" Yeah, I mean, I think so. I think so. I don't see why not. Arsenal's uh league to lose really. So, I feel fairly confident there. Play Mane or Ryan. Oh, I'd maybe go for Mane because of the double game week and also because we are expecting some rotation from Bournemouth and that may come into play with Ryan. Not sure. Juan says, \"Love from India. Love the chip strategy video. Have been following you since gameweek 2. Upload um uh since gameweek 2. Upload on Spotify podcast please. Also, Bowen's echk or verts for a minus four.\" Uh no, I wouldn't take a minus four to remove Bowen. I'd rather just play Bowen to be honest than take a minus four. Um, upload to Spotify. People have asked me about uploading to Spotify before, but honestly, um I don't it's it's time consuming and I appreciate that a lot of you guys would enjoy it, but I'm not really sure how it benefits me or the channel because all it potentially does is siphon views away from YouTube to a place where I wouldn't be making money from the uploads And that obviously is important when doing this is literally my job. Um, so I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I mean maybe I'll go back on Spotify and do something, but I'm not I don't I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced. Maybe I need to speak to someone about it and how it all works. All or the other thing is with with Spotify is a lot of my videos are quite graphical based. Like always have graphics. I usually make graphics. Um you know I'm not a I'm not a slideshow FPL content creator. I'm making stuff all the time and animating things and all kinds. So um yeah, I just don't know if it's suited. But anyway, um wouldn't make the Bowen move. Uh at least not this week and not for minus four. David says, \"Is duel go to Richard's worth doing over starting Thiago?\" Yes. Yeah, I would do it. I would do it. Craig says, \"Gabrielle, Chaliba, Virgil Van Djke, Rodon, and Dorgu in my defense. Can't decide if I should sell Dorgu or roll again.\" Um, well, you can play Gabriel Chaliba Van Djk as long as your um as long as your uh attack is fine, I guess. Yeah, that would kind of be the the important factor there. If your attack is in good shape and you don't need to play a four at the back, then I think you could just stick with what you've got and just roll. But if you do feel feel you need an additional player then uh yeah Doo to Hill or Riches good work. Joe says, \"Love the graphics, Dan. One of the best visual storytellers in the FB space.\" Good to hear, Joe. Thank you very much. And Joe, I I also like your graphics as well. I like your your um micro animations. And I wish I knew how to do them better. I really do. Um because I am I think I'm good at Premiier Pro. I probably could do more on Premier Pro if I put more time into it, but I'm terrible at After Effects. So, a lot of the micro animations I just don't have the time nor energy to figure out. Um, and you do them really well, Joe. To an extent where I am jealous, where I'm jealous. And I wish I could include more stuff like that in my own videos. Um, because it's awesome. I love that kind of thing. But uh yeah, appreciate the uh the kind words regardless. Um Dominic uh thank you very much for coming for becoming a member of the channel. Absolute legend. Um if you want to upload your team for a rating, you can do so by uh going to my channel homepage, finding the Google Drive link, and uploading an image there. Beautiful stuff. Is it roughly know known which teams will have a double game at 36? The two most likely teams are Man City and Crystal Palace, but it's up in the air. But yeah, but those are the most likely teams. Could be some other teams as well. Could be no other teams. Could be no teams whatsoever potentially. We'll have to wait and see how many teams will be blanking uh approximately for game 34. Eight. Eight teams blanking. Benji says, \"Hill or Thiago?\" I'm sure Captain Gabrielle hoping Thiago blank. It's up to you. Do you want to hedge with Thiago and kind of try and play both sides that way you always come out on top or are you happy to go Hill? I would probably play Hill. I prefer to go all in, but uh I don't think there's a wrong answer there necessarily, and I think they'll probably they probably projected similar scores. I would go Hill though. Taster says, \"Bench one, Rogers, Nunez, Caliber, Anderson, Mane, Enzo.\" Is the answer Man\u00e9? It might It may well be. It's either Manet or Anderson, I think. Let's say one of them. Uh, it is officially 1 hour till deadline, by the way, guys. One, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel, my friend. Um, yeah, it's officially 1 hour till deadline, and that can only mean one thing. It means that we need to do a bench list. Oh, we've not done a bench list all day. We've not done one since the weekend. It's been way too long. We need one. B Sharp, thank you very much for the super sticker, my friend. Appreciate it. Mucho appreciate web app. I'm so curious to learn how that works. Interesting stuff, man. Maybe I could learn a thing or two from you, Joe, to be fair at this point. Uh Carl says up to eight teams blanketing in gameweek 34 for the uh semis unless if the semi-finalist play each other or other non Premier League teams get through. Yeah, exactly. Spot on, Carl. Spot on. Pop. Um, by the way, if you intended to include a message there, I will keep an eye out in this in the chat for any messages. So, don't don't worry about sending another super chat or anything like that. If you have a message, just put it in the chat as a normal chat and I will try and keep my eye out for it. Right, bench list. Bench list. Let's start it off. Is there any odds of cities doubling at 36? Um, the odds really are just the odds of Man City and Burnley's combined chances of getting to the FA Cup semi-finals and then also factoring in the Premier League doing some weird things, which is also very possible. And you have to then factor in uh European Cup stuff. It's hard to figure out, but it would be over 50% chance, well over 50% chance of I would say uh intuitively of City doubling in in gameweek 36. Well over it would be over 50%. Yeah. But there's also a scenario where Man City don't reach the FA Cup semi-finals and still double in 36. There's there's also that scenario, too. Um, but there we're just so early. There are just so many moving parts and I wish I could give you a more conclusive answer. I really wish I could, but there's so many variables and factors in play that need to be resolved before we can give a more accurate answer. And as each week goes by, we'll be able to get a more accurate answer. But I appreciate that that doesn't help you right now. And a lot of people need these answers right now, but they just don't exist sadly. Uni says, \"Are we trouble captain Gabriel or no?\" I mean, I am my friend. Um, kind of up to you. Alistister, thank you for the super sticker there as well. Uh P Sharp says, \"Cheers Dan Chaliba or Riches to start.\" Tough one. Let's um let's kick let's kick the bench list off with those guys, I guess. And I'm actually going to put Riches ahead of Chaloba. I'm actually going to put Riches ahead. Um Riches has slightly better clean sheet odds and is typically a slightly better defconer as well. So I think that leads me towards Riches over Chelan. I think leadeds are a decent team in attack. They are more than capable of scoring in any given game week. And Nicole says, \"Hi Dan, 73 points in game 25. Uploaded my team to drive.\" Nicole, you are you snuck in. Not really at the right moment because we were only doing the team ratings in the first hour. Um, but regardless, looking at your team, you already made your transfer, so it doesn't really look like you're looking for any advice anyway to be fair, my friend. And I think you look like you're good to go. So, uh, yes, good luck, Nicole. Good luck, my friend. Uh, Evok, uh, says uh, Cherokee or Ivo. No, that says Ivo. It doesn't say Evo. It says Ivo. says, \"Churkey for Rogers or Sar?\" If it's me, I'm going Saw. That's okay, Nicole. It's no problem. Um, yeah, I go for Saw as a Turkey replacement, personally, I think. Right. Anyway, bench list. Who's going on there? Who's going on there? Thiago's gone on apparently. I'm going to put him here. We're going to put Vugan and Dravka on because I know a few people have that very question. And I am going to marginally put Dra Da Dravka ahead of Vugan Vugan. Drafka Vrava Bugan Dugan Vravka Vdugan. Sorry, my my brain melted there trying to differentiate between names that don't look similar but are surprisingly difficult to say in tandem. Um, okay. Right. Mane is a big question this week, isn't he? I think I play him over the bugan to stean. We're talking about toen or the bugen or dravka. Um, O'Reilly. O'Reilly I put reasonably high this week. Would I put him above Chaliba? Probably not. But I think I put him above. It's that small rotation risk is going to drop O'Reilly down a little bit. But I think he's a reasonably decent pick. Defcon though. You know what? I'm going to drop him lower than Thiago. Uh, I will put play a player like Crooppy Jr. below though. I don't know if anyone asked for Crooppy Junior, but um if not, you can just tell me. Dan didn't ask. Nobody cares about Creepy Junior. And if so, I'll just throw him my hands up. Muki. Okay. Players like Alder, Muki, they're going lower. Not as low as someone like Collins. I would marginally put Chiao higher than these guys. marginally Sessi. I'm going to put Sessi and Hill together because I do think they are much of a muchness. And I'm going to put them here. Um, super chat from Jandre says, \"Hi Dan, I have one free transfer. Is Gu to Krooppy Jr. or Vanden Vandenberg to Sessi worth a transfer to start? Either of them had a Harry Wilson. Which one do you prefer if any? I mean, I'd be fine to play Harry Wilson for what it's worth. Um, due to creepy I wouldn't do personally. Vandenberg to Sessi. I would think about I but I would probably be more likely to do Vandenberg Vandenberg to Hill at this point. And if you already have Hill, then I wouldn't double up on the Bournemouth defense. The other option is to go for a Crystal Palace defender like Richards. And those are your options there. Oh, Cat Lewin hasn't traveled according to a lead in the no. Is that true? Hang on. Sorry. I am going to have to verify that. Uh what got Lu? The game's tonight, isn't it? Wait, no. Yeah, it is. Yeah, of course it is. Away from home. I don't know. I'm not seeing anything. Not seeing anything on Calum. It's on your forum. Um I don't know, man. It's not something I've seen before, so I can't just automatically trust it, unfortunately. 47 months, Jandre. Crazy stuff. You almost got You're almost on the 48th month badge. That's a long time. N8 the Great says, \"I have timber and rice. Should I use my one free transfer for XDK to Yarez? And if so, who should I captain? Is Yarez too bold? Triple captain? Yeah. Is there no way of getting Gabrielle and triple captioning him? Juan, please do not spam my friend. I will add Wilson in just one moment. Um, should I use should I use the one free transfer exas? Probably not. Probably not. Nate the Great. Um, I would try and get Gabrielle up. That is your priority. And I would, you know, if you only have one free transfer, I would probably even take a minus four to make it happen. So, if there's any defenders you don't like and maybe another player who you may have been thinking about transferring for a while. If you think you can improve your team using both of the two free transfers, including getting Gabrielle in, then that's what I would do personally. If you can't get Gabrielle in, if it was my personal team, I probably would just forego the triple captain entirely and wait for a future double gameweek. Wait to see what happens in gameweek 36. If you don't have Gabrielle, some argument to triple captain Timber. Um, I guess. Don't know, man. I don't know, man. So, Wilson Wilson needs to go here, doesn't it? Somewhere. I mean, like I said, I would be fairly willing to play Wilson. It wouldn't be top of my list, but you could play him if you wanted to. They're a worse place to play. Eat. I would play probably You got to play him above Mane, right? Something like this. Thoughts on Havits? Little risky for me, but uh I don't hate him as a pick to be fair. Emmanson and Bowen seem to be popular in the chat. Gandre says, \"Wife is anxiously shouting from the kitchen. Ask him if he would start RAL or Anderson.\" Got to love the women playing FPL. You got to love everyone playing FPL. Well, you got to love it indeed. Uh, why is she shouting? She she she got her own device. Hop on the stream. Ask me yourself, Mrs. uh Mrs. Jandre. Um, okay. So, Anderson or Ra? I feel like I'd probably play Anderson. And I think that's reasonably straightforward as well. Um, I'm going to put Anderson here on on the um on the bench list, but yeah, I would play him above. Um, there's another super chat here from Kash that says subs and sh replacements, please, Dan. Uh, okay. Could you do Sar and Hill? Freeing up a little bit of money actually for some future moves. Unless you already if unless you don't have Arsenal players in which case your your Arsenal guys are going to be your replacements but yeah assuming you have triple Arsenal already saw and Hill or you know you could if you can go up to like V or Burmo and Hill that would be an option there as well. Um you if you are not going for Sar I'd be more likely to go for someone like Richards or Mos as well. You could go a little cheaper in the midfielder position potentially there. So there you go. There are a whole bunch of options for you. All of which are great. Uh Yash says, \"Hey Dan, two free transfers. O'Reilly DCL to Minor Man worth it?\" Can you help me with stats for triple captain Rice? I'm not really sure what you're looking for stats wise. A rice is playing a little deeper at the moment, so he's probably not going to have as much attacking threat open play, but he's still on those set pieces, which is always helpful. Um, is O'Reilly and DL to Minor and Man\u00e9 worth it? I mean, I'm not massively keen on the Mane transfer generally to be honest. So, I think, you know, he's probably going to get four to seven points this game week. More likely four, maybe even three. and he just causes you a problem in gamewick 31. So I don't know man why man not tou cuz man's cheaper. That's the only reason really people are going for mane. I think Marley is on set pieces but obviously to t to better open open play threat and potential penalties as well. I'm not sure who's going to be the penalty taker. Um, next Alistister says, \"Uh, hey Dan, should I start Anderson versus Wolves over Mano double game week?\" Uh, they're both on the bench list, my friend. So, hopefully that helps. We'll uh we'll throw in Verts as well maybe. But in terms of O'Reilly and DCL to Munoz and Mane, I don't think I would do it with two free transfers. I don't think I would. If you need an extra player, I mean, you can play O'Reillyy's perfectly playable this week. Zanna, not keen. Not keen. Right. We said we were going to do Bowen. We said we were going to do someone else. Who escapes my brain right now? Who was it? Remind me guys who I was going to put on the on the sheet. Right. Bowen first of all which is a toughish game really against Man United and the underlying numbers have not been great. I'm going to put Bowen mean similar situation to to Thiago where probably not going to have much open play threat but does have penalties. So I think in that but is a better fixture like Manchester United is obviously particularly at home is an easier fixture. So in that sense I maybe bump Bowen here. Super chat from Linus says stuck between Gayhei and Chalaba Enzo and Burmo. Buying or playing? I think I'd play. Would I play Gay overcalibur? Maybe not. No, probably not to be fair. Would I? It's tight. I maybe put Gay here. That helps. And like there's just no way you bench surely. And no way you bench in Burma either. You got to play both. Oh, Evan Nilson. That was the other player I was going to put on. Thank you for the reminder. So, Evan Nilson away to Everton. Um, he's got to be better than Thiago and Bowen, right? So, and we think there is a good chance that Evan Nilson's on penalties. So, does something like that make sense? Is there a tiny bit of rotation risk for Evan Nelson? Maybe. Maybe. Why would Shahal Petro go on the bench list? Why would you bench Schwar Pedro? Surely not. Surely surely not. Right. Floren Verts. Going to put him in a similar situation to Echk to be honest. Um, who would I put above? I'm going to put Verts above. What am I? I'm going to put They're pretty much on par. I'm going to put Verts and Echk on par. Just expensive Liverpool attackers altogether. All together. All right. Should we do some goalkeepers? Maybe Kellaha. Uh I mean I think that's a pretty obvious bench. Don't know what other goalkeepers people typically have at the moment. Um Sanchez. I guess people have Sanchez. You're going to play him above most of these guys. Um through some of these goalkeepers. Um sure some people have some Oh, Cells is out by the way. Cells is unavailable. Uh Ruffs. All right. Yeah, Ruffs is probably going even lower still. Oh, sorry. Even some of the other guys. Not lower than Kell. All right, Tarovski, are you on Pikford as well? Okay, let's do let's wrap up the goalkeepers with Pigford. Jo S, you're obviously going to play unless you have Rya. Uh, so he doesn't really need to go on the bench list. To be fair, Rya doesn't need to go on the bench list either to be fair. I don't know why he's on there. Nobody's thinking about benching him. Um, but yeah, Pigford, uh, a home to Bournemouth. You're probably going like here compared to some of these other guys. So above Dravka, right? Let's go back to the outfield players. We'll put Tarovski on here somewhere. Probably lower than Tessen Hill. Lower than Thiago. Maybe lower than O'Reilly. Maybe similar to O'Reilly. I'm going to go here. Okay, Keen. I mean, Keen's minutes are of some concern still, so I'm going to put him even lower. Van Dyk Virgil. Um, he's going to go maybe here. Is that right? It doesn't feel right, does it? Still doesn't feel right. Okay, that feels better. Enzo Lefay. Yeah, you're just not going to play Enzo Lefay realistically. Actually, you're more likely to play him than Collins, but yeah, I'm happy with that. Cash. Pretty indifferent about cash as a FPL pick. Maybe here. Not really super keen. Garner. Garner. Ghana. Ghana. Pretty reliable pick. Garner. He's like Anderson Light, isn't he? um losing some set piece share though now that Jbury Hall is back which has impacted him. So let's put Garner I guess a little lower than Anderson. I'm going to put him here. Garn Rice or Celiba Captain? Definitely Rice over Ciba. Definitely Rice over Ca. Should we do a captain poll? Just not no triple captain. So, let's um end that and we'll do Sorry, we'll add Meguire. Sorry, I know a few people are asking about Meguire. We'll add him in and I'm going to run up another poll whilst we add some a few more players to the bench list. So, Maguire um I guess above Tarovski, something like this. Maybe higher. Is that harsh? Maybe above Wilson. Yeah. Hey, Sheps is here. Member for 60 months. If I'm not mistaken, that's five years. Incredible. Incredible stuff. Uh, thank you, Callum. Nice to see you in here, my friend. Um, right, new super chat. It's\u00a310 super chat. Thank you very much. Uh, Cmax Spud, sorry for so many questions. Start Keller or Vugan? Uh, Vugan. Um, which one to bench and Burma Munoz, Enzo Chaliba, JPL Rogers? I'm top 3K and got the triple captain on Rice. Would you do Gabriel instead? Any advice? Well, yeah, I would do the I would do R. Sorry, I would do Gabrielle instead. I am doing Gabrielle instead. I feel like Gabrielle has a higher ceiling. Um, so more potential for things to go very right, but also a higher floor as well. So just I think in every way um Gabrielle to me just seems a much better captain than Rice. Uh some people may disagree but we've spoken about that extensively uh throughout this week I guess. Um in terms of who to bench and Burma, Enzo Chalaba, Shah Pedro or Rogers. I guess I guess Chalaba is maybe the answer to that one. Um because I think Chelsea will probably concede to leads. So you're looking at a four-pointer from Chaloba, which is pretty decent still, but I think the other guys just have a higher ceiling. How how likely is O'Reilly to start? I think O'Reilly is first choice for Man City. I think that is to me pretty clear. But when you play for Man City, being first choice is not always the uh the entire uh set of conditions required to start games with Pep Roulette. Who do you think is on Pens if Yarez isn't on the pitch? It's not going to be Erdigard, is he? Because he's probably not going to play. Um Eza, maybe if he's on the pitch. Um man, that's hard. Um, okay. From recent memory of Arsenal penalty takers, it's been Saka, Yakarez, Erdigard. I'm trying to think prior to that, who have I seen take penalties? I think Eza could take one. He's taken them for Palace before. I think I think I have vague memories of Martineelli having taken a penalty for Arsenal. Um, Gabrielle Jesus has got to be in contention, I guess, if he's starting. I don't I can't see Havitz. See it? Uh did Tech Rice take a penalty. I don't know, man. I I just don't think I've ever seen Havs take a penalty for Arsenal. Gabriel and Pence would be nice, wouldn't it? Um I don't know. Let's Let's have a I'm going to have a look at um Hav's penalty record. Is that what you're angling for? You want Havs to be on penalties to give you extra justification to uh pick them up. Okay. So, uh Havz has taken penalties before, but never for Arsenal. Oh, wait. That's a lie. He's taken one penalty for Arsenal. Oh, of course he has. I remember this. This was when Havitz was kind of going through a bit of a goal drought. He hadn't been at Arsenal very long and they were trying to build up his confidence. They were already like 3-0 up. I believe Arsenal were like 3-0 up and Havs and Saka very graciously gave Sacka the penalty. That is the only penalty I remember Havs taken for Arsenal and it is by the looks of this record the only penalty Havs has ever taken for Arsenal. So yes, he has technically taken a penalty for Arsenal before, but the circumstances in which it happened do not lend itself to repeatability. Let's put it that way. So will he take penalties? Maybe. Maybe. He's taken them for Germany before. He's taken them for the odd one for Chelsea. He's taken a few when he was back when he was playing in Germany. Although that's like what, six, seven years ago now. Maybe maybe Habits takes a if everyone else is off the pitch, but it's uh how likely you'll be saying that is Ibrahim says own Timba uh and Omari Omari Hartinson. Uh so Timber and Omari to Sar sorry what's going on here? Own timber. Omari to Sar or heaven to Caiba or play Barry. Omari to Sar or heaven to Celiba. If you haven't tripled up on Arsenal yet, that's your priority. That's what you need to do first. So if going from Aiden he I'm presuming that's Aiden Heaven to Siba. If that is an option for you and your only way of getting a third Arsenal player, then I would absolutely do that. Z with a super chat here as well. Wilson to Vitz Enzo Rogers S or roll. I think I would roll. I know that's the boring answer. Um but honestly, I think that's what I would do because I think I quite like Wilson. The only exception to that is if you feel very strongly about Vertz, Rogers, or Saw. I would give Enzo a miss though, if I didn't already own him. I think the boat is close or the ship is close to sailing on that one. So, you haven't quite missed the boat, but yeah, you're getting closer. Ahmed says, \"Muno's in for Chiao. Already have Richards. I don't think I'd like to double up really. I'd prefer to go for a Bournemouth defender if you've already got Richards.\" Um, but you could you could still go for Minos. It's just I'm not super keen on the double up there. Uh and John Long says, \"Hello, mate. What about a goalkeeper for the next six gamew weeks? I'm a little sick of a burggainen.\" So trying to get him out and finally gain some points in the goalkeeper spot. Um six gameweek goalkeeper. I after this week I think Keller looks nice, but I'm guessing you're looking up until what? Uh game 32 wild card maybe. I think it would have to be Kellaha because the fixtures are good after this week. And you can always buy Kellaha or you know wait until next week to get Kellaha or if you do need to buy Kellaha this week, play to Bravka this week. Play your backup goalkeeper. So yeah, I guess Keller I guess Kella is the answer. It's just not a great It's just not a great jumping on point for Keller, is it? Shepsy, thank you very much for the 79 or $1 and zero cents as the case may be. Um, to let you know, Callum, uh, YouTube does not allow messages with super chats or super stickers as they're known below what is it like 1 pound50 or more. It is a YouTube thing. I did not implement that rule. So, I don't know if you intended to throw in some kind of message in there. Um, but that that is often the case. People will put in like less than the YouTube threshold for messages, hoping that the next box will give you the option to write a message. But there is no next box and clicking send just sends the money. But thank you though. We'll take it. We'll take it. You're most perfectly welcome, John Long. And thank you very much for the super chat indeed. And thank you everyone for the super chats today. They really do help out the channel, guys. You know, it makes up a big chunk of um my wage. Well, that failed heavily. Enjoy 1/8 of a point on me. Thank you very much, mate. I will. I truly will. You tried. But next time, you're going to have to you're going to have to pull pull out the big bucks. I'm going to have to see two quid on the table if you want to put in any messages in this stream or indeed any stream because that's just how it works. That's just how it works. All right. Um what we saying on bench list? Is there any players uh who you feel are missing? Any non-ifferial players? Because last time we had a problem. The over 60s were in the chat and they couldn't read the uh the bench list because I put too many names on there and it made the text too small. Have to wait for payday and then we'll send my profanity. Fair enough, mate. Um please don't say Oh, actually there might actually be an automatic filter so that you might you may end up failing again um if it filters out swear words and stuff. Uh but you're welcome to try it. Just please nothing that is likely to get my account banned. Let's just put it that way. Uh although I don't think that's very likely to happen because I've never made any offenses on this channel before. All right. Who is missing then? AI. There are a few people with a Jai. Yeah, I think he can go on. Hill is on there already. I'm not totally confident about putting um Calbertt Lewon on there just because I don't know his injury status. Uh Callum Sturgis with the super chat says Manne Richards and Laqua on the bench. Uh I've bench boosted. Well, good luck to you my friend. Really um holding out for that Burnley clean sheet there. Good luck. Good luck. Yeah, that's a lot of investment. I mean, I'm hoping for a for a nice Crystal Palace clean sheet as well against Burnley. Hopefully, it's uh hopefully it comes through. Um and good luck to you, my friend. And Jai, let's let's throw Jai in and then we'll get to that super chat from Luke. I would put Andai probably somewhere near here, right? Something like that. Okay, so Luke says, \"Can't get Rice. Would you uh would you would you recommend going for Esmart Martinelli?\" Definitely not Es Martinelli either because Trosard's available. Uh no, I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend going for either of those players because I don't trust either of their minutes. I think you'd do just as well with a single gameweek player um compared to Eza and Marceli. So no, I wouldn't. I'd find another way. May maybe that means tripling up in defense. Maybe it means taking a hit. Um, yeah, I think you're just going to have to find a different way, Luke. I mean, some people like Zuba Mendy, not this guy. Yarez, maybe. Could you do Yarez as your third Arsenal? Way too chill says, \"Can't get Gabrielle, triple captain Rice, Ray, or Timber?\" I think if it if it was me, I I would maybe do Timber if I had to triple captain this week. But honestly, if I couldn't triple captain Gabrielle this week for whatever reason, I would just save the triple captainship for a future gameweek. I don't think there's anyone else from this Arsenal side that gives me enough confidence. And if you can't do Gabrielle, I think that would be really the um the tiebreaker because I don't think it's a super obvious decision to triple captain this week. I think there are multiple ways of doing things. Um, and anyone who's saving their triple captainship, absolutely fine. You know, it could work out even better. So, therefore, if you took Gabrielle away from me, that's what I do. I just saved the triple captainship. Uh, Ib sir says, \"XTK or Sha Pedro moving forwards. I wild carded on gamer 24.\" So, so it depends what you mean by that. If you're buying new, I probably wouldn't buy either this game week. I think Shah Pedro, the time to buy is probably past, but if you fancy a two gameweek punt and you need someone right now, then I'll go for Joel Pedro. Eat, I don't think I'd buy him ahead of Sunderland. I kind of be on the fence about buying him against Forest because it's an away fixture. But certainly from gameweek, so basically gameweek 26 27, Joel Pedro is better. Game 28 onwards. Echk is better is the simple answer to that. It depends. Do you need something right now? Can you wait? Dan, your triple vice captain is is is rice just for security? But I think technically I prefer timber just because I want I always try and make sure my vice captain is someone who is kind of ultra low risk um kind of player. Ultra low risk. And I think rice is that. I wonder if I can persuade my my dear wife um to get me a drink. Um hello pretty and you make me a squash. Um my poor chat um need me to stay here and answer their questions. There we go. Right, Rogers on the bench list. Are we thinking benching Rogers? We're not surely. Um, I mean, he would go to the top of this list to be fair, so I don't think uh I'll do that. Is Timber guaranteed to start both games? No, he's not guaranteed to start both games. No. I mean, there's every chance he does, but I would give it, you know, there's got to be at least a 10 to 20% chance that he misses one of the two games. You would you would imagine. Um yeah. Oh yes. He's making this squash. Amazing news. Is there Did anyone find out if there's a Keith Andrews press conference? Is that not happening today? Poor assho. Oh, make tea. Yes, please. Yes, please. Right. You know what? I think I'm ready to make my transfers. In fact, I'll wait till my squash arrives and Oh, no. Wait till my tea arrives as well. more cheers in the new the new transfers with a new drink. That's what we need. Will it be an orange or a black current squash? That's the question. Wifey guest appearance. We'll have to see. We'll have to see. I if if I know her, she probably will not want to come in because she's too shy. But we'll see. She's not been on the FBM YouTube channel in years now. Too long. Too long. Right. Is Uber Mendy a bad option? I think bad is probably the wrong word. It's just an uninspiring option and probably is going to get you four or five points. That's that's harsh. Uh you could probably expect six or seven points. Elderflower squash nailed on. If my wife walks in with an elderflower squash, well, I'm glad we did a fresh wash of towels this week. I'll put it that way because she's going to need a few of them and probably to rewash her hair because that elderflower squash would be all over her. Would you play O'Brien or Cash? Um, I would play I don't know. I guess I guess O'Brien. Honestly, I'm I've got the elderflower squash in my head now. is if she comes in with the elderflower squash. Get out of here with that utter woke nonsense. Who's on pens for Walls? Great question. I wish I knew. I I think there's a good chance it's going to be Tou, but uh honestly I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. just joined King Gusto bench list. I think you got to play Gusto. He's he's looking good for minutes, I think, tonight because uh James is still a little a little risky. You can't do that to Morgan. She's too sweet. I absolutely can do that to Morgan if she that that is that is that is not sweet behavior at all. That is wind up merchant behavior. She she would know I would hate that as well. So, if she wants to wind me up, oh, we two can play that game. Playful banter. Will Ju Hall ever make the bench list? Do we really have to put There's There's a lot of begging for Ju Hall on the bench list. I suppose he'll have to go on, won't he? I just don't really know where to put him. I guess like next to Andai. In fact, let's just put him here. Then we don't take up any extra space. You've never wanted something to happen more. Well, let's find out. Let's find out what happens next. Captain Gabriel or Yukarus? Definitely Gabrielle. Oh, I said I was going to do another poll. We're not long until deadline now. All right. So, uh, this is not a triple captain question. This is just a general captain question. Who is your game week 26 captain? And we're going to put Gabrielle Rice. Who else? Timber or other? I think that pretty much covers it. Is there anyone else I'm missing? There. Is anyone seriously Hello. Come in. I'm putting the poll in. Are you actually making appearance on the FBM YouTube channel? or you sneaking in the corner, not even using any words. That was one of the sneakiest sneaks. Thank you for that. Bye. See you soon. Well, I can tell you it's not elderflower. You want to take Should we take bets on what what flavor the squash is? Get your bets in. Right. Um, what we missing? Petravvic. Petravvic. I wouldn't mind playing Petravvic this week to be fair. Vimto. Vile. Vile. Um, Petraich probably probably here. I don't know. Right. Well, if anyone answered black currant, you are exactly correct. Summer fruit in February. in February. Vile. That's worse than elderflower. Elderflower vinto and summer fruit. Say fruit and barley. Next. Fruit and bar. You know what the worst one is? Lemon. Has anyone ever had lemon squash before? It's uh Ridiculous. That's good squash. That is a good That is a good Asda's own black currant squash. Max says, \"I love lemon squash, mate. Come on, man.\" Mark likes it as well. You guys need to all give your heads a collective wobble because that is vile. Summer fruits all year round. How can you If you're having one drink all year round, how can you possibly enjoy it? Lemon is elite. Get cultured down. No, I'm sorry. Am I Am I in the Twilight Zone? What's going on, man? What's going on? Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Um, right. Well, I'm going to make some transfers. Well, a transfer. So, I'm going to flick the bench list off the screen for a momentto. And we're going to do ciao to riches. We're going to lock this one in. Um, even if the Collins situation uh looks grim there, we have got some time. I mean, I don't I wouldn't even have to play him in 27 if I didn't want to. Um, I need to know basically by gameweek 28, is he good or is he bad? Because I would really like to play him from gameweek 28 onwards. Really like to play him. But for now, we don't need him. So, we've got our good friend Ricardo Shep. Even you like lemon squash. Oh man, I can't believe it. It's so bad, man. It's so bad. Honestly, I was like stranded in the middle of the Sahara Desert and all I had was lemon squash. I'd say, \"Mate, I'd rather wait till the next oasis. Even if there's a crocodile in there waiting for me, I'd rather take my chances with some proper proper swamp water rather than some chemically grown lemon swamp water. Terrible. Terrible. I'll take my chances. Um, right. So, I think I'm pretty much locked in now with 15 minutes to go till deadline. Triple captain's active. I mean, I'm if I had Timber, I'd probably vice captain him, but I don't. So, um, Gabri, uh, Gabrielle triple captain. I'm I'm so set on that at this point. Rice on the vice. Rice on the vice. It rhymes. It's just right, isn't it? Uh, pint of lemon squash or triple captain EAC this week. Oh, well, I'd have to take the squash, wouldn't I? I'd have to take the squash. Damn. That That would At least nobody ever put me in that situation. So gross. Like I've literally tried to drink it before and like I can't physically swallow it. It's so horrible. It's so horrible. Brenford Wool 100% score. 100%. Stick your mortgage on it then, mate. Stick your mortgage on it. You're that certain. Uh, should I transfer Keen to anyone? No. Here. Uh, yeah, potentially if you've got like a Hill Sessie, Richards, Mos shaped hole in your team, then maybe one of those guys could work. Uh, Benjamin with a super chat says, \"Donnaruma or Pigford in goal?\" I think Donnaruma's your guy. Any leaks? Um, any leaks? I doubt it. To be fair, to be fair though. To be fair though, what what leaks are you looking for? Reese James or Anthony Gordon? I think a good chance Anthony Gordon could be in the squad by the way today. Um, I don't know if that impacts anyone in any way. Papu says Premier League server is down. I can't change my team now. Um, have you tried the app? And if you tried the app, have you tried the desktop? Um, try a different device is basically is basically my advice. Uh or yeah or um uh if you are on mobile and you only have access to a mobile, if it's not working on the mobile app, try your browser, your inapp browser. That's what I would recommend. Uh haven't got any news other than this. This is interesting. Cash not pictured in training apparently. We will see what happens there. Um, yeah, that's all I got. That's all I got. Start Tatty or Rogers? I'd start Rogers. Would you play Wilson over cash? Yeah. Uh, Ipsster says, \"Dan, what do you think uh of triple captain Harland versus Fulham or Petro versus Burnley?\" Um, nah. I I'd really be looking at triple captaining on a double gameweek. If you don't do it on an Arsenal player this week, then really we're waiting to see if if gameweek 35, 36, or 37 become a double gameweek. Um, all of which have a chance to become double gameweeks. Technically, gameweek 31 does as well. Uh, no, game week 31. Is that right? Gameweek 32. So, technically gameweek 32 also has a chance to be a double gameweek. Um, but pretty unlikely. So, we may get another double is pretty likely that we'll get another double gameweek this season. Um, if you're not using a triple captain on this gameweek, then do it on another. I live to watch you press the panic button a minute before the deadline. Is there a panic button? There's no panic button. I'm chilling. Honestly, sometimes I am panicking. Today is not one of those days. Today I'm chilling. Team saved. Team looks good. Everything's in order. Gabrielle's triple captained. In fact, maybe I'll scroll up a little bit just to make it very clear that triple captain is active. Man's active. Can't see the bench, but who cares? We trust in him, Big Gabby. We do indeed, Benjamin. We do. Uh Henry says, \"Dan, don't triple captain Gabrielle trust me on this.\" I'm sorry, Henry. Um I don't believe we've met before, and it takes me a little while to build up trust with new people. So, uh for that reason, I'm I'm going to have to go ahead and not trust you this week. Um well, let's work on our rapport and we'll see. Mark says, \"Sorry, Dan, but I'm hoping for Enzo to fail.\" Fair enough, Mark. Fair enough. I mean, I'm hoping Enzo will do very well. I don't know if it'll happen or not. Finding out Bruno is benchwood. Uh, press the panic button. Are they They're not playing until uh later, are they? No, they're playing 45 minutes later. So, I think the chances of us getting a leak there is pretty low. We don't typically get Man United leaks. Actually, that's a lie. We do sometimes. But I don't know. The the game isn't until what, like 8:30? No, 8:15. So, pretty late. You know what? I'm looking forward to a footy extravaganza tonight, though. I'm I'm ready. I'm ready to go back in for more FPL after this weekend. A nice a second Green Arrow in a row. I'm I feel like I'm on a roll. I'm ready to go again. I just cannot wait for Gabrielle on Thursday. It's going to be so much fun, man. I love the triple. Triple captain is the most overrated, overhyped chip in the entirety of FPL. And realistically, the swing you're going to get from a decent triple captain is like 10 points on the crowd. I mean, um, but it's just so much fun. And I I think that's the purpose of FPL, right? To be fun, just to add that extra little bit of jeopardy. It feels like it's more Jeopardy than it actually is. And I don't know, it just it it does it for me. It does it for me. Chess said, \"It's my birthday. As a birthday gift, can you please reply whom to play? Bowen against Man United at home or Wilson against Man City?\" I play Bowen. But by the way, I think I'd play Bowen at least. There's not much in it. I think I play Bowen because he's on penalties. By the way, if it's not actually your birthday, chess, and this is kind of the new meta for getting people to reply in the chat, then honestly, fair play. I won't let it work on me again. So, I'm sorry anyone else who it's birthday who birthday it is today. Uh I will not be falling for it again. But, you know, for the creativity of using the birthday meta to get a chat reply, honestly, fair bloody play. Fair bloody play. You've even got people in the chat saying happy birthday. Here we go. Oh, look. It seems to be a few other people's birthdays in the chat. Hy funny how that works, isn't it? Funny how that works. Play Wilson or Chela. I'd play Chela. I'll put the bench list on screen. We'll put it on. We'll leave it on there for a couple more minutes. I have to play Wilson and Bowen. Not ideal. David, I think it could be worse. I think it could be worse, my friend. Jude says, \"Genuinely, it is my birthday.\" And then follows with an FBO question. If you if you just said, \"Genuinely, it's my birthday,\" I would have said, \"Happy birthday.\" But because you followed it up with an FBO question, I just have to be suspicious now. And I just feel like I don't know. I don't I don't Maybe I'm being made a fool of. So, I'm sorry, Jude. Can't do it. It's my birthday. Can you drink some lemon squash? No. David wants \u00a310 because it's his birthday. I It's in the It's in the post in in your card, David. It'll arrive soon, I'm sure. Happy birthday to everyone in the chat. You know what? If it is your birthday today, if it you know what? Even if it isn't your birthday, happy birthday to everyone, regardless of if it's your birthday or not, because apparently it's arbitrary anyway. Who cares if it's your birthday? If it helps you get FBL questions answered, then um then it it could be. And who cares anyway? Just a random number. How many times the earth has revolved around the sun since the day you emerged from your mother, so who cares? Ryan says it's his wedding. You know what? Everyone wish me a happy birthday. Thank you guys. Thank you for everyone wishing me a happy birthday. It's everyone's birthday and yet nobody's um merry Christmas too. Why not? Happy Hanukkah. Happy Hanukkah. Uh and uh Eid Mabarak as well. Why not? Why not? Happy Pride Day. You know, happy Pride Day. Pride month. Is that Wait, it actually is Pride Month, isn't it? Okay. Happy not Pride month. I don't know. Happy Easter. Happy Pancake Day. Shrove Tuesday. It's my favorite day of the year. Oh, May Bank holiday. Wowers. Um, let's get back to FPL for the final five minutes before I lose my mind. Uh, it's because I've been streaming for too long. Uh, Momo Suzoko says, \"Hi, Dan. Two free transfers. Cash to Minos, Evan, to Evanson to Strand Larson, Anderson to Sar. Um, no, I don't think so. I wouldn't I don't think I'd bring in two Crystal Palace players. I just pick your poison. Uh, happy Black History Month. Happy uh Black History Month as well. That's the important one. That's the big one. Um I don't Yeah, I wouldn't do double crystal patch, but I think I could I certainly wouldn't do triple. If you had if you can afford to do cash to mono in one move, I would do it though. Evan Hilton to Strand Larsson and Anderson to Sar not really as keen on those moves. But cash to I I quite like if you can uh if you do that in one if not even even cash to to Richards is is pretty nice to me. He's pretty nice indeed. All right. Well, let's check. Let's keep an eye out for early team news. I'm hoping you guys are happy with bench list. If not, take a screenshot. It will last longer. And I will put my team on screen for the final few minutes of the stream just because the show team gang and not going to be happy otherwise. Going to be displeased at best. Let's take a screenshot of my FPL team as well before the uh deadline passes. 2 minutes till deadline, guys. Make sure we are locking in any final transfers, decisions, benchings, um triple captains. Is anyone still Is anyone here still on the fence for triple captain? Is anyone still not locked in? Marty O, I forgot how to say your surname. Om Mahoon Marty Mahoon says, \"Uh, here's some candy d'H.\" What on earth is candy dash? Is that Irish? Is that an Irish phrase? Here is some candy dash. Candy dash to be sure. Um, yeah, there are a few people in the chat. Oh, correct. It is an Irish uh term. Or yes, that's correct how I'm saying your name. Who knows? Who knows at this point? I need to write it down. Really, the pron pronunciation. Do'Sh. I know. I know. Do'Sh'ache is money. I've heard do'ach. Oh, it's sweets money. Oh, candy means sweets. Is that's like in America. Crazy. Weird. Um, okay. Well, some people some people locking in bench boost is crazy. It's dodged to my candy with gez. But I've never used the phrase candy. The only time I would ever use the word candy is if I'm singing 50 Cent songs, which doesn't happen very often. DCL or Rogers. Uh, Rogers. Kaisedo will score. Well, fair play. Shout out FPL crew. Dan, you make me laugh with the lemon squash bon anniversary. Thank you, Simon. And more. And yet still more people in the chat are still saying it's their birthday. Crazy candy floss. Oh yeah, sen backpacker. That's a good point. I would I would use the term candy if talking about candy floss. Uh right, literally 30 seconds till deadline, guys. So, um it is time to lock her in. Oh, that was a slurpy slurp. I need to go away from the This tea is not had a non I've not had a caffeinated cup of tea in a long time. At least two weeks. I was taking into consideration our American cousins. Oh, well that's your mistake. Right, guys? That is going to be locked. We're locked in. We're locked in, guys. The deadline has officially passed. Yes, indeed, guys. A midweek deadline. The first double gameweek of the season. We are ready to go. We are ready. I hope we're ready. At least I feel ready. And what's that? What's that I hear? Could it be? What could it be? Hello. Ah, okay. Okay. Right. I will pass the message on. I'll pass the message on. Sorry. It's It's Mikuel Artetta. Mikuel Artetta. Yes. Yes. MueL. Yes. Uhhuh. And we're still on for paddle on uh on Wednesday even though it's the day before the game. We're still on for paddle. We are fantastic, mate. Bring your own game. You're going to need it, my friend. All right. Adios, amigo. Bye-bye. Well, that was Mal Artetta ringing me to inform me that Gabrielle is is is going to haul this week. He's told me he's put he's put Gabrielle in charge of of of the of set pieces. Gabrielle is going to be on the end of every single one. None of this timber nonsense. None of this, you know, ball bounces out to for a second ball to Zuba Mendy or anything like that. We are going to be seeing a Gabrielle masterclass. Mikuel told me he he's told me it's happening. It's happening. So, uh yeah. Um I I would usually I'd say good luck to to Gabrielle, Triple Captain. You don't need it. You don't need it. Art has told me. He's told me. He's told me already. He's not going to put Gabrielle in the nine, though, which is disappointing. And he he he could not confirm nor deny whether Gabrielle would be on penalties either. Um but maybe he's teasing it. Maybe he's teasing it. Are we seeing a squash tier list? Well, considering I only drink two types of squash, orange or black currant, and I pretty much refuse to drink all others in uh my uh in a little stuck in my ways when it comes to squash. Uh I don't think there's much point. I would just put black currant and or black currant and orange in S tier. I'd put fruit and barley, summer fruits, apple and black currant in No, not apple and black currents elite actually. Um I'll put those in like D tier and then F tier would be like lemon and strawberry squash. Oh my word. I have had strawberry squash before. Vile. Absolutely vile. Orange and pineapple is like a sea tier. Why mess about with it? Shepsy says, \"Dan, it's my nan uh Eene Dover's birthday. She's 67 today. Could you give her a shout out?\" Well, Shepsy Shepsy Shepsy, let's figure this out for a second. You're 32 years old. So if your nan was 67, that means you you both your nan and your mom would have been teenagers when they had one another. And you I don't know if uh if that works mathematically um but in case in case it does uh happy birthday to Shepsy's nan do 67 today. Happy birthday. Um right. What else we got here? Thanks for the great channel, Dan. Sometimes I do wonder if it is a great channel. Sometimes I do wonder. Um, Los Hobbits says, \"Thanks, Dan. Have a great week and good luck with the trouble captain. Going to watch some anime now like real men do.\" What anime, Lost Hobbits, I need you to answer me that before you go. Uh, something backpacker says, \"So, basically the next charity stream, guess what the crowd want you to drink a pine of?\" Hey, look. If it's for charity, then this is different. This is different. There are a few things I would not do for charity. That's like there are so many things I wouldn't do for charity. I mean, look, I try and be a a nice guy, a generous guy where I can, but everyone has their limits. Uh, everyone has their limits. I watch you and FPL Tom, but all FL guys are cool. I I hopefully agree. Hopefully agree. I do still want to at some point try and attempt the longest ever FPL stream for charity. So maybe maybe that can be the one where we set various challenges such as drink flavors of squash that are quite frankly vile. Um, and maybe we could do we can set up a a series of oh what we could do we could do like a spinny wheel and every time we hit a ch like a charity money target we spin the wheel of forfeits and one of the forfeits can be like wear a Spurs football shirt for the next hour. One could be um like drink a pint of lemon squash just other vile things that I definitely don't want to do. We could do something like that. That could be fun. We could do something like that. We're talking about bird legs again, man. Uh, what else? We can do a watch along. I don't think I'll do a watch along. I think I'll just do like a like a dayong deadline stream. Like an ultra long deadline stream. Or unless you do unless you'd rather do like a watch along for like a a full days worth of football. Maybe Mark has sent a gifted membership into the chat, but who will be the one to receive it? It's Cravac. Congratulations, Cravac. And thank you very much to Mark for gifting a membership. Absolute legend. Sravac, make sure you say thank you. Uh, what else we got here? Uh, FC26 watch along. Does anyone really want to watch him play FC 26? I you know what? I don't even I don't even play Ultimate Team and I haven't done since like October. Honestly, I did not last long on Ultimate Team this year at all. In fact, I've got I've got a load of FC points just sitting on my account unused because I was like, I'm not enjoying this game enough to justify spending these FC points that I have already bought. So, I'm saving them. So, I'm just saving them for next year. What about lemon sorbet? Can't say I've ever had it. Maybe the start of next season you can do a full day stream up till deadline. The only problem with that is is I'm usually like crazy busy in the runup to the first deadline with a million different things. Um, plus like events and stuff as well. If I'm going to like FPL related events, which I often am at the start of the season, meetups and stuff, which I haven't been to an FPL meetup since since gameweek one deadline day. I need to go to another one, but I just don't know. I don't know when the dates are. I will go to I will go to some more FPL meetups soon. And if there's any around the country, I might may even go somewhere slightly different. Right. Uh, and we can get a selection of ideas for the wheel of uh, misfortune. Yeah, we we'll do some we'll do some uh, brainstorming. We'll do some brainstorming for that. I need to figure out when the stream is going to be first of all and what we'll do, whether it'll be like a really long deadline stream or like a watch. Dan, why did you leave Richardes in your starting 11? What do you mean? Why did I leave him there? It's where he's meant to be. He's right exactly where he's supposed to be in life. Congratulations to the young man. Um, yeah, Burnley at home. No brain. All right. Uh, Muhammad says, \"Are you a full-time YouTuber now?\" Yes, and I have been for what is it coming up? Five years. That doesn't seem right. How long have I been married? I actually need to work this out. When did I quit my job? I quit my day job in like June of or July July 2021 which means I will be I will have been five years as a full-time YouTuber as of July. Wow. How on earth am I going to reintegrate with the regular world after that? How on earth am I going to reintegrate into normal society? You guys are just going to have to keep watching my videos, I'm afraid. I am not going back to the offices. I'll tell you that right now. I'll make videos for nobody before I do that. And unfortunately, I'll have to become a burden on my family who will have to fund my lifestyle. Uh uh what we got here? Oh my god, mate. I'm so scared. Are we going to do well? Yeah, of course we are. Been watching you since the 201920 season. Gosh, time flies. That is a long time to be fair. A very long time. Uh, are you going to do lineups? Yes. Yeah, I'm waiting another four minutes for the lineups and we're going to go through them and have a little look. What was your full uh full uh wait, sorry, trying to read this again. What was your profession before doing this full-time? I was a really I don't know how to describe it because I did I had so many I worked for a small company and basically did a little bit of everything. Bit of admin, bit of web administration, bit of design, bit of customer service. bit of like um but like the the relevant stuff I guess was the um the user interface uh UI and UX design which I was doing and I guess just design work in general. I mean I've done design stuff at least freelance for 10 years. Um, so yeah, yeah, graphic design I've been doing free, well, not the last five years I haven't been because I've been doing YouTube, but but saying that, even when I first started the YouTube channel, I was doing a lot of freelance uh graphic design for bits and bobs. I did a lot for Fantasy Football Hub. Um, a lot of the stuff they still use the in in terms of the FPL community, the thing that I that as a designer rather than as a YouTuber that I pioneered as an FBL behind thes scenes designer is, you know, when you you watch podcasts and underneath, you know, FBL podcasts, right? I don't know if any of you guys watch any of them, but there's loads of them out there. And sometimes they will have like their name underneath them. So that their name would be like down here and it would say their rank and then a an arrow, a green or a red arrow going up or down. I was the first first person to add that in to any uh podcast, any uh any FPL podcast. I was the first person to add that that little arrow. Um, fun fact for you now. Everyone does it. Pioneer, my friends. Pioneer. Tiny little detail, but you everyone does it now. Everyone does it. But like to be fair, when I first started doing FPL stuff, the the the space was fairly barren. Like, you know, there wasn't a lot of people doing it, and those that were doing it weren't doing much. So, But yeah, the bench list 100 experts. Yeah, they're things that I started and then everyone a lot of people doing um bice void tier lists. Um generally speaking, whole bunch of stuff, but I think that's just because I've been around for so long at this point. I'm I'm I'm basically an old fogy when it comes to FPL content at this time, which is crazy to say. It's pretty crazy to say. We'll try and find some uh some uh lineups and stuff. We go to Let's go to Chelsea first. Chillshoot. Chillshoot. Chelsea. Clearly influenced the FPL community in many ways. I think I have. I think I have. I hope I have. I hope I've been a nice, you know, I hope my uh I have a a legacy that lives on when I'm done in the FPL community, which hopefully is not for a very very long time. If it does have to come to the end, hopefully I may I left a good mark that continues onwards and uh inspires the next generation of FPL content creators. That would be a nice way to end if it had to. But there we go. Thank you very much for the kind messages, guys. Computer stuff, basically. Yeah, that was my old job was computer stuff. He's the He's He does the computer stuff. That Dan works for us, does computer stuff, but I work for a company where everyone did computer stuff. So, so there you go. Right. Come on, Chelsea. Chelsea, FPL, Dan, you should be proud of yourself. what you're achieving is amazing. Thank you very much. I do appreciate. I really do. Still get imposter syndrome uh quite often, particularly Oh, I think F are tweeting the uh tweet stuff out. Are they tweeting stuff out? Maybe. Uh yeah, particularly with the last couple of seasons where my ranks have not been ideal, but um things can change fast. Please be here. Okay, Hill's here. Hill's here. Sessi's here. Ryan's here. Who's not here? Crooppy Junior on the bench. Okay, we have our first uh catastrophe uh of the gameweek 26 midweek gameweek. There's always bound to be a catastrophe or two. Fingers crossed not too many of you guys started Krooppy Jr., but he is on the bench. That's catastrophe number one. I will read out the Bournemouth starting lineup. We've got Petravic, Trafair, Sness, Scott, Evan Olson's, Christy, Jimenez, Adley, Hill, Tooff, and Ryan. Uh, I've got Newcastle next and Gordy Gordon's back. Pope, Trippia, Botman, Gordon, Barnes, Cow, Elanga, Willick, Burn, Bruno G, and Ramsey, which means Hall is on the bench. Does anyone have Hall? Maybe another disaster. Mark says, \"I should have waited till a bit uh waited a bit before gifting. Save for the people who stay to the end.\" Yeah, maybe Mark. Maybe Mark. It doesn't matter. Maybe I'll gift. Can I gift? How do I gift? How to gift? Uh. I don't even know. I don't know how to gift. I'll figure out for next time and I'll I'll uh I'll gift. We'll do one each. Right. Anyway, yeah, looks like Anthony Gordon and the number nine again because there's no Whistler or Voltermard H. Um yeah, so there you go. Uh but yeah, Hall is the uh disaster catastrophe from Newcastle. Also, Croo Junior and Hall the most significant absentee so far. Next, we've got Everton and I've already seen a disaster. I'll read out the team. It's Pikford O'Brien, Topsy, Branwait, Micheleno, Ghana, Ghana. Two Garners, Adrisa, Ghana, Gay, and uh the other Ghana and Jai, Jhal, George. George is in and Barry and the there's one from every team. It's Keen. Keen is not in the Everton starting lineup. We did kind of know that Keen was circling the drain for that benching with Branweight and Michelenko available. So, um perhaps a little unfortunate but not entirely unexpected. Sean down with the super chat says, \"Fuming was at work and forgot to triple captain.\" Oh, man. Look, could be a blessing in disguise. Last week, someone sent me a message telling me that they accidentally left their captain's armbands on Palmer because they were at work or something. And what ended up happening was Arma scored 20 points and they wanted to move it to Bruno. So they're 10 points up because they made a mistake. It can happen Sean and it could happen to you. You never know. All right. Uh leads up next. We got Darlow, Bogle, Goodmanson, Roodon, Bhol, Borau, Justin, Aidu, Gruv, Aronson, and Meta. So, oh that guy earlier who said that there was a trusted leak of no Calbertt Leuen, they were spot on. We have our fourth um disaster I suppose for gameweek 26. One from each team. This leads one is Calbert Leuen, but like I guess um at least he's not in the squad, so you're going to get an auto sub there. So, not the worst. Queen of the Stone A says, \"Hello, Daniel. Triple captain breakdown on your videos was really helpful.\" So, thank you. I decided not to use the triple captain in the end. Very glad to hear it, my friend. I'm very glad to hear it. The the whole purpose of that was not to convince anyone to or to not triple captain, but just to uh help people understand their options so they can make their own decisions. I always trust people to make their own decisions. And any disasters here? Well, maybe. Maybe. Sanchez, Gusto, Ain Pong, Chalaba, Cukare, Kaisedo, Santos, Palmer, Enzo. Enzo in the 10 again. Estaval, Ja, Pedro, and on the bench. Do people still have Netto? Do people have I don't know who else is missing? Reese, James, not even in the squad. If anyone has uh Netto or James, then that's bad news there. Everything else looks reasonably good. Um, but I I wouldn't call that a disaster. These are real real fringe players. Not really too many FPL managers have these guys. So, we got our first team that really doesn't have any major absentees. Huzzah. Huzzah. And finally, actually, what we got? Shepsi says, \"Think it'll be Enzo left wing again and Steve right wing Palmer 10.\" Oh, yeah. It kind of was like that, wasn't it? Yeah, that makes sense. Interesting. But like I guess it's just like your attacking versus your defense shape which is probably going to be pretty different. So in attack Enzo drifts to the left. Palmer stays central. Estaval is not going to play on the left, is he? I've not seen him play. Estal can't play on the left, can he? I've never seen it happen. thoughts, opinions, and from uh Tottenham, Top Spur. From Top Spur, we have Vicario, Dragassin, Chavy, Bassuma, Grace, Salangi, Gallagher, Spence, Obear, Saw, and Vanderven, the captain. Vanderven is in. Um, who's missing? Romero we knew was missing. Helen, tell. No one has these guys. They're They're banging out the youth players again on the bench. Uh yeah, it won't be rigid. They'll change about. Steve is significantly worse than the left now. Fair enough. Cool. All right. Well, I'll uh I'll take your I'll definitely take your opinion on that one. Um yeah, Enzo on the left then. Calling Estabio Steve is mad. Yeah, I mean that's a fair fair comment. I quite like Steve. It's It's far more pedestrian, isn't it? What was it that they called as Pilqua? Was it Dave at Chelsea? Sometimes, you know, they like to they like to anglify the uh the names over at Chelsea FC. Uh but anyway, guys, so and yeah, no real disasters from Spurs or Chelsea. Major pieces of news is Calbert Leuen not in the squad. Keen on the bench. Uh Hall on the bench. Creepy Junior on the bench. I think most people will probably will have dodged all of those. I think I've dodged all of them. Um so yeah, I think it could be worse. I think that could be worse, couldn't it? It could be worse. Right guys, I think we can pretty much wrap things up. I'm not really feeling like sticking around uh for half an hour to see Manchester United naming an identical squad for the fourth consecutive week. Um Talking Drum says, \"Please advise me on Semeno. I own him, but not sure what to do. You could keep him for now.\" Um I don't see a reason to rush him out. Um JP starts just wish Palmer didn't. Yeah, maybe Palmer get another early bath, early sub. seems to be the trend. Um, yes guys, um, good luck this game week, particularly my fellow triple captains of the Gabrielle variety. Wishing you all the best of luck. Enjoy the midweek game week. Have fun. Enjoy and watch the footy. Chill out. I know I'll be chilling out for a few days. I'm not really going to kick back up with the videos again for a few days now because I really really I don't know. I want to wait for the FA Cup games this weekend really. So, I might take a couple of days off. Let's play some video games, watch some anime, and chill. It's quite nice. Valentine's Day this week as well. Not that I celebrate it, but um maybe I should. But yeah, guys, cheers. Um thank you for all the super chats and support and new members and everything like that. You guys are legends. Um as always, I'll catch you whenever I'm back making content, which will be probably in a few days now. Going to take a couple of days off to watch the football. Um so yeah, cheers guys. Enjoy and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye. Oh, oh, oh. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. All right. Oh. Heat. Heat.",

    "published_at": "2026-02-10T07:30:03+00:00",
    "transcript": "I asked 100 FBL experts for their gameweek 26 transfer plans, captains, and chip strategies so you guys can follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Hello and welcome to FPL Mate. [music] My name is Dan and welcome to the first double gameweek of the season. I can't believe it is finally here. I'm sure uh we're all very excited about this one. it could go crazy. And as such, we are going to be talking a lot about those uh those captains, those triple captains. We got some interesting stuff today, guys. Um so, we're going to be finding out about triple captains, how many of our experts will be playing them this week. We'll also be looking at who those triple captains and and indeed regular captains will be played on. And it's actually really interesting the uh kind of data we have for captains in particular. But we've got all kinds of stuff. We got transfers as well today, guys. So, stick around. Uh massive thank you to the 100 experts who have dedicated their uh their time to giving us their data again this week for 26. Right. Well, I think this is probably the best place to start. Transfers and chips. How many transfers are being made this week? And actually, this is a week where maybe you could consider rolling your transfer, making no transfer whatsoever because around half of our experts will be doing just that. But the majority will be making transfers, but only just. So 41% of our experts will be making one transfer in Game Route 26. 8% will be making two transfers and 2% will be making three or more transfers with one of our experts actually making four transfers this week. Nobody's using a wild card or free hit this week, but we do have some chips being played. 2% of our experts are using the bench boost. So I wouldn't really call that a trend necessarily, but maybe if your bench does look truly truly extraordinary, then maybe that's an argument to play the bench boost. But it's the triple captain that I'm sure we're really interested in here. And without a doubt, 38% of experts using their triple captain in this gameweek is a trend. That is a very strong trend. But it's not conclusive. 38% using a triple captain means that 62% of experts will not be using the triple captain. So technically um most experts are not using a triple captain chip this week. But at 38% that is a very very strong argument. and and that is a very high number indeed. So even though it's not maybe it's maybe not a case where you have to use your triple captainship this week, it is definitely a case where this is a very very strong option indeed. And actually, even at 38%, we may not see a higher number than that between now and the end of the season. Because if the triple captainship is maybe split between a couple of other gameweeks throughout the remainder of the season, 38% in one game week may actually end up being the highest percentage of experts using their triple captainship in one week that we will see for the remainder of the season. So, just wanted to put that one out there. Just because the majority of experts are not using the triple captain chip this week, that doesn't mean that this is automatically not the best week to use the triple captain chip if if that kind of makes sense to you guys. So huge number. I think if you are on or thinking about the triple captain chip, I think that is a large enough percentage of experts to maybe convince you to go for it. But if you are kind of maybe feeling a little cooler on the triple captainship, and by the way guys, if you haven't checked out yesterday's video, my team selection video, we talked about the triple captainship for like 15 minutes. That was like half the video was just triple captain talk. So go check that out if you just want more information about what the other options might be. But yeah, I think really this is maybe not as convincing as maybe a lot of you guys were hoping for. Maybe you maybe wanted to see a 50% plus here. Unfortunately, you're not going to see that. But the trends are significant, guys. And I and I think, you know, that is certainly, you know, it's given me some confidence to pull the trigger. I don't know about you guys, but it's giving me some confidence. It's it's enough for me. Um, but you guys will have to make your own judgment whether it's enough for you to convince you. Let's check out the transfer trends from the overall player base before we go to the expert transfers and and indeed who will be triple captain. And uh yeah, it's one of those weeks where actually the overall player base is not aligned with the experts in terms of the transfer ideas that they have. Really, we are seeing very very uh little correlation between what most FPL managers seem to be doing and what the experts seem to be doing. And in fact, the only player in the top 10 uh most popular transfers in the overall player base that our experts also are strongly transferring in this week is going to be Yurian Timber. Outside of that, there are some transfers in for Declan Rice. There are a couple of transfers in for David Ryer. But outside of that, Jockarez, Bruno, Zuba Mendes, Joel Pedro, and Burmo Palmer Gabrielle. There are no transfers in for any of those. And there are different reasons for that. First of all, players like Bruno Fernandez and Gabrielle in particular. These are two players that are owned by near enough all experts at this point anyway. So yeah, if they weren't, then I'm sure we would see more transfers for them. But outside of that, there's some players who maybe have a little bit of ownership among experts. You know, Burmo is like at 35 40% ownership among experts. Joel Pedro is maybe at 15% ownership. Palmer's maybe at some like 8% ownership among experts. So, still nobody looking to transfer these players in, but at least, you know, some a lot a lot of experts or at least a decent amount of experts have these players already. And then there's other players such as Jockz and Zubendi who make up two of the top three most popular transfers. uh in the overall player base and not only do our experts barely own these players, nobody has Zubendy, I think maybe one or two have Yokarez in their team, but nobody is looking to bring these guys in either. So, we are seeing a a major split here. Yokarez, Zub Mendy, overall player base love these guys. Experts clearly don't like these guys as FPL picks and and really do fancy some of the other Arsenal picks and rate the other Arsenal picks much higher than Yokarez and Zuma Mendy. And there's been a lot of questions this week about Zub Mendy in in my comments. Strangely large amount really. Um, as an Arsenal fan, I I'm not convinced at all by Zub Mendy as an FPL pick. He has scored in the last couple of games, but buying him expecting him to score like these worldy banger goals every single game week. It's just not realistic for him to keep scoring these goals. Ultimately, he is a defensive midfielder. usually he just takes the role of a defensive midfielder and you know doesn't actually get defensive contributions that often considering his deep position. So in general I don't really like Super Mendy as an as an FPL pick. Um particularly because going for him also sacrifices another Arsenal player who could be much much stronger. So that is my opinion on Zub Mendy. I know this video is not usually meant to be about my opinions but because there has been so many Zub Mendy questions I thought this would probably be the best time to answer them. Now, um we are going to be talking about some Arsenal differentials when we come to the um the bonus questions in the video. So, stay tuned for that. We will be talking a little bit more about some of these guys. But, uh yeah, uh for now, let's just stick with what the experts are actually doing this week. So, what the experts are actually doing is uh is selling Dorgu. Yes. Uh so, here are the transfers out, guys. We have seen in recent game weeks that experts have kind of been holding on to Dorgu quite a lot and just leaving him on the bench, but the transfers out for him are picking up. And I think a big part of that is the fact that uh there are more defenders that are looking like good options now. And certainly in the last few game weeks, there's not really been a good jumping on point for a lot of the defenders that we've been looking at. Now we're kind of coming into a place where teams particularly like Crystal Palace and Bournemouth maybe have really nice fixtures and you can just pick some nice cheap or expensive defenders from those teams. So now is a good time to make defender transfers because their options have have certainly grown. Uh there's more options to go for right now that look more convincing than maybe they may have a couple of weeks ago for example. So Dorgu is being sold six transfers out for him. Chiao is being sold six transfers out for him. Um among other defenders we see O'Reilly, Tarovski, Hall there as well. There also some midfielders being transferred out here. Enzo Lefay, three transfers out for him. Lewis Miley, a bit of an injury there. Few transfers out for him. Garner and Jai and Enzo just a couple of transfers out for for Enzo. Majority of experts will be keeping him, but he is another player mentioned in the bonus questions today. In general, I have to be honest with you guys, the transfer out trends in particular this game week, they're not particularly trendy. there. The trends are pretty weak. And actually, even though you see 10 players on this list, there were another maybe five players being transferred in out by maybe two experts each and and then another 20 25 players being transferred out by one expert each. So really what I saw in the data this week was a real spread of loads of different players, often differential players that are being transferred out this week, lowowned players. So, I think this is maybe one of those weeks where you remove maybe some of those players who you're not totally convinced by. Maybe you have them in your team and you don't really see them in many other people's teams. Those are the kind of players that look like the the kind of primary candidates for transfers out this week. Just those random players that you just have in your team. You've had them in your team for a while. You're just waiting for an opportunity to get rid of them. Now is maybe the chance to do exactly that. So, those are your kind of transfers out kind of trends, I guess. And the trend is that there isn't much trend. Just remove players that you're not happy with. It's is the simple answer. I know. If only FPL was that easy every single game week, right guys? But hopefully these videos are making FPL easier. And if they are, make sure you do drop a like. It really is appreciated. And do subscribe if you're new around here as well to follow along with the expert trends every single game week. Right, transfers in, guys. And we have some trendier trends. Yes, we've got a little bit more information here. And I think we can gather a little bit more from this one. So, first of all, Daniel Manoz, great first name, by the way. We do like a Daniel. Um, yeah, 5.8 million defender. A little expensive, but plays Burnley and Wolves in the next two. Really, really nice fixtures indeed. 13 of our experts will be taking the risk, the punt on the high upside Crystal Palace defender. So, he was barely owned by anyone last game week. So, we're seeing some real nice interest in him. And that is a a fairly decent number and a fairly decent trend particularly for a player who is is ultimately differential. He is a player that nobody really had last game week. And we're seeing similar numbers for Isa 11 transfers in for the Crystal Palace midfielder. He's just 6.3 million by the way guys. We expect him to be on penalties probably but not definitely. And um yeah just looks like a really really nice pick given the fixtures and given the form as well. You know scoring in in backto-back games now for Crystal Palace. really nice indeed for that kind of price tag. Outside of that, we're maybe looking at some more Arsenal players. If you haven't got your Timber in your team yet, you need to get that third Arsenal player, then what are you waiting for? The double game week is right now, so make sure you got that Arsenal triple up and Timber is the most transferred in of those Arsenal players this game week with players like Gabrielle and Rice already incredibly heavily owned. So maybe Timberidge maybe that third guy for a lot of experts. Um, the James Hill gang grows. Five new transfers in for James Hill. He's going to be up to 17% ownership among experts. The 3.9 million cheat code. Yeah, I'm so glad people are finally coming around to James Hill. We're going to see his ownership grow with each week. I think Declan Rice, four new transfers in for him to add to his 73 existing owners. Four new transfers in for Richards. Three new transfers in for Man\u00e9. And just a couple of transfers in for players such as Rya Anderson and Joel Gomez who is a little bit of a differential defcon kind of midfielder who plays for Wolves. Maybe some experts looking to get a nice eight-pointer from him in gameweek 26. So those are your transfers in but there is more to talk about today. For example, the template which technically hasn't changed this game week. So um no change in the goalkeepers really a small increase for Rehea in terms of the defenders. Gabrielle still flying high here. Timber up a 7% there up to 63% ownership. So yeah, he is a heavily owned player among experts. And it and it kind of looks like looking through these numbers that our experts will typically own Gabrio and Rice and then one of Rya and Timber. I mean that it's not strictly like that necessarily, but that's what the majority of experts are kind of running as their kind of Arsenal triple up right now, which is why we are seeing four Arsenal players in in the template as the kind of most popular players um that uh that you can kind of get. But certainly Rya are the least popular of those four. I guess the template for I suppose you could call them. Um outside of that, um small decrease for Chalaban, but not really much else change in defense. Um the only changes in midfield were was a little bit of increased ownership for Rice and Burmo and a little bit of a decrease for Enzo. And in the forward position, not much increase or decrease really here either. Small change for Echitique, but that's just about it. So the template has not really changed. A lot of the players that are being brought in are kind of differential players um to to be totally honest with you guys who aren't necessarily going to go straight into the template and we might have to wait another week or two before seeing them in these kind of uh these kind of pages. But anyway guys, no real change on the template. So yeah, hopefully that's all cool with you guys. Average Gameweek 25 score is 70.1 points. Let me know if you beat that score or not. Pretty decent score for the experts. Again, another big green arrow. And the average rank is up to 333,000th in the world. 82% of our experts are in the top 1 million, 22% in the top 100K, and 2% in the top 10K. Although given that it is chip season now, and there the fact that the experts are so unaligned with the overall player base transfers this week, I think that this could maybe get even better by the time we come to next week's video. To be honest with you guys, suggested transfers. If you haven't already got Yuri Timber or your I guess your third Arsenal player, then that's your priority move. So if you got someone like Chiao, got someone like O'Reilly, just any defender where you can afford to make the upgrade to Timber and you haven't done so already, just do it. If not, Daniel Munoz if you've already got your Arsenal player, Daniel Moz if you can go expensive or someone like Hill if you need to go a little bit cheaper at 3.9 million. If you've got a midfielder who you don't really like right now, the first player to get is Declan Rice, that third Arsenal player if you haven't done it already. And if not, you're going to be looking at SR. You're going to be looking at uh, you know, selling someone for Sara. I guess there's not really any other midfielders that are sticking out as transfers in this game. Don't think any of these players are really worth a hit necessarily other than maybe the Arsenal guys because getting your Arsenal sorted really is super important as we're going to find out when we come to the captains next where all of the captains this week come from Arsenal. And I say all of the captains, I mean both of the captains. And I think this is uh this is so useful for so many of the comments that I've been getting on on YouTube videos and on Tik Tok and on Instagram. So many people kind of questioning is Gabrielle really the best captain to go for? Like surely there are better options. Should I go for Rice? Can I go for Zendi? Should I go for Yarez? Well, let me tell you 100% of Gabrielle owners among experts will be captaining him this week. 97 captained, 97 owned, 100% captain hit rate. So, I I I don't really know how to kind of justify this anymore. We've spoken a lot about Gabrielle in uh in some of the other videos this week about how important he is, particularly in yesterday's video when we were talking about the triple captain and the triple captain on Gabrielle. Um so, go check that out if you want the full lowdown. But if you just want to take the expert's word for it, then it's very conclusive. It really is to to see that all Gabrielle owners are captaining him is nothing short of remarkable in terms of uh in terms of trying to get you know a definitive answer because that's what these these videos are really for. Is there expert consensus on anything? Do our experts prefer certain things? There is a complete consensus on this. So no doubt about it. And the only people who are not going to be captaining Gabrielle this week among those top managers really are going to be people who don't have Gabrielle. And in that case, maybe they go for Declan Rice. So 97 captains on Gabrielle, which is one of the highest numbers we have seen in the history of the 100 expert series, which has been running for four years now, and 3% just three going for Declan Rice. I don't even know if we've ever had a situation where 100% of owners are captaining one player, particularly not at these kind of numbers at least. So yeah, very conclusive. If you have Gabrielle, captain him. Um if you don't then Declan Rice is your probably your best second best option. I I don't know I guess. Um in terms of those triple captains, well uh obviously we have 38 triple captainers this gameweek. And I can tell you that all but one of them will be triple captaining Gabrielle. So that's 37 triple captains on Gabrielle and one triple captain on Deckham Rice. And again, I believe that is because that person doesn't own Gabrielle and and they're still looking to triple cap him in gameweek 26 and don't feel it's worth making switches around for, you know, an existing triple up on Arsenal to get Gabrielle in their team. So yeah, um I think this is really really useful for anyone who has kind of been on the fence or kind of secondguessing or doubting some decision- making. You can't do much better than this in terms of looking for um kind of validation on a certain move. And uh yeah, what can I say guys? Gabriel captain at the very least is the way and triple captain is also very much on the cards if you fancy going that way. With that said guys, we have got some bonus questions uh to kind of answer some of the things you have been asking this week. So bonus questions. The first question I asked our experts in the private uh Discord server was, is Enzo Palmer worth the upgrade? A few of you guys have been asking that this week. Uh 77% of our experts say no, it's not worth the upgrade. Just save your transfer. Save it for a rainy day, use it uh for something else this week, whatever. And 23% say yes, it is worth it, but only as a free move, for free transfer. So if you have money on the bank in the bank already and you can make a simple upgrade from Enzo to Palmer, then 23% of experts say do that, but most say don't. uh in terms of using a minus four to move Enzo to Palmer or indeed getting Palmer at all really. Um nobody's nobody is suggesting taking hits to to get Palmer into their team. So yeah, that would be the expert advice on that particular question with regards to Palmer who is of course so very popular this week among I guess non-experts. I suppose the other question was now I don't know if you guys watched last week's episode of the 100 experts but I basically asked which of these uh kind of arsenal differentials would you consider going for but I also included none as an answer and 80% of our experts said none. So, uh, what I thought I'd do this week is I would force my experts to pick an Arsenal differential because I know a lot of you guys you you've seen the template for Rya, Gabrielle, Timber, Rice, and you're still saying, \"I don't care if they're template. I don't care if they're popular. I don't care if the experts like them. I want something a little bit spicy in my team.\" And you know what? Totally fair enough. Um, if you're having more fun going differential and you know there are plenty of times where I've had a great time in FPL going differential, then you should absolutely do it and you should back yourself and you should go with uh what you feel most strongly about rather than you know necessarily just going boring all the time. I totally get it. So I forced the experts to pick a differential for you guys out of the following options. Yarez, Zubendy, Celiba, Havits, Califuri, Madaw Trosard, Gabrielle Jesus and Martinelli. you were forced to answer experts and 39% said Jockz is the best of these Arsenal differentials to go for and indeed he is the most popular in the overall player base as well. So if you are fancying going a little bit different Yokarez would be your guy. Celiba is in second place here 28% so you know maybe going for that triple up in the Arsenal defense potentially there could be really really interesting. Um and maybe Celiba is going to be part of that triple up. If so amazing. Um 11% said Zubame Mendy, 11% said Madawekke. So despite the the the high popularity of Zub Mendi, I could only convince 11% of experts to say that they would go for him and only if they were forced to. So uh yeah, that tells you all you need to know there. 6% would say Hav 6% said Trosard. Nobody said Califury, Trosard, or Martinelli. All considered too high risk for this gameweek. So there we go guys. If you do desperately want to go for a differential, go for Yokarez. Maybe go for Celiba. But I cannot stress enough, the true expert advice is to go for none of these guys and to stick with three out of Rya, uh, Gabrielle, Timber, and Rice. Three out of those four. That is what the experts are truly saying. So, there we go. But still interesting stuff and we make these videos to hopefully be a little bit interesting. Let me know if there are any other final questions before the deadline today, guys. Do drop a like. Do subscribe if you like this video as well. We'll be back for a deadline stream this afternoon. A couple of hours before deadline, we will be live on this YouTube channel answering more of your questions. So, make sure you join me there. Looking forward to seeing a few of you guys there. And I will [music] see you later, mates. Bye-bye.",

    "transcript": "Gameweek 26 is here and whilst we look at a potential triple captain this week, we also need to make some transfers as well. So, there are so many big decisions to be made this week as we lock in for FPL gameweek 26. Welcome to FPL, mate. My name is Dan, guys. A nice green arrow for me in game me 25. I would call it maybe a cheeky little green arrow because nothing enormous here, but we are edging ever closer to the uh the fabled top 100k that uh I'm desperate to get in nice and early this season ahead of chip season. So, this is what we're looking at, guys. 73 points scored in game 25. Let me know how you guys did as well. Rehea and Gabrielle doing the business with a clean sheet. Hill. James Hill. Nobody had heard of him a couple of weeks ago, but we picked him up and he is doing so so well for that 3.9 million back-to-back seven-pointers this week with Defcon and an assist. Bruno captain worked out well and Burmo pretty nice as well with the goal there. Declan Rice with the Defcon as with Anderson. Harland coming through with an assist and a penalty goal. And Ekit, how he didn't return against Man City, I have no idea. But at least his underlying numbers are continuing to be really really good and we will talk about that. But most of all guys, I want to talk about today um a little bit about transfers, but mostly about triple captain. So, let's get involved with that guys because it is such a big decision to be made. And if you need some good luck ahead of gameweek 26, some good karma, make sure you do drop a like on the video to follow along with my team. Feel free to subscribe as well. We do this every week. So, I have one free transfer, 3.2 million in the bank, all backlogged from that Sacka to Rice transfer from last week. Let's see what we're dealing with right now. We do have Rya in goal for his double gameweek. Nice guaranteed minutes there. Him actually outscoring Timber last gameweek. I wonder if that can happen again. Ryer actually in fairness has been doing just as well if not better than Timber in recent weeks. In defense, we've got the Arsenal defensive double up with Gabrielle though looking pretty nice there. Looking pretty smart there. And we've got Malik Chow and Hill here as well. Chia has been a continual disappointment over the last three game weeks. In fairness, I haven't started him every week, but I would probably be looking to start him against Spurs this week. Um, if I keep him, that is. And that is another conversation. Hill, on the other hand, against Everton, I'm pretty happy about him. I'm pretty happy about his defcon potential, and I'm just going to pretty much play him every week, I think. Well, at least most weeks for the upcoming gameweeks because Bournemouth really do look like they're improving defensively. And, uh, yeah, Defcon Hill is now kind of the second best over a six gamewe period. Hill is the second best def corner in the entire league among defenders. Only strike at leads is doing better than Hill right now. So insane defcon corn connor some assist potential apparently. And uh yeah I think clean sheets are going to be become more and more common as we go through the gameweeks. On my bench guys I do have Tvka. No way I'm starting him ahead of the double gameweek Rya. We've got Collins against Arsenal. Alderate against Liverpool. Obie just there as a a placeholder really. And we've got really a situation where I don't know who I'm going to put as my first backup defender. I'm keeping a close eye on Collins because I'm not sure what his kind of situation is with whether he's going to start starting games again. We need to keep an eye on press conferences for that one if he is out of favor or if he is going to start playing or not. Um I can give him this week at least. I don't need to make a transfer on him necessarily. But if something did come out and there's maybe some kind of issue with Collins at the moment and it looks unlikely that he'll play longterm, then maybe I do need to reconsider Collins and maybe he'll be a priority transfer out this week. But I think we can give it one more week. We can give it another round or two of press conferences and hopefully get more information on that one. Alder arguably needs to go above Collins on my bench as well at home against Liverpool. We know Sunderland can be a very tricky opposition um when they do play at home uh against any team pretty much. So um yeah, interesting one there. Maybe I do need to put Alder first on the bench, but we'll have to wait and see there. Looking through the clean sheet odds for my defenders this week, guys. And um I've got here uh I've taken this from Solio because Rob T hasn't posted at time of recording. Um we see Arsenal, of course, are going to be on top here. 38% chance of a clean sheet against Brenford, 51% chance of a clean sheet against Wolves, giving them a total projected clean sheet of 0.89. So I think we're looking at one clean sheet is probably, you know, realistic. one of out of the two games, we'll probably see a clean sheet. Um, outside of that, we do have some other teams genuinely with decent chances. Crystal Palace and Man City, for example, really, really nice numbers here. Uh, Crystal Palace at home against Burnley, uh, I'm definitely interested in that. Man City, Nottingham Forest, if you guys have players from those teams, pretty nice. As with Liverpool against Sunderland, 37%. Uh, even Chelsea, Aston Villa, and Man United looking pretty good. Maybe people expected Chelsea to be a little higher on this list, but Chelsea just not been super strong defensively. I'm looking at some of my other defenders. Uh we've got Hill 24% chance of a clean sheet against Everton, but I think uh the the markets haven't quite adjusted to Bournemouth who seemingly are improving defensively and uh 26% on Newcastle. Again, have the markets adjusted towards Newcastle seemingly incapable of keeping a clean sheet at the moment? It's looking pretty rough for them. So, those are your kind of clean sheet odds. And I think that does kind of back up why I've got kind of a Sunderland defender on the bench and a Brenford defender on the bench. Both of those have 17% uh chance of a clean sheet against their teams, which is pretty low to be fair. Pretty low indeed. So, I think I'm happy with the defenders I have on field, although maybe a transfer is needed because outside of the Arsenal guys, um none of my defenders have good clean sheet odds this week. And the plan always was originally to make a defender transfer this week to try and just improve my chances, improve my odds of of picking up a clean sheet and indeed defensive contributions as well because which is um you know super important to the way I'm playing FPL this season. Let's look at my midfield guys. Bruno and Burmo, Rice, Enzo, and Anderson. Not too much needs to be said about Bruno. I think he's just going to be a set and forget captain in those non double game weeks, if that makes sense. Looking really strong every week with so many ways of getting points. and Burmo um potentially picked up a little knock. He was seen limping out of the out of the stadium um in gameweek 25. So, small concerns there. Uh but I think he he has trained today and I think he's trained just fine. So, I think is going to be fine to play this week, but I just wanted to flag it up with you guys that there is maybe a tiny bit of concern about him kind of limping out the stadium like wondering what's going on there. Was it just cramp, a little bit of soreness? Is it just a knock with the game in a couple of days? Is there a a small chance of him being rested, rotated, whatever? And I think there is a very small chance, but I'm very much leaning towards Burmo playing and I'm not going to really action it unless there is something said in press conferences. I'm not going to, you know, sell and Burma or anything like that unless unless something big comes out, which I don't think it will. Delin Rice looks good for this gameweek. Defcon is back and with him playing a little bit of a a deeper role in gameweek 25, it could be that he is going to be more of a defcon um midfielder for the next couple of gameweeks. I mean, if he can get a nine-pointer from some defcon and um you know, two games played, then that's going to be pretty nice. But that said, being on set pieces, being on free kicks, being on corners, you never know when you're going to get the big hall. Just ask Dominic Soaslai who's got a few uh corner assist, well, mostly free kick goals recently as well, hasn't he? That could be Declan Rice next. We know that that Arsenal really alongside Manchester United with the Bruno and Burmo taking the the corners there are the set piece masters of the league. Enzo still looks good. Really good underlying numbers. Really unfortunate not to get any attacking returns last game week um against Wolves. He had had actually had much better non-penalty uh kind of expected numbers than Palmer and in infinitely better than Joel Pedro who pretty much just won two penalties and did nothing else the whole game in terms of FPL uh contributions. I'm talking of course. So Enzo I still think looks really really strong. Um the the difference between him and Palmer literally just came down to a bit of luck, bit of penalty and you know sometimes that can be an 18 point swing apparently. But yeah, that's just FPL for you guys. There's no guarantee that it's going to happen the same way this week. Though I have no real interest in upgrading Enzo to Palmer or anything like that. Some of you guys maybe will and maybe you'll value those penalties a little bit more. You'll value Palmer a little bit more. But for for me, Enzo numbers still look really good. Minutes still look really good. Still going to be on penalties when Palmer is off the pitch. Still going to have set piece share. Particularly with James injured. I'm still, you know, not really looking to sell him. And Anderson, the Defcon guy. Four points in gameweek 25. Could it be four points, five points in gameweek 26? The clean sheet odds are pretty good, so we could see a nice five-pointer for him. You never know. Could get some bonus as well given he is so busy on the pitch. Harland and Ekit are my two forwards. Maybe some confidence renewed in Harland because he scored a penalty. Yes, I know guys. Uh but the 11pointer I think will at least kind of calm the questions down about whether Harland is a cell or not. We did mention last game week Harland isn't a cell because there's not really any better options right now if you're not worried about money. He's still on penalties and the fixtures still look good. Um, you know, proof is in the pudding in gaming week 25. I think I'm just going to continue to own Harland unless, you know, something changes in terms of me needing money for something. It's just not really the case right now. And Ekit still really happy with him in terms of his performances. He's getting chances to score. He's looking really hot. And kind of if we go through some of these numbers, guys, over the past six game weeks, and this is uh a table of the past six game weeks, and we've got expected goal involvements per start. Um, we've excluded low minutes players. We've got Harland second here with 0.8 expected goal involvements per start in the past six game weeks. Really good. Enzo really high with Bruno 0.7 each. Very nice. And Burma 0.5, Rice 0.4. So, you know, even though people have kind of been down on Rice recently, it's mostly his creativity. Looks looks really strong right now. If we switch this and include players who are have low minutes as well, which would include someone like Egyp who's only started three of the last six due to injury problems. Um he's actually top of this list. So one expected goal involvements per start. Every time he starts he's expected to get one goal involvement because his xG numbers are just so high. 0.81 xG per start. That's for a non- penalty taker. Absolutely incredible. And 0.2 to expected assists per start as well in this I guess small period of games. But even across the season and we're going to see a little later on uh Ecatik's numbers whenever he starts are phenomenal. So you can forget this just being a small sample size. He is just a player with fantastic numbers and always has opportunities to score goals and sometimes to get assists as well. And I think that is going to really um improve when we get to some of these nicer fixtures after Sunderland which I think is a little bit of a tricky one. Forest may be tricky after that. amazing. The fixtures are really good for Liverpool and Echitique. So, I'm looking forward really to seeing what he can produce next. So, guys, let's talk about transfers. First of all, um I need a new defender. I think that's my priority. I'm not 100% sure I'm I'm going to do it. I could just keep Malik Chow in the defense and not make any other changes because I think my attack looks really good. I'm happy with the attack right now, at least for this game, week where I might be looking to make some changes in game 27, but for now, looks good. Um, in defense, I'm not totally convinced. I've already mentioned that my clean sheet odds outside of the Arsenal guys, not particularly high. Chia, not particularly high. Hill I have more confidence in to be fair. So, one of Chiao or Collins probably needs to go. Chiao is probably going to be the guy who I sell because I think he's probably going to drop in price soon and I'm very tight for budget when it comes to my transfer plans that we will talk about. So, right now, the player I'm looking at is a actually going to be a downgrade. I want to free up some money so I could eventually do Rice to Verts and Obi to Thiago to fill out my squad with players ready for blank gameweek 31. So that's going to be really really nice if I can manage to do that. But we need to free up just a little bit more money in order to do that in the coming gameweek. So what are we going to do? Who are we going to downgrade Malik Sha to? Well, look no further than Chris Riches. Now, I feel like I've been fairly good at picking out defenders this season, going ahead of the crowd and picking some players that are not really too many pe other people are going for. We've done Hill, we've done Collins, we've done Shia, we've found some success in all three of these guys recently. But the OG defender that I kind of I guess scouted in a way. I'm sure many of you you guys managed to scout him as well individually, independently. Um but but yeah, the first player I scouted this season was Chris Richards who looked like a really nice differential option under 1% owned at the start of the season, 4.5 million. Well, now he's 4.4 million. Still the one of the greatest defconers in the league. So defensive contributions really nice and he has his two very best fixtures for clean sheets he will have in the entire season in the next two game weeks. Burnley at home, Wolves at home. You there is no two better fixtures if you're looking for clean sheets in the Premier League. This is really really amazing stuff and I think we've just got to just got to go for it. If you need a defender for the next two game weeks and maybe a few game weeks beyond that because we also do have Richard with leads at home in gameweek 30 which I could think could be nice playable in 29 against Spurs away. Um to be fair like because he's a death corner he can be played pretty much any gameweek and it's not like he plays any like Arsenals or Liverpools or Man cities anytime soon or anything like that. And yes, he is going to be blanking in gameweek 31. But actually, because of my specific transfer plans and the way I've kind of set up my team, even if I did have too many uh too many like uh players who blank in 31, and I won't, I would still have an additional four transfers to fix it after that or three transfers to fix it after that. So, I I'm not in a position where I need to worry really about picking up players who don't play in 31 right now because I'm pretty light really and I already have plans to kind of fix a lot of these things anyway. And by the time I get to game at 31, I'll either just bench Richers and I'll still have a starting 11 or I'll sell him to someone like Anderson um at Fulham who plays against Burnley that week. Um that's a little far in in the future, guys, to be honest. But yeah, I think Riches works really well for my team. recovers me for the next two game weeks really well whilst we can continue to assess the Collins situation. Meanwhile, Alder is also going to be available as a potential play next week. Hill is a good play every single game week as is Gabrielle. So, I think this will really really sort out my defense. Um, you know, which is maybe starting to show a little bit of a few cracks this gameweek that that definitely could be improved upon. So, yeah, shout to Richards. Uh, that looks like the move. It just looks like the move. So, with that said, guys, with the transfer done, I I did say that I wanted to spend a little bit of time today on triple captain talk because I think this is probably the biggest topic of the day. It really is. And a lot of you guys will be wondering, shall I pull the trigger on the triple captain? And I think it's really important to know kind of what the alternatives are. You know, if if we're going for triple captain against Gabrielle or in Gabrielle this week, for example, what are the other options? you know, what are we missing out on if we go for it this week essentially is what I'm trying to say. And is it actually worth waiting? Well, let's go through that right now, guys. So, let's start off right here. And this is a table of players and their points per start in the Premier League so far this season. And we see an a nice clear top three here. Harland 7.54 uh points per start this this season. He's only just overtaken literally this game he's only just overtaken Gabrielle who was on 7.44 points per start. So prior to uh the hall from Harland in gameweek 25, Gabrielle was actually on top here. In third place we have Bruno Fernandez a little bit further behind at 6.41 points per start. Um by the way shout out to Ecadik who is in fourth place. Six points per start. I told you guys he is a good pick. You just got to you just got to start games. Uh he will get opportunities. There are some other players who are pretty high hit as well, but I think there's not really too much point in looking outside of Harland, Gabrielle, and Bruno. I think these are the three standout players in the Premier League this season when you're looking to get yourself some nice FPL points. So, what we need to do next is kind of identify double game weeks. We know Gabrielle has a double gameweek in gameweek 26 right now, but what about the other guys? What are these kind of double game weeks going to look like? Can we beat Gabrielle against uh Brenford and Wolves? Can we do better than that? Well, let's let's have a look. So, let's uh take a look at this double gameweek table, guys. I update this regularly throughout the season, and this is my predictions for the double when the double game weeks are going to be and also what the double game will be as well for each team. So, we need to look at Manchester United first of all, and and kind of talk about Bruno. And there is only one scenario in which Manchester United can get a double game this season or at least one likely scenario realistic scenario because likely is is uh pushing it a little bit. And the only way it can happen is if Brenford reach the semifinals of the FA Cup. If Brenford reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, they will very likely have their fixture from gameweek 34 against Manchester United moved into gameweek 33, creating a Manchester United double gameweek of Chelsea away and Brenford at home. So, that is the best realistic way we're looking at Manchester United getting a double gameweek this season. The problem is, of course, with that is number one, um, we've got to get Brenford to the FA Cup semi-finals first. And I don't know how likely that is. Don't get me wrong, it's possible, but are we going to be counting on that happening? I don't know. It's it's really risky. We have a double gameweek right now. Are we really going to bet on Manchester United maybe getting a double gameweek when it's not even guaranteed? I don't know. The second problem is that gameweek 33 looks so much better for a bench boost or a free hit. Because it's going to be the largest double gameweek of the season, we need to use our chips that really benefit having a large amount of double game weeks. With the triple captain chip, you only need one team. I mean, it's technically not possible. You have to have two teams, but you only need one team to have a double game week and suddenly you've got a scenario where actually is possible for one only one team to have a double game. That's a whole other tangent. Um, it is technically possible, but anyway, um, you only need one team to have a double game week in order to use the triple captainship because the chip is focused on just one player. Whereas your free hit and your bench boost, a large amount of double game weeks, that is where you see the real benefit of those chips. So gameweek 33 for me is going to be a bench boost week with gameweek 34 is going to be my free hit week. I'm confident about this strategy, really confident, and we will be doing another chip strategy video very soon where we'll be talking a little bit more, narrowing things down a little bit more and exploring maybe some alternatives. But for me, I can't see a world in which I don't use either the bench boost or free hit in gameweek 33. They're just so much more going to be so much more effective in the biggest double game week of the season which should see around eight teams double. So triple captain for gameweek 33 is just ruled out for me. It's not happening. I'm sorry. It's just it's not happening. So we need to look at any possible double gameweeks outside of gameweek 33. Is there anything else that's possible? And there is. There is indeed. So, one thing about the fact that uh the Man City versus Crystal Palace game has been moved out of gameweek 31 and it's not been rescheduled into gameweek 26 just because of cup clashes or or you know clashes with uh Crystal Palace playing in the Europa Conference League. Um you know they they're not available to play in the midweek of 26 27. So, the most likely uh places where this Crystal Palace game against Man City will be kind of placed is either gameweek 33 or gameweek 36. It's going to be one of those two. So, we are going to see most likely, you know, like 99% we're going to see at least one Manchester City double game week this season. One of which will be uh somewhere with, you know, Crystal Palace going in somewhere whether that's 33 or 36. So, we could see Arsen uh we could see Man City against Arsenal and Crystal Palace in 33. We kind of already ruled that out. Or most likely gameweek 36 where we'd see Burn Brenford uh at home and Crystal Palace at home potentially there as well. Could also be gameweek 35. That's a whole other thing. But one of gameweek 35 or 36 will be that second double gameweek for Man City because we also have the FA Cup scenario. So if one of Manchester City or Burnley reached the FA Cup semi-final and I'd say that's much more likely than Brenford reach Brenford in isolation reaching the FA Cup semi-finals then that is going to create that second double gameweek. That is going to mean that not only will we need fixtures rescheduling into gameweek 33 but we'll also need that fixture as we mentioned rescheduled into 35 or 36. So, it's basically going to be either Crystal Palace or Burnley are going to be the kind of additional fixture for Man City in most likely gameweek 36, possibly gameweek 35. So, if we're looking at kind of triple captain opportunities there, you're looking at Harland really against uh if if it's gameweek 36, it's going to be against Brenford at home and one of Burnley or Crystal Palace or maybe and less likely gameweek 35 Everton away and again one of Crystal Palace or Burnley. We don't know which one it's going to be. It kind of depends what happens. I think it's more likely it will be Burnley put in there to be honest. So, that is what a Man City and that's what a Harland uh double game week could look like. So, we got Arsenal, we got Gabrielle against Brenford and Wolves. Or we've got the possibility of uh Harland against one of Everton or Brenford and then one of Burnley or Crystal Palace. That maybe looks a bit better with Harland. Do you guys agree? I don't know, maybe you will, maybe you won't, but maybe that looks a little bit better, the Harland option. Um because those are nice fixtures, particularly if Burnley gets put in there. That's really nice indeed. But there are three problems with the Harland triple captain in that kind of gameweek 36/game35 kind of area. The first problem is we don't actually know it will happen. Of course it is likely that Man City or Burnley do reach the FA Cup semi-final, more likely Man City, sorry Burnley fans. But that is pretty likely, but it's not guaranteed. And if it doesn't happen, well then there's no double game week in 35 or 36 for Man City. It just doesn't happen. then you're pretty much going to have to commit to using a triple captain on a single game week unless some of the kind of outlier kind of chances of some more double game weeks maybe in 36 or 37 do come true because there are still some other possibilities. There are still some other possibilities and we'll talk about them and we'll explore them later on when we do the next chip strategy video. Um there are some other opportunities but if we're looking at Harland specifically is this game 36 you want really or maybe game 35 that's what you want from him. So, it's not guaranteed to happen, but it's likely to happen. Next problem. Okay. What if Harland gets injured? If Harland gets injured, would you be as comfortable doing a triple captain on a Marmoo or a uh Bill Foden or a Ryan Chery? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. So, maybe Semeno to be fair. Maybe Semeno. But would you be as comfortable if you know Harland got an injury at some point between now and in literally months time? We're talking like two and a half, three months. This is we're talking like May before the next d this uh this double next triple captain opportunity is going to be like April May kind of time. So we're talking months in advance. So would you be comfortable if Harland got injured captaining a different Man City player? Maybe, maybe not. And the third problem is what about rotation? So say Man City are in the FA Cup kind of semifinals. They're in they're going far in the Champions League as well. They've got all of these fixtures in all of these competitions that they're competing for. What if Harland needs a rest against a team like Burnley in gameweek 36? Because gameweek 37 will be just a couple of days after. So, will it be prime time to rest someone like Harland in what is maybe on paper an easier fixture where Marmush could do a pretty good job there if he was required to? Maybe. So we could see that Harland is maybe rotation risk later in this in the season, particularly if Manchester United are still competing in other competitions and particularly even more if maybe Man City are out of the title race because there is a scenario in which Man City are out of the title race by gameweek 36 or at least the second game of gameweek 36 and as such just completely prioritize other competitions and you know in that case Harland really high chance of of being arrested. So, lots of variables there with the Harland triple captain potential. Lots of variables indeed. And I think it really comes down to your appetite. So, just to just to reframe it in a nice and simple way, you are looking at either Gabrielle right now, you know, he's fit, he's available, he is likely to start both games against Brenford and Wolves. Looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. Not I don't want to say it looks perfect, but it looks pretty good. The other alternative realistically kind of that looks kind of, you know, convincing right now as a realistic possibility is Harland against probably Brenford in gamewick 36 and one of Burnley or Crystal Palace, more likely Burnley in my opinion. The Man City one, the Harland one, it looks better, but it comes with significant risks. When you put all of the risk factors together, it comes with significant risks. So, you kind of need to make a decision. Do you want to stick or do you want to twist? Do you want to go for what you know is in front of you? Do you want to take uh the bird in the hand if you like or do you fancy a go at the two in the bush? And uh certainly Harland Gaming 36 is two in the bush. Uh so yeah uh we'll see. We'll see what happens uh with all of that. I'm not really here to tell you which option you should be taking. I don't think and I think it you just kind of have to make a decision. Do I want to play it safe? Do I want to take a risk? I'd rather you guys have the information um available to you and know kind of a realistic outlay of what the options are um so you can make a realistic, you know, a comfortable decision for yourself. But for me, I just feel I would rather take the bird in the hand. Um I'm an Arsenal fan. I would love to support an Arsenal triple captain. I've not really been able to do that in recent years playing FPL. I really like the look of this one. And I think with Gabrielle there are there is some real potential to get a mega score here. I don't know how likely it is to happen but let's kind of figure it out. So I'm thinking Gabrielle triple captain. I'm like 80% triple captain Gabrielle for this gameweek for the kind of reasons we've already outlaid. What am I expecting from here? Well realistically let's go through. So clean sheet odds. We've got a projected clean sheets of 0.89. So let's say one clean sheet and maybe the other game Arsenal concede one goal. I think that's a pretty arsenal thing to do. So immediately you've got four points for playing. You've got one clean sheet. That's takes us to eight points. Then we look at Defcon next. And how likely is that to happen? Well, let's go back to Tom Hadley's uh graphic here that he posted a couple of weeks ago about the teams that give away Defcon points the most. Brenford give away defcon points to center backs 50% of the time. And we see Wolves give away Defcon points to center backs around 30% of the time. and Gabrielle in general gets Defcon points in around one in three games as well. So I think it is I think it is reasonable to expect uh defensive contribution points in one of the two games. So one clean sheet, one hit of the defcon, that takes us to 10 points without really doing very much. You add bonus points to that, maybe one bonus point, 11 points. That's a pretty basic scenario. uh a very realistic, you know, low expectations kind of scenario where he gets 11 points for a triple captain, 33 points. I think I'd be okay with it. I think I would be okay with that. But it could be so much more because what if we get extra bonus points? What if we get Defcon in both games? What if we get clean sheets in both games? What if we get, heaven forbid, a goal in one of the games? It is so so possible for Gabrielle. He's due a bullet header, right guys? And he has been kind of popping them in, you know, pretty regularly. If we go through his kind of expected numbers throughout the season, we expect an attacking return once every I don't know like five or six games, which what gives us I don't know over a double game week maybe a I don't know like maybe like a 60% chance maybe. Is that too much? No, like a 30% chance maybe of an attacking return. I don't know. It gives us like a 30% chance of an attacking return. 30 to 40% chance which I think isn't too bad. So I think 10 11 points as a base and then maybe a 30% chance let's be conservative of an attacking return on top of that which would push up the bonus points as well. I don't know guys there is a lot of potential here and you know if everything goes exactly to plan there is no reason why Gabrielle can't come away from this gameweek with like a 20 plus pointer this week. It's so possible. you know, if he gets the the clean sheet defcon um and goal combo, that's 17 points if he just does that in one of the two games. If he can do anything in the second game as well, we're looking at 20 points plus. And and that is just a monster monster score that is going to be hard to match even for Harland later on in the season. It's not going to be an easy feat to match. So, yeah, that's where I'm at right now, guys. I I think triple captain Gabrielle 26 is potentially the one because, you know, we know the scenario right now. We know the potential and uh it just seems like the sensible thing to do. Maybe too sensible for some people, but I'm not got a problem with it. So, yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Triple captain, vice captain, by the way, is on Declan Rice. Um, in case anyone cares, but I mean, I'm not I'm not expecting or I'm I'm really hoping that that is not needed uh this week. Let's put it that way. Let's check out some of my transfer moves. Uh moving forward, we're are we are on of course on the uh fantasy football hub my team tool. If you want to check this out, use the link in the description and you can get a nice free trial to get full access to all of the hub tools. So yeah, we've spoken about gameweek 26 already. I'm still got pretty much the same plan of moving uh like I said Obi to Thiago and then in gameweek 28 maybe. Uh it will be one or the other. I don't know who I'll do first, but probably this way round and it'll be vert in for gaming 28 in this example. Um, which I know it keeps telling me that I'll be minus four in the bank, but it's just not true. I I can definitely afford this. In fact, I have.1 million to spare uh when making these transfers as well. So, that is what my my team will look like kind of gameweek 28. From there, I'll probably be looking to downgrade Enzo. I mean, I'll definitely play verse over Enzo, by the way. Um, but uh I'll be looking to, you know, take away Enzo out of the team uh at some point after that. Might not be in game at 28. Um, maybe game it 29. Maybe do something like Enzo to Wilson because I think Wilson's good fixtures start from there. West Ham uh through to Burnley in 31. So something like that. And then we can throw Wilson on the team. Maybe we don't have to play Anderson against Man City in that scenario. And then uh etc etc. Gameweek 30 will start to look better. We mentioned gameweek 31 maybe doing something like uh Richards to um Anderson as well. But again, we're going to have spare transfers in case anything goes wrong. This is kind arguably a bit of a luxury move and it would kind of leave our team looking something. We play Collins, assuming Collins is still playing, by the way, guys, because that could be an issue I need to deal with. But assuming Collins is playing, it leaves us with something a little bit like this. So, uh we'll have a full 11. um a full 11 for gaming 31 and a player on the bench and you know transfers to spare on top of that as well. And yes, I can afford it even though the screen is telling you I can't I definitely can. I've checked this out already. So yeah, something like that for gameweek 31 think could be pretty nice indeed. Um I'm I'm well planned, well prepared I think for gameweek 31 without having to use a free hit ship or anything like that. But anyway guys, that's going to be it for today. Please do drop a like. Please do subscribe as well. And let me know your thoughts on the triple captain situation this week as well. If you have any other questions surrounding it, I'll be more than happy to try and help you guys out with regards to chips and and strategy and doubles and blanks and all that stuff, guys, cuz I usually think I I I know what I'm talking about when it comes to this kind of thing. It's like maybe one of my specialties, but who knows, guys. Thanks for watching. Check out Keeper Void if you haven't done already, and I will see you tomorrow for 100 experts. See you later, mates. Bye-bye.",

    "transcript": "Should you use your triple captain chip in double game week 26? Is this really the best week to use it or could there be a better week? Let's find out. Let's start off by identifying the players who we would be comfortable with using the triple captainship on. And right now there are three players that stand out to me. Harland, Gabrielle, and Bruno Fernandez. These three top the charts for FPL points per game this season. Next, we want to use our triple captainship on a double gameweek if possible. two fixtures in one gameweek, which means double the opportunity to score points. So, it feels like a no-brainer. We know Gabrielle has a double gameweek right now. He faces Brenford and Wolves away in gameweek 26. But what about Bruno and Harland? Let's look at Bruno first. In order for him to get a double gameweek, Brenford need to reach the FA Cup semi-finals. This would move their fixture against United from gameweek 34 to gameweek 33, creating a double gameweek 33 for Bruno against Chelsea away and Brenford at home. Although the chances of this happening are fairly unlikely. And even if it comes through, gameweek 33 will be the largest double gameweek of the season with plenty of double fixtures. And a bench boost or free hit chip will be far more effective to use in gameweek 33. Therefore, we can pretty much rule out Bruno as a triple captain. Harland will almost certainly have a double gameweek this season. Man City already have an unscheduled fixture against Crystal Palace which will most likely be moved into gameweek 33 or gameweek 36 to create a double gameweek in one of those. If either Man City or Burnley reach the FA Cup semi-finals, this creates the opportunity for a second city double gameweek. So right now the most likely double gameweeks for Harland are gameweek 33 against Arsenal at home and one of Palace or Burnley or gameweek 36 against Brenford and one of Palace or Burnley again, which looks much more appealing. This scenario is quite likely and Harland is in a good position to get that nice gameweek 36 double gameweek. So based on current information, the most convincing alternative to a gameweek 26 Gabrielle triple captain is Harland in gameweek 36. And it's a case of stick or twist. The Harland triple captaincy arguably looks better on paper, but there's no guarantee it will actually happen. There's no guarantee Harland will be fit and available. And there's also no guarantee that Harland will even start both games, especially if City are prioritizing other competitions towards the end of the season. Therefore, I will probably be playing it safe and sticking with the triple captain Gabrielle this week. But for those of you who are feeling a bit riskier, a twist to Harland in gameweek 36 has got to be tempting. Make sure to follow for more FFL tips and chip strategy.",

    "transcript": "Gameweek 26 is here already and guys, it is the first double game rig of the season. So, I'm sure a few of you guys will be looking to make some transfers. Well, let's see who we should buy in this week's buyer void. This video is split into two parts. The first of which we'll be looking at those players you may already have in your team and which ones you should keep and which ones you should sell. Then, we'll be looking at players you might not have and which players you should buy and which players you should avoid. plays will be tier listed with the best plays at the top and the worst ones at the bottom. Welcome to FBM. My name is Dan. Yes, guys. A Tuesday deadline means an early buy, sell, keep, avoid episode today, guys. Unfortunately, we are recording this video before the Sunday games, but we've had eight out of 10 gameweek 25 games done now. So, I think we can make some pretty good assumptions. And to be honest, we're mostly looking at Arsenal anyway, aren't we, right now? But let's go through things anyway. So, we got to start off with those forwards you might already have in your team. And I think Harland, even though he hasn't played yet, assuming he is even starting on Sunday, some of you guys will know more than me right now about Harland, but I think over the long term, we are going to see him start regularly. The next game after the Liverpool game is going to be against Fulham at home, and I think that is a decent fixture. Have Newcastle at home, Newcastle team that still conceding plenty of goals there as well, followed by Leads and an out of form Nottingham Forest at home. So, there are still some really good fixtures for Harland coming up. So assuming he is starting and I don't see why he wouldn't be when we come to these fixtures, I think there is still going to be plenty of opportunities and I think by removing Harland from your team, you are taking such an enormous risk that's probably just not worthwhile. So provided you don't need the money and for most people they're not going to need the money. Harland is just going to be a keep. His underlying data is still very strong. He's still the penalty taker at Manchester City and the fixtures are good enough for him as well. So no strong reason to sell in my opinion. Ektika is also going to be a keep here. I I think the Sunderland away game is maybe a little bit tricky. Um but I think Forest is maybe turning into a slightly easier fixture on recent form and after that we got likes of West Ham and Wolves there as well. So I like the look of Eatique really for this run of fixtures. He's clearly in redhot form at the moment. No pun intended and I think he is going to continue to deliver. He's got some of the best underlying numbers in the entire league per I guess 90 minutes. But the problem has been whether he's going to be playing or not. Recently, we've seen him play three games. One of them was a sub appearance. 1.83 xG and 0.61 xa during that time is really good numbers for the limited minutes he's had play. So, as long as he keeps playing, which I think he should do now, he is getting back to his full fitness. Each is still long-term absent. I think Ekit is going to be great. Thiago is the other player I would definitely be looking to keep. Now, um if you've sold him recently, maybe you missed out on his five-pointer in game meet 25. not the worst thing in the world, but if you did keep him, you got that. And even though you're probably going to be looking to bench him against Arsenal. Hopefully, you can cover him for this week. I don't think it would be the end of the world if you had to play him against uh Arsenal in 26, but ideally you would bench him. But I think the thing is here, his fixtures from gameweek 27 or more particularly from gameweek 28 are just so good. And I think a lot of people will be looking to buy Thiago after this gameweek. So if you already have him, you can essentially save yourself a transfer just by holding on to him one week against Arsenal. Hopefully bench him and after that I think the points will definitely come and I think next week's by seller void video. We're going to be looking to put Thiago in the buy section very very heavily. In fact, maybe even the top of the buy section for forwards into our monitors. I think Watkins even though he is a bit expensive, his numbers are okay. He's back and available of course as we know and the fixtures are pretty decent over the next four. But even that Chelsea at home game, I don't mind for Watkins too much. Chelsea still conceding plenty of chances we as we see week on week. Um not sure if Watkins is going to be the penalty taker or not. I think there's a lot of people speculating around who will be the next penalty taker for Aston Villa. So yeah, no promises there, but certainly you know his numbers are okay. The fixtures are good. His price is a little high, which is why he's not necessarily a keep, but a very high monitor. After that, we have got the Bournemouth boys. Creepy Junior unlucky not to score in gameweek 25. Um his ball striking is just absolutely incredible. And in terms of value for money, he is definitely a pick that is uh definitely proving some value there. So if you are, you know, you are Krooppy owner, you're not really looking at any other forwards right now. I think he's absolutely fine to keep. And to be fair, he's fine to play in each of the next four game weeks as So if you you're a Thiago and Krooppy Junior owner for example, you can bench Thiago in a game like 26 and you can play Krooppy instead. Evan Nilson's a really tough one. I think he was another player really unlucky in gameweek 25. Martinez had a really good game um for Aston Villa against Bournemouth in 25 and Evan Nilson had some real opportunities not just to score but also to assist. His underlying numbers are still very strong as you can see and the fixtures are decent. Um, however, obviously there has been a couple of blanks here and Evan Nlson being such a differential player may be a risky player to hold, but generally speaking, unless you have, you know, another forward who you're really keen on, all of these players in the monitor section, I would probably just look to keep Calbertt Lewen. Obviously, the fixtures in the next three are not ideal. Even Sunderland at 29, you may have a a different reading on that fixture and actually think that's a tough fixture as well, but his numbers are okay. He's cheap. is on penalties. There are some stills some things to like about Calbertt Lewin. I think the problem is a lot of these forwards um that we have in our teams right now are kind of average. So, you know, you have to kind of look at it. Is there another forward who you're really keen to get? If so, maybe some of these players could be sacrificed. But again, I wouldn't be rushing Calvin Leuen out the door unless you kind of needed to, unless you really really felt strongly about it. And in the cell category, I'm going to put Bowen here. Um the fixtures coming up are tougher. Um, Man United have been a strong defense recently as have uh Liverpool. Even Bournemouth are improving defensively as well. But here's the problem with Bowen. He has scored two goals in the last six game weeks, which looks great on paper, but one of them was a penalty and the other one was a cross that somehow found the back of the net. Um, so I would say that maybe Bowen has been a little fortunate in his returns. Of course, you were going to keep him against Burnley for the upside in that game, but now that that Burnley fixture is out the way, I think I would be much more comfortable selling Bowen because really his underlying numbers compared to a lot of the other forwards are pretty low. He's kind of the lowest on this list out of him and all of the players above him, as you can see on this list, just 1.5 xG. Considering he's played six games, one of those, well, most of that XG was the penalty that he took. It's kind of very difficult to kind of justify keeping him at 7.7 million. Well, Tomato with his continued rotation risk is going to continue to be a cell and Mateta some kind of long-term injury that he's got right now may require surgery. We'll find that out in the next couple of days. But it looks like he is going to be a player who is in the best case scenario like plays some games but is managed his minutes managed. Of course, Crystal Palace have signed a new striker who we will talk about today. So, I think Mateta is going to be a pretty straightforward sell because uh yeah, it looks like he is could be out really for the long term here into the midfield. Um, Declan Rice, did he blank in gameweek 25? It's up to you what you think a blank is. He did get defensive contributions and the clean sheet. So, a five-pointer for Rice. I don't know. It's kind of this the equivalent of a player getting an assist and no bonus point and no clean sheet, isn't it? So, it's not the end of the world. Uh, wasn't the worst score in the world. And I think we have seen recently that that Rice's creative numbers are really strong. 16 key passes, 1.67 expected assists. This is some of the highest numbers you'll see um from uh from a creative point of view um over the last few game weeks, over the last six really. So, I think Rice is still a really good pick. I definitely would not be looking to sell him or swap him for a different Arsenal player ahead of the double game week. So, he's going to be a really really straightforward keep for me even though some people are selling because they are a little bit uh maybe concerned about some of the blanks recently. But the data is there, the defcons are there, the double game week's there. No reason to sell. Um, but although I would maybe say gameweek 27, we could maybe reconsider that a little bit because maybe Rice has been playing a little bit deeper than usual recently, but that's just going to get you more Defcon. So, it's not, you know, there just different ways of looking at it. Still on those set pieces, so still going to have opportunities in that way. Rogers definitely going to be a keep. I know a lot of people have been worried about Rogers recently in gameweek 25 or ahead of gameweek 25. So many people were selling him. He was a Rogers was a keep last week. He's going to be a keep again this week. I think people maybe lost a bit of patience on Rogers and some people punished last game week and if you're still thinking about selling Rogers I think you could be punished even more because Aston Villa their fixtures are reasonably strong now in the next four gamew weeks really all the way up until gameweek 31 where they face West Ham in 31 where some people may even be thinking about captaining Rogers when kind of we see Arsenal and Man City with the blank gameweek in 31. Rogers could be your your captain actually. So, yeah, really a a hold all the way until gameweek 31. If you're a wild carding in 32, he's going to take you all the way up there um with plenty of returns, I'm sure, in this period. Enzo with a blank in gameweek 25, a disappointing one at that because he did perform really well in that game, at least from a u an analytical point of view, had some good opportunities to score. One in particular, created a huge chance for Netto towards the end of the game, which Netto completely whiffed. Um so, that was a bit of a shame. It's just a case of, you know, Enzo blanking for one week and I think maybe people lose patience, but the numbers are still good. Very good. In fact, you can kind of see this 2.65 xG, 1.29 XA. Really, really strong numbers here. Four big chances. Of course, there has been a penalty in there as well. And the next two fixtures, Leadeds and Burnley at home. Everything is looking pretty positive for Enzo. So, not a player I would really be looking to sell, although I wouldn't necessarily buy him either because if you are buying him, he is a pretty short-term pick. We have also seen from Cole Palmer that Cole Palmer is still not fully fit and he is still, you know, having to have his minutes managed somewhat, which means there will always be, you know, a period of the game where Enzo is the penalty taker because when Palmer isn't on the pitch, Enzo is the penalty taker and there are going to be moments when Palmer is off the pitch. So, there we go. We'll move on to Wilson in Monitor. The next two fixtures are pretty rough for him, but he's another player similar to Rogers where he's a really nice player to take all the way up to a gameweek 32 wild card. So, if you are planning on the wild card in gameweek 32, then he's definitely going to be a keep for you because we've got Burnley in gameweek 31. So, Wilson is going to be actually one of the best picks in gameweek 31 in a week where there's a lot going to be a lot of players missing. So, that's really nice. the next two game weeks. I'm hoping that owners can maybe bench him against Man City away, Sunderland away, may maybe Spurs at home. Not sure on that fixture. You never really know what you're going to get with Spurs, but I think Wilson is definitely playable at the very least against uh Spurs and arguably against Sunderland as well, but that has been a tricky away fixture for teams in the Premier League this season. Uh plenty of shots from Wilson. XG numbers pretty good. A little bit of an overperformance there in terms of goals, but an underperformance in terms of his creativity. no assists from 1.11 expected assists there. So that is uh maybe somewhere he can improve. But overall, as long as you can bench Wilson, I would keep him. If you can't, you know, that maybe does drop him down a little bit. So is an interesting one. I think we are going to see some rotation at some point, but I don't really know when it's going to be. The next few fixtures are good as we know for Man City. They do have some strong fixtures, but those with one eye on gameweek 31 will be thinking, you know, Semeno blank gameweek 31. Do I really want to keep him in the long term? Maybe not. If you're looking for a new midfielder, and I think to be fair, the the standard of midfielder, the kind of your expectations of what you should get from a midfielder should be very high right now because there are so many great midfield options. So, I think that does drop Semeno down into monitor. But a very low priority sell like I would only sell him again if if there's someone you really really like the look of. Kuna, I think, is where we start to get creep in a few more concerns. So has the concern of the blank gameweek coming up but aside from that looks good. Kuna the fixtures are good. He is getting FPL points but he is vastly overperforming here. Three goals and one assist from what's that 0.9 expected goal involvements or returns from 0.9 expected goal involvements. That is a big overperformance. Obviously, he scored a few worldy wonder goals recently, but one concern is he is getting substituted off a little bit early in games and he seems to be the first sub in every single game getting subbed off for Shesho and given that it seems to be working this kind of strategy from Michael Carrick and Manchester United. I do think that's going to continue. So, what is your expectation here? Are you expecting Kuna to continue to score like wonder goals in the kind of 60 70 minutes that he plays each game week? Maybe, maybe you are. Maybe that can happen and maybe he can improve his numbers too. That can happen too. The fixtures are certainly good enough for to to allow that to happen. But if we have very high standards of what we're expecting from midfielders right now, does Kuna quite cut the mustard? I don't know. That's going to be up to you. He is definitely a player we need to be keeping an eye on throughout this uh period whilst his minutes are reduced and while he's not getting those high xG chances and kind of high volume of chances either. And Jai is a really really uh disappointing one really. I had much higher hopes from him. Um I think we are maybe edging towards Anjai being a cell. Everton in attack maybe not completely clicking right now. Um obviously you know they scored a couple of goals against Fulham. Um but for a lot of that game they they they didn't look too good to be honest. Uh certainly in the first periods of the game they did not look great. And Jay is not really getting the opportunities that we'd hoped from him. He's had three game weeks now back since AFCON and he's barely mustered up any shots. three shots, two key passes. I'm just not sure this is good enough when we are we do have such a high standard of midfielder. So in that case, I feel enjoy is wandering towards the cell section at this point. And then we've got some players which who just are cells. So Foden is going to be a cell. Continued rotation risk and very expensive. Gordon, I think it's going to be very difficult to get any kind of real information about his injury status because Eddie How is a liar in his press conferences. And Bayio Saka looks like he is going to be out for at least the first game of the double game week and probably the second as well. And given that we do need to make sure we do have our three Arsenal players in place for the double game week. Saka is just going to be a cell. Let's check out some defenders guys. Chaloba first of all if you have him I think you got to keep him. Two game weeks really really nice couple of weeks for him here. I wouldn't necessarily buy Chalaba but for the next two you keep him. He has been one of the best defensive contribution defenders over this six gameweek period and I think that's probably going to continue into the next fixtures as well. So even if Chelsea do lose their clean sheets and they will lose the occasional clean sheet. We know that Chelsea are still conceding so many chances um you're still going to have defcon to back you up and you know leads at home burning at home even if you are a you know one of the weaker defenses in the league you're still going to have a chance in some of the more favorable fixtures whilst playing at home. So for the next two weeks, Chaloba, I think he is going to be an absolutely great keep from 28 onwards though, probably going to be a great sell. So Mark Gay is going to be the next player here. If you bought him at a cheap price, I would just continue to own him through this period of games. You are probably going to have to sell him by gameweek 31 because of that blank gameweek. But for the time being, I think he is going to be absolutely fine. Um, actually has had some opportunities to score uh well goals and assists recently, but hasn't quite come off. Defcon's a complete myth with him though. Not looking likely at all. Mukle, a player I would look to keep, would bench him for gameweek 26, but particularly again if you got him at a low price, I'll be looking to keep him and probably play him in that Fulham game. Maybe that leads game in 29 as well. Definitely going to be a really nice rotation option over the next period of games. Even if uh Liverpool in 26 isn't ideal. So no patience lost on Mukle quite yet. Collins is one to monitor. Now, if Collins had played in gameweek 25, if he had started, I would definitely put him in the keep section, but he's actually dropped into monitor. Now, you know, Arsenal next, I think you're probably going to, if he's playing, you're probably going to just bench him for this game week and then play him for some great fixtures that are coming up very soon for Brenford. But there is just this this uh kind of concern around is he like a first choice player for Brenford anymore. I think the answer is probably yes. He missed out gameweek 24 with a knock. Gameweek 25, I think, because the the center back pairing of Aya and Vandenberg did so well in gameweek 25 uh in 24, it was kind of kept on in gameweek 25. So, same two center backs. But with two goals conceded against Newcastle, I wonder if maybe we could see probably Vandenberg drop out and Collins come back in. Now, I think the good thing about Collins is the fact that you are going to probably bench him in 26 anyway. hopefully plan to bench him in 26 regardless. And if so, you're going to get one more week of information about whether he is going to continue to be or whether he's going to be the starting center back. I think he probably should be. There's been high praise around Collins from Andrews and I do think that he is probably first to us and he's, you know, he's the captain of the team as well. So, it's a really really interesting one. Um, difficult to get a read on it to be honest, guys. He's still an amazing defcon defender. when he plays, I think there's going to be great opportunities for clean sheets. If I knew he was nailed, I would love to have him for for the run after the Arsenal game. So, one to keep an eye on throughout the week, guys. Hopefully, we can get a better read on that very soon. Malik Chow. Um, yeah, maybe you are starting to think about selling Chiao right now. Um, even though I don't mind the Spurs fixture and I don't mind the Everton fixture in 28 either. It's 27 Man City, 29, Man United. Don't particularly love them. And it's just Newcastle just not keeping clean sheets right now. They're conceding way too many goals. 12 goals conceded in six game weeks. This is not good enough. Even though I mean look at these underlying numbers, man. 6.6 non-penalty expected goals against for Newcastle in this six gameweek period. And yet they've conceded 12. So unless they can start to regress to their mean or progress to their mean, I guess in terms of that that are those expected numbers versus the actual numbers, I'm worried about Newcastle defenders generally. And I'm worried that there's the fixes aren't good enough to justify keeping them. Maybe one to monitor. I think there are higher priority sales. Tarovski, for example, Everton are just not looking good defensively right now. The defensive contributions for Tarovski are seemingly, you know, lowering. They're going to getting gradually lower. And the next three fixtures, I don't really know if there's going to be any clean sheets in this run of fixtures. Particularly that Everson are just conceding so many chances. And maybe we don't even have Defcon to kind of back us up with Tarovski. I would be maybe more um more I don't know generous with Tarovski if he wasn't 5.8 million, but he is so expensive and I don't know if he's justifying it right now. Vanerven is going to be another monitor. Just pretty average fixtures generally here for Vanerven. So, uh yeah, maybe who could replace him, but at least he's a body. Rhys James probably going to be a cell given his he's his has an injury issue right now and the next fixture against Leeds is in just a couple of days time. Not sure if he's going to recover in time for that. Although I do think he will probably play against Burnley in 27 if he is uh back and available. But again, because the fixes after Burnley are so poor for Chelsea, you may as well sell him now, particularly at 5.7 million. Du continues to be a sell. Um, he is still out for what, probably 8 and 1/2 game weeks now. Or sorry, 8 and a half weeks. He's going to be out now since it was like 10 game weeks when he was originally injured. Or sorry, 10 weeks when he was originally injured. It's been a week and a half since his injury. Yeah, he's out for another eight and a half weeks. There you go. Romero three game, no, four game suspension, isn't it? Four game suspension for his second red card of the season. Terrible stuff, but yeah, definitely going to be a cell there if you do have him in your squad. By the way, guys, don't forget to like the video uh today and do subscribe if you want to follow along with these transfer tips every single game week. We've got some tight deadlines, but plenty of videos to come this week. Okay, let's go to forwards to buy. And again, I'm going to say a similar thing to uh kind of what I said last game week. I not really looking at many forward transfers right now, but some people will be in a situation where they kind of have to buy a forward or are desperate to buy a new forward. If so, Ekit I think looks good for the kind of medium term. So I think he is a player you can pick up now and just be confident with going forward all the way up until you know the gameweek 32 wild card or potentially even beyond that as well if even if you're not wild carding in gameweek 32. So he looks really strong at the moment. Great form, great underlying numbers. Fixtures I think are good enough particularly after gameweek 26. So a nice long-term option there. Jah Pedro not really so much of a long-term option. Next two gameweeks look great for him like genuinely really really good but after that Chelsea do have horrible fixtures. So, if you are looking for something ultra short-term, then maybe Joel Pedro is your guy. Maybe some rotation risk there. And it should be said, I know a lot of people look at his gameweek 25 score and think, \"Wow, he must have had an amazing game.\" He absolutely didn't. Um, he took like one shot, made no key passes whatsoever, super low xG, super low XA, came away with two assists because he won two penalties. Um, so he got a lot of points for doing very little. And as you can see on screen, guys, the underlying numbers aren't really there. To take seven shots in six game weeks is not ideal, particularly with two key passes. Seven shots. These are really low numbers, but the fixes are good. We have seen him be fairly clinical in recent uh gameweeks, which you might consider to be good form. Mane is the other player I'm going to put in the buy category here just because he has a double gameweek basically. But remember guys, if you buy Mane or indeed any Wolves player this week, you are probably well probably gonna have to transfer them out in gaming 31 when they do have a blank. So ultimately, if you're buying a Wolves player, you are spending two transfers on a Wolves player. One to bring them in this week and another to take them out next week. So you kind of have to factor that in if you are going for them. That said, Mar still looking good, taking set pieces, corners, free kicks, which is nice. Did hit the woodwork as well in game weeks 25. So maybe a little unfortunate not to get returns. And look, the numbers are good here in terms of the shot volume. These are good. You know, key passes, these are not bad, though. I don't mind Man\u00e9 at all for that value for money. Um, let's see what he can do in game 26. Now, the Forest are looking a little worse as we saw against Leads where they had a really poor performance. I'm kind of a bit feeling a bit more bullish about Man\u00e9 because we know a two-pointer is probably what's going to happen against Arsenal in the second of the double game. Right, Jockarez? Where do we rate him? um he's going to be a high monitor and I think really that the risk you take with Joarez is missing out on the other Arsenal guys. You're going to probably want to have double defense as a minimum from Arsenal across this double game. You're going to be picking one more guy. Is it going to be Declan Rice? Is it going to be a third Arsenal defender/goalkeeper? Is it going to be someone else or is it going to be Yarez? If you want to take a risk with Yarez, fair enough. There is some rotation risk there as we have seen benched again in game week 25. He did come off the bench and score a couple of goals and his form is improving with Saka out. We expect him to be the penalty taker as well. So there gen genuinely is some things to like about Yarez at the moment but it is risky. He's only taken again just like Joel Petro seven shots two key passes during this period. He's 8.7 million. At that kind of price you're probably going to be bringing him in in 26 and then selling him again in 27 because the value for money is not quite there. I do wonder if there maybe is some kind of play where you bring in Yokarez for one week and then move him to Echit next week or something like that could potentially work, but ultimately there are some risk factors with Jockz. If you're happy to take that on, I don't think it's the worst move in the world. I really really don't. And that's maybe I maybe wouldn't have said that a couple of weeks ago, but now I'm kind of open to the idea of a risky Jockarez differential. I think outside of, you know, your main guys, the defenders, your your Rya, your Declan Rice, outside of those guys, I think Yarez is my next favorite Arsenal pick. Certainly more so than any other of the non Rice midfielders. Um, to be honest, so yeah, put him high monitor, but the risk is sacrificing your other, you know, one of your other Arsenal players, I guess. Creeper Jr. could buy potentially if you would want to, if you're looking for something cheap, fixtures are reasonably good. Um, Strand Larsson is interesting as a differential if you fancy him to start some games. I think the fixtures are certainly good enough for Crystal Palace, particularly in the next two where he could get some returns here. We can't really speak much about his data. I'm interested to see how he plays uh today as I record this video to see if there is any promise there if he is even starting that is. Um, so it's going to be a really interesting one. Strand Larson and one to monitor at the very least. If you are going to go for him though, it probably needs to be this gameweek because Burnley at home, that's the money fixture. Havitz not as keen on this one compared to someone like Yokarez. I think Havz is still has some rotation risk particularly as he's just come back from injury. I think the first game in the double game week, I wouldn't be surprised to see Havz benched. Even though, you know, he's played pretty well in his time since returning from injury, not just in the Premier League, but in other competitions as well. But I think the risk there is just too high for me particularly as he might not even be playing as a striker. If Joz is in good form playing as the striker, is he going to be playing in midfield or is it going to be someone else? Erdigard or um or potentially I'm not exactly sure because obviously Erdigard has some injury issues too. So too much mystery, too much confusion, and the fact that he's a forward who probably won't play as a forward puts me off a little bit as well. Avoid Calbertt Lewen. Fixtures just are not good enough to buy him right now. Same with Bowen. And as always guys, we are going to put all Brenford players in the avoid section this week. That includes Dango. I know you guys will be looking at Dango this week. Um, I will definitely be talking about Brenford guys from gameweek 27 as potential buys, but you just don't buy players against Arsenal. It's like the cardinal sin of FPL. If a players are about to play Arsenal, you don't buy them. Doesn't mean you sell them, but you definitely don't buy them. Onto our midfielders. And guys, I'm actually genuinely going to put Bruno Fernandez ahead of Rice in the double gameweek. Even though yes, we have um technically we do have Rice with a double gameweek and Bruno uh with the non-double game week. I guess still, man, I it's just it's just Bruno is just so on it right now. He looks so good right now. He looks like such a good pick right now that he's so difficult to justify going without him. So much so that I think that Bruno in a single game week probably outscores Rice on a double gameweek. Maybe that's controversial, maybe it's not, but that's kind of how I feel about Bruno right now. Um maybe could have got even more in gameweek 25 to be honest. I mean, Shesho missed an enormous chance in the last second of the game, which would have been a Bruno assist. Um yeah, it's just looking too good with Bruno right now. And he's such a good captain every week as well. probably not in gameweek 26 because of the double game week and we will talk about um double gameweek captains and indeed triple captains in this week's video. So make sure you stay tuned for that one. Um but ultimately yeah Bruno is just essential right now. Can't say any more than that. Declan Rice is um also going to be a very obvious buy this week. You know if you're looking for a new midfielder you need a third Arsenal player. Rice is just so obvious. Good for Defcon. Still still on all those set pieces which is always going to be, you know, several routes to points as always. Taking long shots as well. Took a good long shot in game at 25. Could have been a goal. Wasn't on this occasion. And Florian Vertz is another player I like the look of. I'm not fully convinced by this Sunderland away fixture, but in general over the next kind of period of games, I really do like the idea of Berts. I did put him pretty low on the on last week's episode of of buy keeper void. I do kind of regret that. I am recording this video before the Man City game, but I do think that maybe Vertz could do well in that Man City game. I guess again, you guys might know by the time you've watched this how well Vertz does in that game. But regardless, as long as he doesn't get injured, he has got to be a player that we are keeping an eye on. And I I I probably did underrate him last game. Yeah, I guess that's just because our standard of midfielder is just so high right now. So yeah, definitely on the cards and I think the fact that Forest is looking like a slightly better fixture as well now I think has definitely improved the these uh Liverpool players in terms of our rankings. Palmer. Wow. Okay, we need to talk about him. 20 points in game mix 25. People will be clamoring over him understandably so. But let's just kind of maybe calm down a little bit because although he is a good buy because his ceiling is very high, there are some very obvious downsides to him as well. First of all, game week 25 where he did get his big return, it was two penalties. Like like any penalty taking player who has two penalties awarded to them in one game is going to look good in that one game. I mean people thinking about selling Eagle Thiago if he happen to get two penalties in one game, no one would be talking about it, would they? So it does maybe warp our perception a little bit on players. Now penalty takers are amazing to own. Of course they are. But, you know, I think it maybe looks like the gameweek 20 the gameweek uh score of 20 points was was obviously amazing, but it looks maybe a bit better than the performance was because it was two penalties if that makes sense. So, realistically, still very good, but maybe not as good as it looks, if that makes sense. We've also seen that Palmer is not fully fit. He's kind of come out in an interview and said, \"Yeah, I'm I'm just not fully fit right now essentially.\" And beyond gameweek 27, the fixtures are really rough for Chelsea. So, if you're looking for a high upside short-term differential, I guess, then yeah, Palmer could be your guy, but it is not without its risks and he is almost certainly a transfer back out from gameweek 28 onwards. Rogers is also going to be in this conversation. You could arguably put Rogers ahead of Palmer because Rogers is such a nice kind of medium-term hold all the way up until gameweek 31. Definitely would still be considering him, although his underlying data is maybe maybe leaves a little bit to be desired. At least he's taking plenty of shots. Sar is an really interesting pick. I'm curious to watch him today to see how he does. But Burnley and Wolves in the next two fixtures. If he's continuing to be the penalty taker, then we've got to like the look of this, haven't we? Getting plenty of chances to score big chances as well during his limited time since returning from AFCON. I think if you're looking for a cheap midfielder, he's probably where I'd be looking to go at this exact moment. Semeno is also going to be a monitor. There are is obviously some advantages of these nice fixtures coming up, but could there be rotation risk? Are you kind of walking yourself into a transfer out in gameweek 31? Yes, you probably are. But you could say the same thing about Ismile, who's also going to be blanking in gameweek 31 as well. I regret to inform you that Bruno G is going to be in the avoid section. I just it's so difficult to justify him as an FBL pick, although he is the penalty taker now apparently, especially in Gordon's absence. So, there's that. Um, but really outside of that, I think the fixtures are not really quite good enough. They're kind of average at best. I think Man City away and Manchester United at home are difficult fixtures and Spurs and Everton, I don't know, maybe somewhere in the middle probably slightly good fixtures, but maybe not amazing. So overall, um, yeah, when there are so many other midfielders performing right now who look genuinely good, whether that's just through penalties or, you know, from their overall play, I just don't really see how Bruno fits in when, you know, our standard is so high. The fixtures are not amazing here. the their the underlying data I don't think is is is incredible necessarily. And are you relying on penalties with him a little bit? I don't know. It's really difficult, guys. I'm going to have to put him in a void just cuz just by by virtue of there being better picks out there right now. But uh if you disagree, fair enough. Somerville, I think the fixtures are not again not good enough for West Ham going into these upcoming game weeks. So even though Somerville has been doing amazingly in such good form right now, just don't think this is the moment to buy him with Manchester United and Liverpool in the next three, Dardo would also look to avoid may have picked up an injury in gameweek 26 which um could limit his minutes uh sorry picked up an injury in gameweek 25 which could limit his minutes in gameweek 26. I think he's was already such a high-risk player, high-risisk pick. Don't think I'd go there. And defenders, pretty much Arsenal defenders. any of these guys, Gabrielle and Timber are your priority ones. But if you want to go for Celiba, I think that is also okay if you're maybe looking to go for a triple up or you can't quite afford uh some of the other guys. Um but Gabrielle, you know, I probably take a minus four to get Gabrielle in the team to be honest. Like he is so so crucial for this game week to be totally honest with you guys. Outside of that, Califuri, Hin Capier, other guys I think maybe a little too risky for me. So, it's really just these three Arsenal defenders I would be looking at. So, not so much Calif Fury to be honest. You're going to have to be a real risk taker to go there and just not comfortable recommending that in a video like today. James Hill, the new cheat code of FPL. Great fixtures coming up 3.9 million and has actually been one of the best defconers of recent gameweeks as well. 70 defensive contribution points. only one player and that's a strike at uh or stra at Leads uh is the only player to get more defcons than Hill in the last six game weeks which is crazy crazy stuff. So second best in that regard um and the fixtures are good and he's cheap. Yeah, I think Bournemouth are improving defensively as well. Their numbers are trending um towards a in a positive direction. I think this is a good pick even better than Sessi potentially. I don't know if you are factoring in value for money, I think Hill is a better pick than Senessi, but both good because the fixtures are just good for Bournemouth, particularly from a defensive point of view. Um, I think Crystal Palace fixtures are are good from a defensive point of view as well, particularly in the next two. And I would be hoping for some clean sheets here, despite Crystal Palace's poor uh recent form. Rich is the defcon guy, but if you're willing to spend a little bit more money, 5.8 million mono is going to be uh definitely an interesting option to go for as well. But I think Riches at 4.4 4 million because he is so uh cheap because he is safe getting regular defensive contributions. He's maybe the more sensible of the two picks. Dalow is also going to be in the monitor section. You could go for him potentially. The fixes are pretty decent here for him. Um but defensive contributions just don't really happen for him. Pretty rare. Um maybe do have some attacking threat there. Um but yeah, he's kind of an interesting one. Not really my kind of defender, but I I kind of I I see the vision in him. I see the vision. Would definitely look to avoid Kuka. know defcon 6 million so really expensive and really I don't even know if leads at home is a great fixture for a defender leads score goals man they really really do um Burnley after that is is you know very good for Kuka but after that fixture is terrible so I think if you're looking to buy Chelsea defenders you've probably left it a little bit too late at this point you should have done it before and actually from here on there are players that are you know just as good over the next two game weeks and beyond that much much better Mark Gayhee if you haven't already got him don't think I'd be looking to buy him now necessarily and Mukle not the greatest week to buy him ahead of that Liverpool fixture. And let's wrap up with some goalkeepers guys. Um yeah, obviously you're going to keep Rya ahead of the double game week in 26. Got a bonus point in gameweek 25 which was really nice. Couple of saves there for him as well. Um if you got Sanchez would also be looking to keep him for the next two game weeks and then we can kind of reassess at that point. If you're looking to sell a goalkeeper, maybe Pigford is the only goalkeeper I maybe be looking to sell just because Everton just seem to be, you know, getting worse defensively, which is a little worrying there. Um, but, you know, even that, I mean, I'm never convinced by any goalkeeper transfers to be honest, unless it's a player like Cells who is kind of injured right now or a player who is like not playing regularly. If you're looking to buy a new goalkeeper, Rya is a really obvious one. I still believe Rya is, you know, the best goalkeeper pick in the game. um which is kind of backed up by um all of the clean sheets and it's the double game week right now is just a good time to jump on if you haven't if you're looking for a new goalkeeper right now you haven't got your triple Arsenal sorted maybe the way to get your triple Arsenal it's just just go very simple go for David Rya um we got Jose Sa maybe as a potential alternative here as well again I'm not too super convinced by this one but I think you could definitely potentially go for Jose S because of the uh just the fact that um you know going to get a double game week. I think some of the fixtures are okay. I think he is playable in some fixtures. Maybe could work as as a rotation goalkeeper at 4.2 million. Maybe you could hide him on your bench in gameweek 31. Um because he's obviously a goalkeeper. If your other goalkeeper does have a fixture in gameweek 31, like even if it's Dravka, then you know maybe that could work that way as well. Um Wolves are improving defensively. I know they conceded, you know, a whole bunch of goals against Chelsea, but you know, penalties are going to make score lines look a lot worse. And then for avoid, don't think I would be buying Sanchez at this point and Pigford I definitely wouldn't be buying at this point in the season. But that's pretty much all the players we've got today. We covered so much. But as always guys, there's always more players that we miss because we can't talk about every player in the Premier League. So if there's any player I didn't mention in today's video, let me know in the comments section and we'll give them a rating, a buy, sell, keep, or avoid. And I'll try and give some justification in some of the comments as well. So let me know in the replies guys. Drop a like guys. Do subscribe. We are got to be locking in because the new deadline is upon us so so soon. So plenty of videos to come this week guys. Looking forward to sharing them with you and I will see you later mates. Bye-bye.",

[music] >> [music] >> Hello. There's there's a a square on my face right now, apparently. Um, hang on. I'm just tweeting out the stream. Uh, gameweek 25. Game 25, right? Gameweek 25. Okay. Hello. Hello. Let's remove this square from my face. We don't need this. We don't need this. Hello everyone. How are we all today? I hope you're all well. It is gameweek 25 deadline day and a Friday deadline, no less. So, I hope you guys have not told your your colleagues, your mini league rivals, your friends about this uh this Friday deadline in hopes that they will forget. What shirt is this? Well, this, my friend, is a Costa Rica special. Um, it was going to be the Costa Rica um World Cup shirt for this year. Um, but yeah, that's what uh that's what we're we're rocking today. Always rocking a new shirt. It's got to it's got to be done. The jersey collection continues to spiral really out of control. I mean, it it's not they're not just on the rail anymore. I mean, I'm not going to show this part of the room because it's a mess, but it's just piles and piles of football shirts at this point. Really quite crazy. There there is organization to to the madness, though. Uh, there really is. Um, but regardless, hello everyone. Hello everyone. Um, I need to make a transfer today. I don't know about you guys, um, but I've not quite locked in my transfers, but um, that will be done in today's stream. What's my favorite shirt? It's got to be that one. There's got to that's got to be my favorite shirt. That's why it's there, to be honest. That's why it's there to be honest. Um, but yeah, let me uh let me catch you guys up on where I am at in terms of my team. Uh just find the tab and get that correct and zoom out a little bit so it's clear as day. Okay. Right. This, my friends, is where we're at. Well, as you'll see in a second. There we go. Right. So, haven't made the sack transfer yet. He will be going for Declan Rice. Declan Rice will be uh will be coming in and uh that will be me done because I only have one free transfer. So, I'm not going to go too crazy with it this week as there's not really much point. Um and I'm pretty happy to just go fairly straightforward this week. Uh Kong with a super chat nice and early in the stream today. Morning Dan. Thoughts on Gabrielle Captain? Um I think he's probably my second favorite after Bruno. I think there's like for me Bruno is my favorite captain and I kind of have three second favorites but maybe there's a little bit of a gap there. Uh and the three second favorites are probably Gabrielle, Ecat, and Bowen. I'd maybe maybe throw in and Burmo there as well. Um so yeah, something like that. Something like that is is probably what I would do. Um, if I'm looking for an alternative captain, which includes Gabrielle, but honestly, if you have Bruno, is it the week to be silly? Is it the week to go differential? I don't know. I don't know. I'm not thinking about Palmer. No, I'm not, Reesei. I'm not thinking about Palmer really. Uh, still still just not totally convinced by his minutes or indeed his performances. I don't I know people said like the other week he got two assists, but I watched that game. The two assists were like pass to a teammate and they run all the way down the field and score from 40 yards. It's like sideway sideways pass for the uh the striker to score a wonder goal. So, I don't know. Uh I'm just not really seeing the vision with Palmer at the moment. His form has just not been there. And to be honest, I'm probably one of the people who really really I'm I'm not buying the hype on Chelsea players this week. I mean, I'm I'm an Enzo owner, and honestly, once Rice is in this midfield, I'm probably expecting Enzo to probably score the least amount of points of any of my attackers because Wolves away, I just don't think this is an amazing fixture for anyone, you know, let alone a Chelsea team that's just played kind of midweek and played loads of games recently. Um, so I don't know, man. I don't know. FBL Joe says, \"People saw a green F mob score on Palmer in that game and assumed 2024 Palmer was back.\" This is what I'm saying. It's um it's nostalgia, isn't it? It's a little bit nostalgia. Palmer's just not in the right moment. He needs to have his surgery probably will happen after the World Cup and then um hopefully he can get back to his best, but for for right now, you know, we're talking about Sacka being bad, but for money, Palmer is just another sacker as far as I'm concerned. I don't really want to get trapped there. Um, and I don't think Wolves Wolves have really improved defensively. Like, look through the recent Wolves games and we'll just show you. We'll just show you the recent Wolves results. Actually, should we just go on FOMO? Let's do mob. Speaking of FOMO, um, so they're not actually really conceding that many goals and indeed that many chances either. So, we can go through their some of their form. Just go back a page. It's going to take us all the way back. All right. So, um, let's, uh, let's look pretty. So, two goals conceded to Bournemouth, two to Man City. Not too surprising. They're two good attacks. Um, nil nil against Newcastle. Uh, one goal conceded to Everton, none to West Ham, one to Manchester United, two to Liverpool, two to Brenford, two to Arsenal. It's not really since the 8th of December, which is two months ago, that Wolves have actually got battered by anyone. Like, I'm not saying they're a good team. like they're not. But like I think a lot of people look at Wolves at the bottom bottom of the table and and think, \"Oh, this Wolves side is um we got Opter as well. Um they look at this Wolves side at the bottom of the table and assume like this is the best fixture a team can possibly have right now.\" And it's just not. I think there are several teams I'd rather play as an attacker right now than Wolves. Um, let's just go 10 gameweek data on defensive defensive fantasy football hub. We'll zoom in a little bit. Um, and kind of look at the non penalty expected goals uh allowed non- penalty goals against Wolvesa here 12.3. Um, so basically conceding just over one xG non-penalty per game. It's look, I'm not saying this is a bad fixture, but it's it's not a bad fixture. It's a good fixture, but it's not Burnley. Uh I think Burnley or worse. I think Bournemouth for worse. I I think I'd rather play, you know, Bulham at home would be a better fixture than Wolves away. Everton at home would be a better fixture than Wolves away. Sunland at home is a better fixture than Wolves away. Crystal Palace at home is better than uh Wolves away. Brighton home or away is better. West Ham home or away is probably better. Leads home or away is probably better. So, I think it's an okay fixture, but is it so good that you know, like I'm seeing people go, \"Okay, we need to get Palmer. We need to get Joel Pedro. This is this is Wolves. This is an amazing fixture.\" Is it is it It's all right. It's all right. But Joel Pedro captain like I I honestly I think the only reason we're seeing Hang on this picture a picture of Jal Pedro being brought in by over 700,000 managers. This will hit 750,000 by the time we get to deadline easy. Maybe even 800. Um, the only reason we're seeing so many people brought by Jah Pedro, I mean obviously because he scored points recently, that always helps, but because people see Wolves as the bottom of the table and say that is the fixture I want. I would be more inclined to captain a Chelsea player against, you know, Leicester, oh sorry, Leadeds and Burnley. Not that you not that you probably will because obviously 26 is a double, but um it's it's an okay game. Like I'm not I don't have the same, you know, FOMO on Jal Pedro as a lot of other people seem to have. Like so many, you know, looking through YouTube comments and stuff like that, a lot of people seem really, really keen to get Jo Pedro in kind of at any cost. And I just don't see the vision. Like I think Ecat is a better pick this week than e than uh than Pedro for example. Um I think over the over the medium term I think Thiago is a better pick than than Juel Pedro and the odds kind of reflect that as well. Um so these are the bookmaker odds. Rob T um posted these yesterday and you know Shah Pedro he is there. He's in the conversation. 0.38 projected goals there. But like we've got Eatique, Raal, Watkins, Thiago, Evan Nilson, you know, if we're just looking at forwards, Whistard, Calbertt Leuen, Harland, Yokarez, all of these players are, you know, have better odds this week. And I don't think that will be the same next week. I think Sha Pedro will have better goalcoring odds in gameweek 26. But then maybe you say, okay, midweek, gameweek, is there some rotation risk? Maybe, maybe not. Um, you know, can he still do some damage off the bench? Absolutely. Um, gameweek 27 against Burnley. Amazing for Jo Pedro. Really like that as well. But this week, eh, oh, sorry, bang my uh my mic. Um, yeah, it's like, yeah, he's all right. He's an okay pick. Not going to break I'm not going to break my team for him. Certainly not going to captain him. Probably wouldn't even make my top 10 captains this week to be honest. Thumbnail says gameweek 24. Oh, does it? Well, then that's that's uh unintentional. Wait, did I not make a new thumbnail? I thought I did. Thank you for that. That is actually useful. Uh oh, yeah, I'm using last week's thumbnail for some reason. Let me resolve that because um that is incorrect. Thank you for flagging that Farath. We're meant to have a nice Bruno Fernandez on the thumbnail as well, not Joel Pedro. Speaking of Hey, maybe it was uh written in the stars there a little bit to talk about Joel Pedro. Will Harland start? Uh yeah, I don't see why he wouldn't. I don't see why he wouldn't. I mean, it's like a pretty big game for Man City, a must-win game. Every game's a must-win game, but um you know, it's it's a it's an enormous game for uh for Manchester City, and I just cannot see them not playing their best striker. And and I appreciate Marmush been in good form. Maybe there is a way to play both of those guys, but nah, surely let's be let's be real. I don't see a reason why Harland would be benched any more so than anyone else. Like anyone could be benched in any game. You just don't know. But Pep said he don't doesn't know if Harland will start. Has Pep ever known if any of his players will start? Be interested to find the exact quote. Uh what a Pep Guardiola press. Actually, we'll find it on X, can't we? Um, what's that Man City Extra? So, what have they said? Uh, Anton Semeno stuff. What's the exact quote here? Lots of Anton Cherokee. Mark Gay. By the way, even Mark Gayhee, I think, is at some risk because Ruben Dash is back now and John Stones is back in training. So, Mark Gay probably good for now, but you know, you never know when that rotation could begin. The only quote I saw on Harland earlier was that Pep said like something like, \"Oh, he's the best striker in the world.\" Or something like that. Uh, okay. So, he said he doesn't know if Bernardo is available. I can't see anything about Harland here. Uh, yeah. Oh, here we go. Whether Harland automatically starts um Erling is the best strike in the world. I don't know. We'll decide tomorrow. Always I say Erling is the best. Okay. Yeah, that's kind of what I saw. That doesn't really suggest to me that he doesn't know if Harland is available or anything like that. It's just like I haven't picked my lineup yet. I'm not telling you my lineup. So, uh yeah, that's all that that says to me. Yeah, Harland stars like just as likely as as any other player. Not something I'm worried about. Uh should I start Lewis Potter? I mean, yeah, you you could definitely uh play Lewis Potter. I think he could be interesting this week. Could be really interesting. Any update on Watkins? Yes. Yes. Actually, um he's going to be in the squad apparently. Whether that means he's going to start or not is maybe a slightly different question, but it's looking positive. It's looking fairly optimistic on on Watkins and his availability. So, um yeah, I guess uh positive. Don't think I'd be selling necessarily. Uh should I sell Harland? No, I mean I I will answer all Harland related questions at once. Don't sell him, but don't captain him either. Like I know people will want to sell him anyway. And if you really want to sell Harland, who am I to stop you? Who am I to stop you? But it's not something that is even remotely entering my mind um at all. Like particularly if you're selling Sacka, like you've just freed up a whole bunch of money by selling Sacka. Do you really need to free up even more money by selling Harland? What are you even going to spend that money on? Like as bad as you think Harland might be, he's not he's no worse than I don't know, whoever you would replace him with. He's, you know, he's better than Joel Pedro. is better than Thiago right now. I don't know. Eat Salah. I mean, you could do you could sell Harland to get Salah in, but I I feel like the other the other kind of meta point is and Harland and and Salah, I don't really see there being too much difference in their form, particularly right now. Um, there's far more midfielders to go for right now than there are forwards. Like I'm bringing in Rice this week and I'm thinking, \"Oh man, how am I going to get in Verts? How am I going to get in Rogers? How am I get going to get in Wilson? Um maybe Dango at Brenford in a couple of weeks, too.\" I'm looking at so many different midfielders and I only have five slots and I'm thinking, man, this is frustrating. Um so how are you going to fit in Salah in there as well? I have no idea. I have no idea. And then you got players like Anderson and Enzo who are performing well at a cheap price. Got cheap defenders doing very well. Where are you going to spend the money? Bruno G starts. Um I don't know. Uh he's looking reasonably positive. He has been in training and I think because Lewis Miley is unavailable, I think that does improve Bruno G's chances. So, I will say maybe a cautious maybe a cautious yes. Maybe. Um, yes, comedy addict. We did already discuss it. I'm sure we'll talk about it again later. But what do I think of Pep's comments on Harland? I feel absolutely nothing. I am reading absolutely nothing into it whatsoever. All we could gather from that is that Pep doesn't know. Well, Prep is unwilling to reveal what his starting lineup is going to be, and he's undecided, and he's going to decide tomorrow because the game is on Sunday. So, why would he have decided his lineup today 100%. He of course he hasn't. So, he all the Pep has done is state the obvious and refuse to reveal who he's starting uh on Sunday. And why would he give up that that tactical advantage? Why would he imagine giving a definitive answer on whether Erling Harland will start or not? two days before a game of football against Liverpool when Liverpool would have all you know all ways to prepare in uh in different ways for the game depending on whether if they had definitive information of whether Harland is or isn't starting would would be ridiculous for Pep Guardiola to answer in any other way than the way in which he did answer. It would be ridiculous. So, uh yeah, no read into it whatsoever. None. [laughter] None at all. Um, what we got here in the chat then? Um, I went sack to Rogers comments. Uh, yeah, it's fine. It's fine. Rogers maybe not in the best form right now, but I think that can pick up soon. I think that could pick up soon. Wild card draft. Uh, the best wild the best thing to do about wild card is probably not wild card. >> [snorts] >> Yeah, Jamie's just sold Rogers for Enzo. Yeah, lot of people selling Rogers actually. I saw that. Like most transfers out for this round. Rogers is in. What's that? One, two, three, four, five, six. I think there's going to be a lot of regret for some players here. Thiago. I'm I want people to keep selling Thiago because I want his price to keep dropping so I can buy him in 27 or 28 because I am going to be buying Thiago and I'm going to enjoy owning Thiago as well. Um, so people want to keep selling him, go for it. Reduce his ownership, reduce his price. We will enjoy it. Bowden makes sense. I think Sacka makes sense. I think Bruno G makes sense to sell. Watkins, you know, kind of on the fence on that one. Rogers, I don't get get him as as a cell. These are good fixtures. Bournemouth, Brighton, leads, Wolves, Chelsea at home is decent. Man United is tough. West Ham at home is nice. So, there's lots of really nice fixtures here all the way up until like you can argue to save for the end of the season really. Um, so yeah, I think that I think there will be some Thiago selling regrets unless people buy him back in after, of course. I think there'll be some Rogers selling regrets. I think there'll be some Harland selling regret. Um, it's not the worst week for Calbertt Lew either at home against Forest. You could do worse. And Declan Rice being sold. I mean, I've been keeping an eye. The reason I haven't made an early transfer this game week is because there's just been absolutely no risk of Declan Rice rising in price because people see his blanks recently and assume that he's terrible. Now, Jeremy says, \"I loved Rogers at 5.5 million.\" I loved him at 5 million, man. Crazy. What a crazy buy he was. Is DCL a buy or a sell? It's neither. He's a don't buy, don't sell. If you have him, keep him. If you don't have him, don't buy him. Strand Lson going to start? That's a good question. I I really I'm I'm struggling to answer that one. I it's a it's a it's a coin toss situation I think. Should I buy Timber? I I I would feel reasonably confident on Timber. I I have seen a few questions regarding Timber. So the latest on Yuran Timber is that he has indeed uh been out of training this week. So he didn't train on was it Thursday? Wednesday or Thursday? He didn't train. Um and presumably that is just load management because apparently there's no injury there or anything like that. So there's no injury problem with uh with Pedro which is pos with jurian timber. So yeah, um I think it should be I think it should be fine uh to well it's certainly fine to start him if you're still a little bit worried and I think there is every chance that there is a rotation a resting for Timber this game week. Yeah, there's a small chance um a chance that is large enough to take note of, but it's far more likely that he he starts than doesn't start, I think, still. So, I'm not worried about Timbers's minutes necessarily. But I think if you're trying to look for a tiebreaker of whether you should buy Timber or or or Rice, if it's a head-to-head between Timber and Rice, who you're going to buy, maybe that can be a tiebreaker. But yeah, maybe that depends on your team structure and other things. What are your thoughts on Chucky? Um, I mean, you would you probably wouldn't want him for this game week against Liverpool. Uh, there's going to be some rotation risk with a midweek gameweek as well. I think I'd probably be looking to towards selling him if I had him just because I don't think he's worth the trouble. Why does no one talk about Celiba? um because he doesn't really do anything. He doesn't get defensive contributions. He doesn't take shots. He has no uh creativity. He's, you know, kind of capped. He doesn't get bonus points either. He's kind of capped at six points. So, you know, just go for Rya. Just go for Rya. There's so many great defcon defenders who are cheap or or you know goalc scoring defenders as well, bonus point magnets defenders that using one of your defender slots on Civa I don't know I don't know if you're going to triple up on the Arsenal defense I think the best way to do that is Rya Gabrielle Timber most likely because at least Timber does have some attacking threat and that may have not been reflected in the points But um you know when you watch the games you can see Timber is and and looking at the data as well. Timber's got some uh attacking online data whereas um it's just non-existent for um for I'll show you. So let's go Arsenal defenders. We'll go full season. How many shots has each defender taken? So, in 20 games this season, Celiba has taken three shots. That is monstrously low. He's got He's taken three shots. He's got defensive contribution points once [snorts] and he's picked up four bonus points total. So, he's a sixpoint merchant. He really is. So yeah, if you think Califuri is is maybe a little risky for me, it's Timber and Gabrielle really. These are the these are the defenders we're looking at. Timber shooting shooting numbers here is pretty good throughout the season. Uh and his key passing numbers are good as well. Oh, I say good. They're okay. They're okay. Free hit team. Oh, if you if you've got your free hit active right now, don't do do not confirm it. Cancel it. However bad you think your team might be this week, um surely it's not worth a free hit here. Should we talk about some chips for a second here? Scott says he's due a fourth shot. Yeah, quite possibly is due a fourth shot. So, what's that? That's one shot every like eight games, something like that. Seven get seven, eight games. That's That's wild. Uh Lisa Sn with the uh super chat here. Timber in, Collins out. Got Gabrielle and Rice. I mean, yeah, Collins could depend potentially go. It depends what your other defenders are. The one thing about Collins that is worth noting. I do have Collins in my squad is that he does look pretty good from gameweek 27, 28 onwards. So, Brian at home, very playable. Burnley away. You got to play him. um argument to play him against Bournemouth because I think that's a good defcon game. You're going to play him against Wolves, possibly going to play him against leads. If you wild carding in 32, maybe that is more motivation to sell because some of his better games are after gameweek 32. But really, I think if you can hold off two weeks, there's a lot of very playable games for Collins. So, it depends if you need uh if you need something now or you need something kind of soon, I guess. Is Virgil a good pick? He's not great for this game week, I guess. But, uh I would be happy to to start him, I guess. Do we get reason why he was benched on the bench last week? Yes, we did, Scott. We did. So, basically, Collins had like a minor um training ground cut. He got he picked up a cut in in training, I believe, and he needed stitches. Um, and just because they didn't really want to disrupt the stitches too much, um, they put him on the bench and kind of went, you know, we want your stitches to heal. We'll throw you on the pitch only if we desperately need you. And with with 10 men and and uh and only one goal up, they ended up needing Collins to to sub him on off off the bench. But yeah, they were they were making an effort to not play Collins in that game because of his stitches. But yeah, just a minor thing. You know, anyone who's had stitches before um will know that, you know, you need to kind of limit your movement for a couple of days maybe and then after that you're pretty much fine. So, um no concern really about um future minutes as far as Collins is concerned. just one of those things. Just one of those unfortunate things that can happen and a minor unfortunate thing as well. So, no biggie, no big deal. So, I think he's fine to keep um in that in that sense and and in the sense that the fixtures look good soon, too. And he's really good for Defcon. One of the best Defcon defenders in the league. I think he's going to be a handy pick. A very handy pick. Should we do a captain poll? I want to get an early idea on what you guys are thinking about captain. Um, comedy addict here says, \"Damn, mate. Did you see Gordon go down holding his left leg and then limp limp off holding his right?\" Oh, no. I didn't see that. I assumed it was a an actual injury. He is injured, isn't he? He's got a It's a hamstring issue, isn't it? Did see the press conference notes earlier. Right. Okay. We're going to do a captain poll. I'm not sure who to put in the poll. So, what I want you guys to do is just type in the chat who you're captaining and I'll get an idea from that who are the most popular captains and we'll throw the most popular ones in a poll and then you guys can get to vote in. So guys, if you would mind throw in the chat who you're captaining this week. So, who we got? We've got Bruno Fernandez, of course. Uh, I haven't seen Harland Joel Pedro maybe. Seems mostly Bruno. Might be a landslide. This one. Har and Joel Pedro I'm seeing. And Gabrielle, unless anyone else pops up. Uh, someone's saying Rice. I'm not really seeing the vision on that one. Once one, a couple of people said in Burmo, Bruno has one. Oh, yeah. Oh, Bruno has won this poll without a shadow of a doubt. But I am interested to see who comes second. Um, right. So, I put I put the question the poll question is going to be who is the best gameweek 26 captain and just pick out of the options. If you think it's someone else, fair enough. Just pick your favorite out of these four. We can talk on and on and on about differential captains, but um I don't think we really need to Martinelli because he looks like Dan. It's been a while since anyone said I look like Martinelli to be fair. It's been a little while. Um, okay. But there we go. Polls in the chat now. If you guys want to vote and we'll we probably know Bruno's one. Uh, I'm curious to see how many of you guys are going different and if so, where are you going different? That's that's uh the big big question. Hello here for FPL. Welcome versus Dravka. I think I probably backfa sorry uh like trying to think realistically this week who would I actually bench for Dravka out of the main goalkeepers. Maybe this is a job for the bench list. I did want to save the bench list. I try and I do try and save the bench list as late as possible. Um but it would seem that um let's just get let's just let's set up a little set up a little um for us there. Right. Who would I not start this week? Okay. I'm just You know what? I'm going to leave this for now. I'm just going to do goalkeepers. Let's throw on screen. So, let's just do goalkeepers for now and we'll try and figure out who would we actually bench ahead of. I I can't see a world in which um West Ham don't score. So I'm not expecting a clean sheet in this game for Nebraska. So let's think about this logically. Obviously you're going to play Rya. So we can put Rya at the top. Then you're going to play you're going to play Vugan. I think Crystal Palace is just it's a good fixture. You're going to play Pigford. Sorry, Sanchez and Pigford. Actually, you're going to play Sanchez. You're going to play Pigford. Are you going to play Kellah? That's where it gets a little questionable. That's close. Petravvic Petravich is maybe where it goes the other way. Um, does anyone have Donnaruma? Donnaruma, you probably bench this week. Super chat here from Taster or Tyster says, \"Hi Dan, one pick for Tera Lefeta Anderson or two Nunez.\" Nunez Darwin Nunez. Oh, right. Man City Nunes, Nunes to Timber, Lefay to Anderson or three Pigford to Rya, Nunz to Hill, Lefay to Kuna. I don't think we need to make a triple transfer here. Um, the most sensible one is probably Nunes to Timber Lefto Anderson because that way you're you're not adding a game 31 Blanca cuz Pigford is nice cuz you know Pigford's perfectly playable in gaming 31. Although if you have to brava backup goalkeeper is pretty fine as well. Um yeah, I think I would probably lean towards number two. Although there's definitely an argument to say that number one is the safer bet, but I think I'd do number two out of those. Yeah, let's go with two. Cool. All right. Um other goalkeepers on here, you want Pope, you want Ruffs. So Ruffs goes to the bottom. There's no doubt about that. you're not you're not going to want to play roofs or any indeed any Sunderland player this week really. Um and then Lammonds was the other one I saw mentioned in the chat. We got Pford on there already. Lmons I think is maybe a little bit better than some of these guys. Probably better than Kalaha. So like that. H. Is that all of the goalkeepers you guys have? Surely no one has any others. Who Who is even missing from this list? Leno. If you have Leno, I'd play him this week. Probably above everyone other than Rya. Um, uh, I don't know. I don't know where I'd go. Um, Pope. Oh, Pope. People have Pope. Yeah. Okay. Pope is a maybe somewhat questionable, but I think again you Let's put him between Twix Lammons and Kellaher. I'd be happy with that. Picario. People do not have Picario in their FPL teams. I refuse to believe that. You're having me on. You're absolutely having me on. All right. Well, we'll leave that then for now because I did say I do want to save the bench list. I do want to save the bench list until a little later on in the stream. Um, so give me give us 20 minutes. We'll talk about some other stuff and then we'll be then we'll be back and we'll we'll fill up the other side of the bench list. But for now, I think for goalkeeper wise, I think I'm reasonably happy with that as a as a priority order. That looks good to me. Yeah, happy days. Cool. Right. Um, let's talk a little bit about fixtures, guys. And this is my my fixture calendar. Is that visible? It's fairly visible. Okay. Let's try and get it to fit on screen nicely for you guys. So this is on uh Google Sheets. Those of you guys who are members of the channel at the starting 11 tier or above, you will have access to this uh calendar and I will continue to update it as I see things changing. Um but I want to show you the the I want to give you the lowdown. In fact, I'm going to open it on here because I did tweet it as well. Open image in new tab so I'm not messing around with the cells and stuff. Okay, that's pretty nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. That pretty much fits in perfectly on screen as well. Cool. All right, so we have the double gameweek in 26. We all are we all clear on that by now? Hopefully we are. Blank gameweek 31. So Arsenal are going to blank. Wolves are going to blank. and Crystal Palace and Man City might blank. Probably will blank. 90 95% chance will blank. There is still a chance that we see Man City and Crystal Palace still take part within gameweek 31. It would require Man City to be knocked out of the FA Cup. That's pretty much the only way that's going to happen. Unless also Man City get knocked out of the round of 16 in the Champions League. Again, don't know how likely that is. So, it's pretty unlikely that the fixture will be rescheduled in there because not only did, you know, City have to be knocked out of other competitions and then the Premier League also need to decide we're going to move it there. So, it requires two things to happen. So, I don't think that's going to happen, but it could. We could see that fixture go back in. Then after that, we have double game week 33, which um it's going to be it's going to be interesting. Um, currently the most likely teams to double in 33 are going to be Crystal Palace and Man City because they have multiple ways in which they could double in 33, but um really it's anyone's game really. I mean, even I I've put Burnley and Liverpool as kind of unlikely to double in 33 at present, but that could also change. Um, so they're probably the least Burnley and Liverpool probably the least likely teams to double in 33 right now. Um, still they do have every chance as does everyone else. So, can't really narrow this down too much at the moment, but what we do have here is is an idea of if these teams were to get a double game week, what those double gameweek fixtures would be, I guess. So, for example, if you want to go to Arsenal, if Arsenal were to have a double game week in 33, what would their double game week look like? Well, it would be New It would be Man City away and it would be Newcastle home, which is a pretty rubbish double if we're totally honest. It's not ideal. I guess Arsenal you know they can do anything. Um if Aston Villa were to get a double a little bit nicer Sunderland at home for them away. If Brenford or to get a double it would be Fulham Man United etc etc etc. The nicest looking potential doubles are Forest who have a potential of Burnley and Sunderland which could be really nice. Like I feel like if we're looking for some double gameweek players around there and if Forest were to get a double, I think players like Nico Williams, maybe Mario going to be on the cards. Probably Nico Williams. He's pretty cheap now, right? Um Spurs have a would have a pretty decent double there. Brighton Wolves, West Ham would have Chris Pal and Everton. Um Lees would have a decent double. It's kind of unfortunate that some of the bigger teams wouldn't have the best of doubles. That is the only unfortunate thing. Chelsea, Man United at home, Brighton away. It's okay. Jeremy says, \"I might get Rogers.\" If Villa has that double. Yeah. I mean, if if if Villa get that double, then Rogers is going to be very much on the cards, isn't it? Very much on the cards. Yeah. I I think there are a lot of cheaper players who might have good double game weeks more so than the expensive players, but it's going to be interesting. It's going to be interesting. And then double gameweek 36. The currently the most likely teams to get that double in my opinion are Burnley, Liverpool, Crystal Palace, and Man City. Those teams, I think, are the most likely to get a double game 36 at this point. And that's what they kind of could potentially look like. Now this 36 Brenford at home, Burnley away. That's for Man City by the way. That is genuine triple captain territory. So whilst everyone is talking about Arsenal Gabrielle triple captain 26 against Brenford and Wolves, I like it. I love it. In fact, just be aware that we are potentially looking at Harland against Brenford and Burnley as a double gameweek in gameweek 36. Now the question mark there is, you know, is Harland going to be in form at that time? Is Harlem going to be regularly starting if City are you know prioritizing other competitions? Are you know what's going to what is going to be the situation there? Are City going to be in other competitions or is Harland going to be um you know maybe nailed on for Premier League games? We don't know. It's so far in the future. Is Harland even going to be fit? He could get injured before then and then at that point who you triple captaining mammoosh maybe. Um, so there's a whole bunch of uh question marks around game 36. It's not just whether that double game will happen, but also what is uh what is the the chances that Harland is going to be a good captain, let alone triple captain at that moment. We don't know. We don't know. So, uh yeah, it's kind of a stick or twist situation. That's the information there and I wanted to wanted to share that with those you guys who are interested in that kind of stuff. I know I am. But uh most people just want to know who to bench. I don't care what's happening in gameweek 36. Dan, just tell me who to bench and shut up. Right, Sam L with the super chat here. Thank you so much, Sam. Um and Sam says, \"Don't know whether to do Kalahar to Rya or O'Reilly to Timber. All this doubt regarding Timber has put me off. Currently have Rice and Gabrielle.\" Um, well, I mean, I think you're you're certainly along the right the right lines if you're looking between those two players. Uh, or two transfers maybe. I like O'Reilly to Timber more. I think I think I think if that's my team, I'm doing O'Reilly to Timber because Callah is fine. Um, he's a fine pick and he is for some time now. Um, O'Reilly is a kind of a problem area in your team anyway. So by doing the O'Reilly to timber move, you're addressing a problem you already have in your team rather than just making a a kind of a sideways move in many ways. So yeah, O'Reilly to Timber is what I would do because you deal with an O'Reilly issue. And I know, you know, there's some doubt regarding Timber. There's a there's a little bit of doubt from everything I've been informed about. Timber isn't like injured. He's not injured. Um there may be some load management. Maybe that extends into the gameweek 20 25. But e but even if Timber misses gameweek 25, I would feel confident that he starts both games in gameweek 26 because of that gap between the two fixtures. And again, I tweeted this out as well the other day. Um so you can get a good idea of what the double game week actually looks like in kind of practice. Um, so this weekend we're going to have Arsenal against Sunderland. Then in the midweek we're going to see Arsenal versus Brenford. And then at the weekend, so this is not this weekend, but next weekend we're going to see Arsenal versus Wigan. And then a couple of days after that, in the midweek again, we're going to see Arsenal versus Wolves. So there is a full week between Brenford and Wolves. And I think if Timber is getting rested, rotated, whatever you want to call it, it's going to happen in gameweek 26. Now it could also happen in gameweek 25. I think that's less likely but still possible. But I would be really eyeing up particularly, you know, he's played midweek against Chelsea. He's played loads of games in a row. Gameweek 25 maybe makes some sense to to bench him, rest him, rotate him, Timber, but for game 26, I cannot really see a reason to not play him. And I think he plays 27 as well for the record against Spurs. So 25 is summed out the midweek in the FA Cup. I would be very surprised to see him play. But the double game week, I think Timber looks genuinely good. I think he looks genuinely good. Why do you still have Sakar in? Because I haven't made my transfer yet. They're pretty uh straightforward. I' I've not needed to make a transfer because there haven't been any price changes that have kind of impacted me. Um so I haven't made the move. But I will and I shall. And maybe I should just do that now to uh to avoid any questions because I'm doing it. I'm I'm I'm kind of fully committed at this point because I figured out plans and stuff. So, let's lock this in. There we go, guys. Live transfer live and direct. Rice coming in for Saka at long last. I'm going to confirm that. And this is how I'm looking for gameweek 25, which I think is pretty strong. Actually, I'm reasonably happy with this team. I think the biggest question marks for me are going to be Hill and Chia, but they're playing at home. I think they got good chance of of Defcon, each of them. They're good games to get Defcon in. Um, so we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. But team looks strong. Team looks nice. Migusta. There we have it. Um, would you bench boost now if all four on the bench have an easy fixture or wait until double game week? I would I would wait till double game week to bench boost. I think the big thing about the the bench boost this season and why it's so is you know in my opinion going to be so powerful um is is defcon essentially. So, you're going to have players like Sessi or or indeed Hill or Richards or um Anderson, you know, if any of these kind of cheap defenders who are typically on your bench have double game weeks, even if they don't get any clean sheets and they just get defcon in both games, a bench boost on a cheap defender on a double game week, a cheap defcon defender could be eight points per defender without doing anything. So, say you've got two defenders on your bench. Both of them get defcon in, you know, all of their games. So, two defcons for each. No clean sheets, only one goals conceded each or something like that. That's 16 points on your bench boost from two players already. And that's without a single return. So, um that's what I would say there. Da da da da da da da says, \"Should answer as many questions as possible, mate. I could do I could answer as many questions as possible, but it would mean that there's not very much detail going into the answers of many questions.\" I mean, we could try that if you want. We could try it. Okay. Well, let's do it. I'm going to scroll through and we're going to answer as many questions as possible and we'll we'll see if this makes for good content. I'm willing to try it. Thiago Ekatik Ecat why do you have him buro because I like him Enzo or S start Riches or Keen uh Keen should I keep Semeno and Mark change to Joel Pedro and Paul don't know Riches or Chiao as my third defender don't know maybe Riches someone please help me to play out of these three uh question too long to answer quickly startago creepy startago uh wish I still had XTK um yeah you should he's good so Manuel Rogers probably Rogers Longterm Sessi or Jbury Hall? Uh, probably Senessi. Enzo or Sar. Uh, that was already answered. Minus four for Chow to Timber probably not benchless when in about 20 minutes. Richard or Chow is my third defender. Probably Richards player K or Thiago? Probably a KK. Do minus four to Palmer to Bruno? Uh, yes. Uh, actually no, don't do it. Fernandez and Snessi or Charenzo the the first one. Fernandez and Snessi early to Tim from minus four. So, why do you still have Sakarim? Because I haven't made the transfer yet. Fernandez and Sessio or Enzo and Chalaba? Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of questions that are really, really long that I don't really know how to answer on the Gordon thing. I reckon he's back soon. All the comments are from Newcastle fans are calling him out for the fake news as he can't be able to play anymore when there were three down thoughts. I have no thoughts towards that really. Um, what are your thoughts on Super Mendy? Don't like him as a pick. Hi mate. Start one. Tarovski Hill and Goodmanson start Tarovski probably. Uh, Semeno and Timber or Burma and Ciba? and timber probably Henderson for Chris Palace is worth in goal probably not uh he'll be cleaning Marmush's boots who Harland maybe Enzo Sar for a threew weekek punt how many times that one person asked that same question all right what else we got good pick for Keller whatever either uh star or Dfka probably Davka Wilson So, uh, start main cryp junior junior. [gasps] It doesn't work, does it? It just doesn't work as FPL content. I might I answered a lot of questions. I answered a lot of questions, but but it's not [laughter] but it's not entertaining. It's not useful. It's not uh there's no elaboration behind anything. And the chat clearly hates it. They don't want to listen to it. >> [laughter] >> Sometimes you just got to accept that not all questions will be answered, but those that do will be answered in in a nice amount of detail. You can actually maybe gain something from it or just find it interesting. I don't know. I don't know. Six or seven. Don't know. I don't know how how many people do you think left the stream during that like two minutes? I don't know. Everyone except the person uh whose question is being answered hates it. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Um and there's only one person getting having the questions answered at any given moment. And it's so fast. Can you even recognize when it's your question being answered? I don't know. I don't know. But hey, that was a bit of fun for a couple of minutes, wasn't it? [laughter] Yeah. Bench this. We'll do bench this in like 15 minutes time. and then we'll do loads of bench related questions. Although there seems to be a lot of bench related questions today. A lot of people have benching dilemmas. I feel like I'm the opposite. I I have more players that I want to bench and not enough players that I want to play. Uh keep your chin up, mate. Yeah, don't worry. The chin is chin chin is firmly up. Very firmly up. you answered my question, but I'm not sure. Uh, yeah. I mean, I didn't give any elaboration, so um there's no there's no elaborating, so no, of course. Of course, it's unconvincing. Bambi says, \"My bench is not good this week.\" I feel like I'm probably in a similar boat to you, Bambi. I'm I'm not feeling super confident about my bench this week. Um like Collins away against Newcastle is pretty much all I have. I mean Alderi away against Arsenal is not great. Obi not even going to play. But like when do you ever need to go two players deep on your bench? It's so rare. It's so rare that you, you know, your team is in you, you have like, it's only really like situations like Saka where a player you have, they have no injury issues whatsoever. You're fully aware of the situation and there is no situation and still somehow they pick up an injury in uh in the warm-up and suddenly, you know, you got an auto sub. If you're gonna get an auto sub, usually you have a you probably have an idea that it might happen. Like you see a you know you think you you know one of your players is a little rotation risk or even even rotation risk players they still usually come off the bench and get one pointers anyway. So unless the player is injured and you usually know about that ahead of time like it's very rare you get auto subs. I mean I certainly very rarely get auto subs and when I do I do not score points from them. Let me tell you that. Uh Simone says, \"Is Foden a bad option or maybe a good differential?\" I would say I would lean towards bad option, I think. Yeah, I think I'd be done with Foden at this point. It's a bad fixture. We got lots of fixtures. Uh we got some fixture congestion in the Premier League, so there's going to be rotation risk there as well. You know, there already has been with Foden, I think. Um I think I would be looking to sell if possible. Do you think Rhys James will start? I do not. I do not think Reese James will start. Apparently, he has a bit of an issue at the moment. So, I would not be feeling too confident about him. Polio says, \"I think I have made the mistake of wild carding. Could you please give us your personal plans on the chips and when to play them?\" Yeah, I mean I can certainly tell you when I'm going to be playing my chips because I think I'm the only one I'm I'm unsure about is um is it here? This one I'm looking for. The only one I'm unsure about is the triple captain, but I'm leaning towards playing that in game 26. And I'm going to I'm going to I'll talk about that in the team selection video, but I'm also going to make a Tik Tok uh slash Instagram reel about uh the triple captain situation. But I'm leaning towards playing it in gameweek 26 on Gabrielle only because I think there's too much uncertainty around a gameweek 36 triple captain because in my mind gameweek 26 is a triple captain week. The other possible triple captain weeks are gameweek 36 if that ends up being a double. I think there's a chance that 35 or 37 could also be double game weeks as well. Um so we'll see. you know, it's less likely, but you know, it's certainly possible. 35, 37 could be doubles. 36 could be is is more likely to be a double, but 26 is definitely a double. So, 26 looks like a good opportunity. As for the other chips, so I'm looking to wild card in gameweek 32. I'm looking to bench boost in 33. So, basically, I'll bench boost in 30 in gameweek 32 to set up a really nice, really strong bench boost team for gameweek 33. And then a lot of the teams who have a double gameweek in 33 will not play full stop in gameweek 34. So a lot of the doublers, most of the doublers in 33 will be the same teams the blank in 34. So you're going to want to make a quick transition between 33 and 34. And if you're looking to bench boost in gameweek 33, that means your full squad or most of your squad is going to be double gameweek players, which means that most of your squad is not going to have a fixture in gameweek 34. So quick transition needed. Um that could be a wild card, it could be a free hit depending on how you set this up. But yeah, for me it makes the most sense to free bench boost 33, free hit and 34. So in conclusion, triple captain most likely 26, possibly 36. Wild card 32, bench boost 33, free hit 34. That's my plan. And I think it is the most excluding the triple captain, which I don't think is obvious. I think there are definitely different ways to play that one. I think the remainder of the chips, the wild card 32, the benchm 33, and the free hit 34, that makes to me by far the most sense as a strategy to the extent where I'm not considering any other strategy. And that's unusual. Usually, you know, I've got a couple of different strategies in mind that could potentially work. This season is is a little different and the way I kind of see things kind of playing out. Um, I think this has got to be the way. I think this has got to be the way. So, yeah, that's that's uh that's what I'll be doing. That's what I'll be doing pretty much. I mean, if you've already used the wild card, I still think that's okay. I I think you can still do the same strategy if you've already used your wild card. You're just going to have to be a little bit more cautious around saving transfers, I guess, ready to maximize gaming 33. So only if you've already wild carded, you basically need to only make transfers when strictly necessary because what you want to do is you want to have five free transfers in gameweek 32. Use one of them to bring in a a double game player and then in game 33 you'll have five again and then you're going to use all five and then you can free hit in game 34. So I still if you've already wild carded this strategy is still possible. is slightly more difficult and you do have to be a little bit more cautious around the moves that you're making particularly in the short to medium term between now and game week 31. You basically can't change your team very much at all and then the strategy is still possible. But if you've already used your free hit, that's when you're probably going to be in trouble. If you've already used your wild card and your free hit before gameweek, if you if you use both your wild card and your free hit before gameweek 32, pretty much screwed in terms of chip strategy. If you use both by the time gaming 32 has has pass as well before the deadline hits, I guess, but hopefully most people can save at least one of those two chips for that by then. And then yeah, gameweek 34 is the is the tricky one. That's going to be the that's going to be the the blank game that screws a lot of people. And I think there's going to there's actually I think there's a lot of um there's going to be a lot of FPL points to be gained. There's going to be a lot of rank to be gained because what a lot of people will do is they'll see, oh man, I have my Arsenal players and my Man City players. They're blanking in in gaming 31 and I'm tripled up on Arsenal. I'm tripled up on Man City. I've got some Crystal Palace players in. I', you know, maybe got some Wolves players in as well. They'll look at game week 31 and they'll think I'm going to free hit this week or I'm going to wild card this week because that's how I'm going to solve the situation. And then they'll get to game week 34 and instead of four teams blanking, it's eight teams blanking and then they'll just be completely screwed. So I think huge huge rank gains to be made in the period between gameweek 30 really 32 to 34. I think most engaged managers will be able to half their rank at least. Depends what your rank is I guess. But like, you know, if you even if you feel like I'm really struggling this season, I'm struggling to break into the top one million places. If you're ranked one million in gameweek 32 and you followed this chip strategy, I don't see why you wouldn't be ranked 500k by the end of gameweek 34. If you're ranked 100k, I don't see why you can't get to 50k over that three gameweek period. If you're at 200k, I don't see why you wouldn't be 100k after a three gaming period. And that late on in the season is is is a difficult time to gain major rank because the points gaps between ranks are a little larger. But I think there is um I think there's going to be some big opportunities to to gain because because it seems so clear to me that there is one clearly best chip strategy and I very much doubt that enough people will be engaged or you know really nerdy enough to be thinking about the these kind of things in that amount of detail. But there you go. Um, right. We got a super chat from Google Abroad who says, \"Bench one, Chia, Foden, Watkins, or Anderson.\" Uh, definitely wouldn't bench Anderson. Um, I think I would bench Foden. I think I would bench Foden. That's what I would do. Um, or ideally sell him. Ideally sell him. Jeremy says, \"I missed the variety of chip strategies. That was damn fine.\" And I agree with you. I mean, I wish I could I could I could see another chip strategy that I think would work. I mean, I've some I've seen some people say, \"Oh, what about, you know, free hit and gaming 33? Could that work?\" We never never know for sure what what will and won't work. Um, but I see a lot of problems and holes in a Gameweek 33 free hit strategy that just aren't there in a gameweek 34 free hit strategy. That's what I'll say there. Padra says, \"Hi, Dan. Start Morgan Rogers or Daniel Moz.\" You know what's crazy about that question and why it's when I was looking through the chat, it stuck up to me immediately because my name is Daniel. My wife's name is Morgan. So, you're saying start Daniel or Morgan? Me or my wife? Who should we start? And as such, I'm going to do the kind thing and say start Morgan and bench Daniel. That makes sense right now. There we go. Conspiracy right now. Dan, you never come across my algorithm anymore. Really? You need to like videos. [laughter] And that genuinely I know it's like it's obviously it's self- serving. I want people to like my videos, like my streams and stuff. Um but I think it genuinely it does help your um your your algorithm to recommend you the same content if you are liking it. So if you click like on a on a piece of content or you know what just watch the content all the way through then it will be recommended to you again on the algorithm the next video. Whereas if you kind of if you ignore a video on your on your algorithm or you don't like it it's less likely to appear. So, I don't know, maybe that will help. But yeah, no, um I think the uh the algorithm is is pretty crazy right now. I I think YouTube is is genuinely doing a really good job of promoting a much wider range of content from smaller creators, from larger creators, um and really trying to help the little guy in many respects. So, um yeah, it's um it's nice in that respect, but uh the algorithm is a little tricky. Plus, there's just so much FPL content now. It's not like a few years ago. There's so many FPL channels. It's uh it's hard to it's hard to stand out anymore. Um hopefully we're still doing a pretty good job over here. There's certainly enough of you guys sticking around that um that I'm still happy at least. Right. Um anyway, anyway, uh Thson Aronson is a differential. I I just think there's too many good midfielders right now to go there. Um so that's my opinion. Uh Michael says, \"Hi Dan, apologies. I've already answered but thoughts on Sack Mawke for two weeks.\" We haven't actually spoken about Madek today to be fair. So I'm happy to do a little little moment on him. Um so no, [laughter] no is the short answer. Um, one of the reasons is with Saka out, you know, I don't think we expect Mawke to play every single game. I think he will be managed a little bit. He's already played against Chelsea, already played against um, who did Arsenal play last week. Um, I've forgotten already leadeds. Leads. Um, he's already played against Leads. He's already played against Chelsea. Is he going to play Sunland, Brenford, Wigan, Wolves? maybe even Spurs. I don't know if he starts every game um in that period because that's a lot of games. So, you know, there's maybe one rest in there, maybe two. Then you've kind of got Trosard, FPL Vince, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel. Then you got Trosard and Martinelli who are capable of taking some minutes um on the wing. Maybe even maybe even Gabrielle Jesus could take some minutes off the wing as well. You never know. Havs maybe is a bit rogue. uh essay maybe a bit rogue but you know there are other options is what I'm saying and even if Madawek is the start is he starting 90 minutes probably not then we have Saka okay when is Saka going to be back well gameweek 27 looks like most likely right now what if he's actually available the second game in gameweek 26 so you get mad for 25 you get Mawke for the first game in 26 but actually he doesn't even play in the game at 26 not because he's rested with other players but because Saka's back already possibly and then we come to game 27 where we are expecting Sacka to be back by that point and you've guaranteed that you're going to have to spend another transfer on Madek. So really kind of spending two transfers to buy Mowk because you know for a fact that you'll have to transfer him back out again and and soon as well. It's not like a R. Like Rice, don't get me wrong, you're probably going to transfer him back out by 31 because he'll blank in 31. But you can keep Rice if you have other issues to deal with immediately, you can still keep Rice for every game week up until then if you need to. Whereas Madawke, you know, becomes a problem that needs addressing immediately. And if you already have if you also have like another injury in your team or something like that, then suddenly game of 27, you've got two issues that you need to deal with. uh and maybe only one transfer to uh in which to to resolve it. So yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know. I'm not massively feeling Mad. And there's a few reasons as to why. Hopefully that makes sense. Rice feels boring. I agree, Michael. Rice is boring. But um yeah, sometimes boring is right. And and I I will you know, if you watched me for a while, you'll always know I will always try and find the interesting angle if there is one. Unfortunately, this time I'm not sure there is, but yeah, I guess we'll see. Uh Tom Junior says, \"Saw you on the news, bro.\" Uh, this is news to me. Um, I don't know. Could you please elaborate? Or maybe you're typing on the wrong in the wrong live chat. I don't know. That's probably the most likely thing that's happened here because I don't think I've been in the in the news. Uh, Polio Scosby says, \"Mate, keep up the great work. Cheers from Boston. Boston. Well, cheers right back to you to to Boston. Cody Bllayy, thank you very much for becoming a member of the channel. Right. Um I think I think we're ready for a bench list, aren't we? Couple of chats first. We've got super chat here from Jonathan. He says, \"Minus four for Joel Pedro.\" No, I don't even need to read the rest of this message to know the answer is no, but I will anyway. Um, minus four for J Pedro to cover for Semeno forwards or Munoz for O'Reilly so I don't have to play Muki or if O'Reilly is benched. Want both in the future. So no, I I don't I I no pretty much I wouldn't take a minus four for any of those. I would rather play O'Reilly or Mukle even O'Reilly one pointer off the bench and take a minus four. So no is the answer. I don't think I would take a minus four. I mean you got to think about it. Is it worth four points? Would you rather have just an assuming it's like a four-point auto sub? If things go wrong, then you're you're kind of up four points because you didn't take the minus four kind of thing. So really, you would need your replacement to outscore by five points. I guess if you assume a one-pointer from someone like O'Reilly or Muki, you need you need your replacement to score at least five points for it to reward you immediately. I don't know, man. I don't know, man. I think I think I think I'm I'm not I'm not feeling the Joel Pedro thing maybe as much as other people are. I don't think Semen needs covering. I don't think I think O'Reilly and Melli still have some use in the future. Yeah, I just I can't see it. Can't see the vision. I really can't. Um, but anyway, um, let's go ahead and do the bench list. I think you guys have been patient enough. Uh, right. So, let's um let's uh add some players here. So, where do you want to start? Um, I've got who I've got I've got a couple of players in there already. Um, and I'm pretty much happy with that as well. Let me know um, which players you'd like to see in the bench list. I'm going to throw Thiago in here. Um, Elliot Elliot Anderson in here as well. Elliot Anderson in there. Alder was going to go right to the bottom with Muki. Put M slightly above. Esteev would be for me pretty low still. Uh got super chat here from Jacob who says, \"Chow, creepy mane tarovski. Rank them one to four pull this game week, please. Also, I like the mustache, my man. Handlebar mustache in the future. Let's go, champ.\" I don't think I'm capable of of growing a handlebar mustache. It kind of only goes this far, unfortunately. Um, but there you go. Thank you at least. Um, but anyway, my friend, let's have a look at these players. So, Chiao, Creepy, Mani, Tarovski. Um, I mean, I can go ahead and probably put all of them on the bench list. So, let's do that. I think that's probably the best way to do this because I can see a few other people are asking for about similar players. So, I think we put Tarovski here. Um, we put ciao. Tough one here. Um, or would I just try Watkins ahead of these guys? I think I maybe would try Watkins ahead of these guys. Um, so maybe I try Watkins here. Okay. Uh, Bruno G. Can he go any higher? Probably not. So, we've got Chiao, we've got Tarakovski, we need Crooppy Junior and Mane. Creepy Junior is probably not going to be a player to play, is he? Because you got that rotation risk still. you've got that, you know, well, maybe not rotation risk, but you're going to get early sub. He gets early subbed every game. So, if he doesn't score from his one shot, you know, actually, it's not even if he doesn't score from his one shot. You need to hope that he takes one shot in 60 minutes so he can get the goal because he will score it. He's so clinical. His ball striking is just phenomenal. Um, but no, he's kind of a a pretty high high likelihood blank, isn't he? Kind of player. And as such, do you take a risk on him? Probably not, but maybe ahead of some of like the weaker defenders. So, Creepy Jr. will put him there. Mane Chelsea at home, it's not such a bad fixture, but you know, when you play for Wolves, it's pretty unlikely you're going to get attacking returns, right? So, um let's see. Man, they can go probably below creepy junior maybe. At least you're gonna get defcon for Richard and Stev. I don't know. I'm going to put Manet here. He has set pieces as well. Man, which is pretty nice. I'm going to put him there. Um, right. So, we've got a super chat here uh that says, \"Should I keep Kukura?\" Uh, yeah, I think for for the next couple of weeks, Kuko is fine to keep because the fixtures are good and I think he will start. There's no injury issue there, is there? So, um, yeah. Nice. Um, and then we can just start filling up with some of the other players you guys are suggesting. Uh, can I do Chaloba? No, Chaloba is a is a a play. Um, there's no questions around that one really. Um, Timber, no. I mean, really, are people really that worried about Timber this week? You play him. Maybe not ahead of Ekit to be fair. I do really like Ekit, but you play Timber. Gayhei. All right, now we're talking business. So Gayhei would go pretty low for me. Probably maybe even lower. Maybe bottom. Is that harsh? didn't catch wide cho ahead of Richards. I think it's just better chance of a clean sheet is um probably the the obvious answer. Um I think Brenford at home is probably a better fixture than Brighton away and I think Newcastle are probably a better defense than Crystal Palacear right now probably. So yeah, that's the reason there. Uh, sell Bruno G to Anderson and Bench Richards. Yeah, you know what? Yes, I quite like that. I quite like that. If it's for free. Yeah. Um, Lewis Hall can pretty much go right next to Ciao. Should there be that much of a gap between them? That's the only question. Am I that confident? Maybe I'm not. Maybe we'll throw so light ahead and with the deathcon gone. Are we being a bit harsh on riches? Can we throw him up one more? Let's bring them a little closer together. Right. Sessi. So sessi I like. Um Sessi I'd be definitely willing to put a little higher. It's not perfect. It's not ideal, but the defcon gs that he gets is um always very useful. Yeah, I'm going to put Hill alongside Cessi. They're much of a muchness these days. Evan Nilson against Aston Villa at home. H maybe here like that. N says, \"Hi Dan. Hope you're well. Triple United versus Spurs.\" Done. Nice. Nice. That's triple United attack, right Niky? Exciting stuff. Hope for a big scoring game then. Z the GA with a super chat here says Bruno G Chucky and a weak bench. Two playing defenders. Zero free transfers 2.6 on the bench. Is it worth to go on minus four for who? No, it's it's probably not worth going for a minus four. I think I mean I think Turkey will play. I think Bruno G has a good chance to play. The only way I would take a You got You got 2.6 in the back. The only way I would take a minus four is if you didn't have Bru uh Bruno Fernandez. But again, can you could could you do could you want Bruno G or Turkey to Bruno Fernandez? That would probably be worth a minus four because you could captain him. And outside of that, is there an argument to say Rice? If you don't have Rice and you need to get that Arsenal triple up anyway, maybe that's worth a minus four. And then and then so so yeah I I take a minus4 for Bruno Fernandez. I'd take a minus four for Rice. I would maybe take a minus four for Burmo. Less likely but still maybe Vertz but no one else. I wouldn't take a minus four for Enzo or Anderson or or anyone anyone else. Palmer. No. Yeah. So it's literally just those four players. Bruno, yes. Rice, yes. And Burmo, yeah, maybe that we we are very very much on the edge of whether it's worth it or not at that point. So there we go. Those are some players I would take a minus four for. No one else really. No one else really. Um if Harland doesn't start, what's the panic buy? There's no there's no panic buyers. Don't do not panic buy. Keep Har. If Harland doesn't start, then Harland is more likely to start the following game, not less likely. If Harland doesn't start, he's rested in his most difficult game against Liverpool and then has good fixtures after that. Great. That's good news for Harland, not bad news. It's bad news for Harland in game at 25, but it's good news for Harland in 26 because it means he's well rested for a better fixture. Um, so there is no panic buy if Harland doesn't start. But I think Harland's going to start anyway. So, um I don't think we'd even have to cross that bridge. Uh Jury Hassan says, \"Start Rogers, bench Crooppy and Sessi for Road on Start.\" I don't think I bench Rogers. So, yeah, start Rogers. Certainly ahead of Krooppy and indeed ahead of Sessi. Rodon is interesting. And a few people do have Rodon, don't they? And they're thinking Forest at home. It's not a bad fixture. Leads are okay. I'd maybe be a thing is Rodon doesn't really get Defcon and I think that's the one thing that's putting me off him. I'm going to put Rodon not super high. I'm going to I'm maybe going to put him here. And then that should be all of the players you mentioned. Hill is on there already. Virgil is a good one. Yeah, we haven't spoken about Virgil, have we? Someone asked Richards or Hill. Both of Richards and Hill are on the bench list, my friend. Um, Virgil. Okay, so Virgil is not going to go particularly high this week. Um, do I fancy him ahead of Richards? Um, tough. I kind of I kind of do. I kind of do, I think. Yeah. Okay, we'll go there. Big10 pound super chat here from Benjamin. Hopefully we can help you out here, Ben. Uh, hi Dan. Can you help me with your uh with my team, please? My team is Donnaruma, Chalaba, Ciba, Gabrielle, Fernandez, Rogers, Wilson, Seno, Jar, Pedro, and Harland. Is there any changes you would make? Um, I mean, if you have Drafka on your bench, I would maybe play Drafa ahead of Donnaruma, even if you have Darlow on your bench. I play Darlow ahead of Donnaruma as well. Uh, Chaloba, Civa, Gabrielle, great. You only have, hey, you only have two Arsenal players. Chala, Gabriel, Fernandez, Ro Wilson, midfielders looks in fairly good shape. Front line looks in fairly good shape. Is there an argument to sell Donnaruma to Rya and go triple Arsenal defense either that or sell your fifth midfielder to Rice? I don't know if that's affordable or not. Maybe Donnaruma because you need Triple Arsenal for next game week with the double. And if you have free transfers, you may as well go one week earlier and and grab that Sunderland fixture as well because that Sunderland fixture is good. Really good. So there you go, Benjamin. Hopefully those are a few possible solutions. Your priority now is to ensure that you have three Arsenal players for gameweek 26. If it's possible to to improve your team by doing it one week early, then I would do that. Um, so yeah, Rice in for your fifth midfielder. I wouldn't sell Bruno Rogers Wilson or Semeno for Rice this week. I wouldn't do any of those. But if you have a fifth midfielder that you would be willing to sell to get Rice, then I would do that. And I would be willing to do Donnaruma to to Rya as well. Even though it seems sideways, it isn't really. It's um it gets you the third Arsenal player and you can just hide him on your bench in game 31 when Arsenal have the blank and play the Brava. There we go. Right. Hopefully that was helpful. Hopefully that was helpful. Cool. All right. There you have it. There you have it. Chewy FPL says, \"I don't know how people have the mental capacity to watch a game owning triple defense. I did last season and it might have been the more most stressful game I've watched not involving my club.\" Yeah, I mean, even double defense is just it's just painful. It's just painful, man. It's painful. The FPL boys saying in Burma and Gabrielle were the best captains for this week. Your take down. I prefer Bruno Fernandez. I prefer Bruno Fernandez, but I I I don't think you were in the stream yet, comedy addict, but at this at the kind of front end of the stream. We spoke a little bit about captains. And I I included both and Gabrielle as in as part of that second tier of captains for this week alongside um who else did I say? I said ETK and uh maybe one other might not have been it might have just been Gabrielle and ETK. Maybe I mentioned one other but it certainly wasn't any Chelsea players. Um oh Harland Harland who's always technically a captain option but yeah Bruno's Bruno's the best. But yeah I like them. I like them. I like them too. Who have you bought instead of Enzo, Chewy? You've bought and Jai for the second time. You bought You brought second and Jai into your team somehow. Uh, [snorts] sell or keep Chiao if I keep him bench him or Garner. Oh, we could throw Ghana in in the uh bench list for sure. I would play Garner ahead of Chiao. Um, if if possible of Tarovski as well to be fair. Maybe even ahead ahead of Thiago. That would be close. I'm going to go I'm going to go I'm going to go here. Where's Wilson on the list? Wilson, go higher. You bought Estabal. [laughter] That's brave. That is brave. That is very brave. So, I'm going to put Wilson here. You know what I'm also going to do? I'm going to move I'm going to move Anderson up. Yeah, I'm going to put the Anderson next to his brother. Anderson. The Anderson brother. The Anderson twins next to each other. Kurt says, \"Hi, Dan. I'm new to the channel. I have to start one of Creeper Junior or Riches. Please help.\" Well, welcome first of all, Kurt Curt. And uh let me tell you that what you see on screen is for you purposely. And for anyone else who is also new to the channel, um if you haven't seen the bench list before, we probably should have done an explainer earlier, but um we've got a list here of players who a lot of people are considering benching. And we we've got them in an order, a a um a start order. Um the players towards the top I would be more willing to start. The players towards the bottom I would be looking to bench. If you have two players so in you know what were your examples Krooer Junior and Richer. So you got Croo Jun and Riches. You need to figure out what my personal recommendation or my preference to start. You look for the two players on the list. You can see okay Cooper Junior is down here and Riches is oh a little bit lower here. So given that Cooper Junior is higher on the list, then that means that I personally prefer to play Cooper Junior to riches and that is how um we answer that you may have seen similar bench lists on other YouTube channels. Let me assure you this is the original. This is the original bench list. Uh the first of its kind and it's been running for years and years and years. Um, but yes, there are other bench lists, but this is the OG. This is the OG. Um, right. What do we got here? Uh, Bazall FPL says, \"Hi, mate. Started my own FPL channel last week. Would love any feedback you have.\" Yeah, man. Um, feel free to send me a DM probably on Twitter or X, uh, with your channel link and I'll, um, I'll be happy to check it out for you, my friend. and welcome to the content creation community, my friend. Um, hopefully you're enjoying your your the creat the creativity the creation process so far. It's great fun, man. It's real real good hobby. Um, Ray Perry here says, \"Chelsea and Arsenal triple up with Mane on the bench. Ready for a double game with a bench boost for that. Forced to wild card this week due to poor form. I'm not super keen on a on a bench boost um next week and I'm not super keen on a Chelsea triple up either. I think triple up on Arsenal, yes, definitely. Chelsea double up I think is fine. Pick one defender, one attacker that you like. Um because after a couple of game weeks, Chelsea actually have some of the worst fixtures in the entire Premier League. So, it's going to be a lot of, you know, a lot of forced transfers. And if you've wild carded early, you're going to have blank gameweek 31 to contend with. You're going to have another blank gamewe in 34. You're going to have double gamweek 33. And these are going to, if you wild carded ear early, these are going to, you know, be real focuses of your transfers. You're going to need a lot of transfers for those. So, you can't really afford to be bringing in players now who you know you're going to have to transfer in soon. Every player that you bring in kind of has to work for five, six game weeks. and triple Chelsea just do not work for for more than three game weeks in in in three four game weeks time, three games time, whatever. Arguably, every Chelsea player is a cell. Every Chelsea player is it needs to be removed. So that's three transfers you're kind of banking in if you like. So yeah, I wouldn't do that. Um Man\u00e9 maybe, maybe. Um I'm kind of a little on the fence with Mane. kind of useful for the bench boost, but I'm not also not really expecting any any FPL returns from him on a bench boost. Uh, sorry, on the on the on the on the double game week. Yeah, don't think I bench boost. I think there's going to be better opportunities. Got another super chat here from Benjamin again. Another \u00a35. Benjamin, you need to stop spending all this money, my friend. I as much as I appreciate it. Um, two5 super chats is too much, man. It's too much. But anyway, just signed Ray. Forgot to mention, Dan, that my bench is Ruffs Lefay Muk Est. Okay. So, yeah, none of them really playable. Uh, est first on the bench and yeah, I wouldn't take a minus four for your bench. I'll just have a STE as your first bench option and see what happens next. I shall indeed uh say that. So, yeah, it looks like you're sorted, Ben. Looks like you're sorted, my friend. No need to go any further than that. A few people asking about a Jewsbury Hall. So I think we can throw him on the bench list. Got Jai here. Carl wants a Jai. Okay. Um so Jewsbury Hall I wouldn't put super high. I don't think you kind of be in the so territory perhaps. Something like here. Um maybe even that's a little generous. I don't know. Um and then would go a little higher. Maybe in Evan Nilson territory. Maybe a little higher. Let's throw him one above Evan Nelson. There we go. If I can spell his name. Cool. Cool. On the bench. No. Playing Burnley, man. You're not going to You're not going to bench Bowen. You're not going to bench Bowen. Calbertt Leuen. Calbertt Lewon is genuinely an interesting one. I would start Calbertt Lewin for what it's worth. Um probably ahead of a lot of these players really. Um here maybe pretty high. Why Anderson over Wilson? Anderson is the one player I don't have who I'm worried about not having this week. I think it's a good opportunity for defensive contributions. I think it's a good opportunity for clean sheets against this Everton side. I think he's got a 11 pointer loading really. I I do I mean obviously it's not guaranteed or anything like that, but I think there's a very real possibility of an 11 pointer from Anderson this week and that scares me a lot. Um, and you know, Calbertt Lewen, he's above Cal Lewen, for example. Cal Leuen would require two goals or a goal and an assist to to match that score line. And I don't think that's super likely. So, yeah, Anderson scares me this week. Like, a bad week is four points for Anderson. So, we're looking at a range really of four to 11 points for Anderson this week. It's not bad, is it? It's not bad at all. So, um, yeah, particularly for a defender be right up there. Uh, Cody says, \"Would you take a hit for Ma to Vertz or Burmo and play him instead of Gay?\" Uh, yeah, I think I would if you have no bench. Uh, yeah, I would. I would go formo before I went for Verts, I think. Um, and then we I think I think we will be revisiting Verts very soon, though. He looks good. Um, but I think Burma is probably a slightly higher priority because his good fixtures are kind of right now, aren't they? Yeah. Play Virgil or sell Muel for Chaloba? I'd play Virgil. Where would you put Band of Ven in the benching order? Oh, uh, not very high. Maybe higher than maybe higher than, uh, Gay, but that's about it. very low. What would your criteria be for selling Harland? Uh, okay. My criteria would be uh anterior crucet ligament injury. Yeah, if you got one of them, I would sell him in fairness. Like I have to admit it. I know, I know, I know it's a bit controversial. Uh but yeah, that would be my criteria to sell. Harland Oliver said, \"Dan, last week you called me your horse.\" That's a hint. What? What does that sentence mean? If I if to guess your rank every if you guess my rank in a spread of 100, I'll let you choose my captain. Let's see if you remember me. A spread of 100. Wait. Okay. If Okay, there's a sensible Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, Oliver. I remember now. I remember now. Yes. Everything's coming back. In that case, the the guess is easy. If it's a spread of 100, then my answer is 100. And then I get to pick your captain, Oliver. Oliver, let us know what is your rank. So, if it's between one and 200 in the world, I get to pick your captain. You're number four in the world. No way, dude. That's amazing. No way. Is that up from last week? I mean, even if he stayed the same, that's still incredible. I'm having a look right now. Uh, and we'll have a look at your your team as well, and we'll see what looks like your captain. Have you already made moves, Oliver? I'm sure we're all dying to know. So, number four FB manager in the world is in the chat right now. All right, so 64 points. Okay, so you're not moved. You're not moved. That's fine. That's fine. So, one person went up. You caught up on a little bit on that guy. I think you've overtaken this guy, but yeah, they've moved around you. Lisa Snells Chow for Timber or Chalaba. have no one from Chelsea. Get get a Timber if you haven't got your triple Arsenal. That's the priority. Way above Chelsea in my opinion. Anyway, how bad is my memory? Uh maybe not great. I mean it did come back to me. Uh go to my team. I did Watkins to who eligible? Oh, Evan Nilson. Huh? Can you captain Deon Nilson? Okay, in my defense, did I say to go to Evan Nelson? Maybe. But no, I don't think I would have because I remember saying last week in in the stream that I'm not massively keen on Evan Nilson. I remember saying I wasn't massively killing Ev Nelson and I definitely would not have said to captain him. Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to take responsibility for that one, Oliver. I mean, I can't remember exactly what I said. Maybe I'm lying. Maybe I've forgotten. But certainly from memory, I remember talking in that chat saying exactly the same as I've said about Joel Pedro today is that Wolves away is not actually that good of a fixture. But I probably also said that there aren't many other options in the forward position. Um, but I certainly wouldn't have recommended captaining it. Right. Right. It's fine. We're going to get back on the horse here. We need to get Bruno Fernandez. Oh, you advised me not to transfer in Evan Nelson last week, Jerry. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm sure I probably said the same thing to um to Oliver. All right. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. This can be You told me You told me not to do Watkins to Evan Nilson and I did it anyway and I captained him and it did me dirty. Oh, okay. Right. So, so I told you not to do something. You did it anyway. Oliver, stick me stick with me this time because we need to get you to win FPL. We need to get to win. Let me just go through these super chats first of all. Uh we got one here from Tammy Hats that says, \"I have Virgil Chala, Gabrielle, Mukiel, and Alder. Should I sell any to bring in Hill or should I roll my one free transfer?\" Um, I would just play Virgil Chaliba Gabrielle this week and roll. Um, yeah, bench Muki and Alder if possible. If you have to play Muki, fine. But anyway, let's have a look at Oliver's team. So, he sold Bruno G, brought in Rice, which I think is the right move. It would have been nice to get Bruno G in here. Um, all right. I'm choosing your captain then. How brave you feeling, Oliver? I mean, you're feeling brave enough that you captained Elvinson last week. I would be looking primarily in your team at Gabrielle and Bowen as captains. Um, so I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm going to say Bowen. You feeling brave? Let's go Bowen then. Bowen against Burnley. I mean, it's not a bad um one to take on. a penalty taking Bowen in in form against Burnley, you know, are capable of getting defensive contribution points. Um, I think your captain is going to be Bowen because you don't have Bruno. If you have Bruno, I would just say Bruno, but it is a shame you don't have Bruno. I can't really figure out a way of you doing it. You're doing bow and captain brother. Let's get it. All right, man. All right, man. I will be I will be rooting for you. I will be thinking about uh you with your bow and captain. And make sure to join join the FPL Mate Classic League as well. Come on, man. I can see you're not in the FPL Mate Classic League. You're in vocals. You're in Raptors. Leave them. Leave them. Join mine. Um yeah. All right. Let's Let's get it. Let's see what you can do. Cool. All right. Good luck, Oliver. Let's get back to everyone else. Let's get back to everyone else. We got about 28 minutes till 27 uh minutes until deadline. Um I'll dip again. Haha. Then thanks. I'll join it right away. Nice one. Uh yeah, we've got 27 minutes until deadline. So, make sure you guys are almost there with your thoughts. Kappa Junior says, \"Bench Snessi or Creeper Jr.?\" I would bench Creeper Junior over Snessi. I believe that's what the bench doth say. And thank you very much for the super sticker, Noah. Uh not sure if you meant to attach a message there. I don't I think there's a limit on uh you know, you have to put in a certain amount of currency before it allow you to type in a message, but we'll keep an eye out for you in the chat. Noah. Um, Yash says, \"You said you were going to captain Gabrielle in one of your videos. What happened?\" Oh, I did. I did captain Gabrielle. When was that? It was like two game weeks ago. It went terribly. Uh, yeah, I captained Gabrielle in gameweek 23 for a one-pointer against who was it against? It was against Man United just as they decided to they were going to be a good football team. Um, and then I've got him I've got Gabriel as the vice captain right now. I said I captain Gabri for this week. I never said that. I never said I'll be captain Gabrielle this week. I said he I maybe might have said that he was an option. I might said I'm going to put him as a vice captain, but yeah. No, I've not really looked at Gabrielle captain at all this game week, but maybe next week. Actually, what who am I kidding? Definitely next week. Noah here says Turkey to rise from minus four was in Swiss Franks. Oh, Swiss Franks. I didn't even know. I mean, that makes sense. I was going to say, do they not use euros in Switzerland? But, you know, in in the uh in the quest for neutrality, I guess uh the common currency would not work. Um there we go. Yash, you must have watched an older video in my life. I was never captaining Gabriel this week. Um turkey to rice for a minus four. If you have nothing on your bench, then I guess yes. Um, yeah, it depends. It depends. If you can just kind of play someone else for this game week, then then fine. But, um, but generally that improves your team and it sets you up for the double game week. So, I'm not against that as a minus four. I'm not against it. One of the few players I would take a minus 44 for. So yeah, maybe maybe. Uh Lavari says, \"Hi Dan, greetings from Finland. Just wondering why all content creators prefer Thiago over Ciao even though Newcastle has been great at home this season.\" I mean they have been at home, but they've also been errorprone and we've kind of seen that a lot. Um we've seen that a lot this this uh this season. So the fact that you know like for example Ecat against Newcastle last week we saw Ekit get given a little bit of space as the striker and able to thrive in that that uh kind of situation. Thiago might have a similar situation. Thiago penalty taker. It's always difficult to bench a penalty taker. So yeah I would if I had Thiago I would play him ahead of Chiao. Yeah. Um but you know don't you know of course Newcastle they are better at home. That is a fact and if they were playing a better fixture maybe we'd be more bullish on on Chiao but yeah kind of fallen out of favor. Um Ruben says is Pedro worth it over Echitique? In my opinion no. Uh I prefer Echitique to Pedro even this gameweek. Uh someone says why no Chelsea players in this list. It's a bench list man. I mean is anyone thinking about benching Chelsea players? I don't think they are. I don't think they are. So, I don't think they really um need to go on here. True Killer says, \"Best captain of Enzo Bowen or Gabrielle.\" Um I would say probably Bowen, maybe Gabrielle, but probably Bowen. Where would you put Chalaba? You play Chaliba. You play Ch. There's There's There's no I can't think of a single situation in which I wouldn't play Chalaba. I would say Chalaba is arguably the third best defender this week in the entire game after Gabriel and Timber for this week specifically. I mean Rob says, \"Sorry I missed the member stream, but thanks for the advice. Bench Evan Nilson for Anderson.\" Nice. Nice. Yeah, I'm keen on Anderson this week. Bench one of Ech Wilson, Semeno or Rice. That's tough. Is the answer Semeno? Might be. Might be. Uh last minute uh pick hill or road on for the next three weeks. Hill. Hill. I'm team hill and I'll die on that hill. Who's your captain? My hill. My captain is my hill. My c my captain is going to be Bruno Fernandez. Pretty boring for me this week. I know. We all saying that I think in the overall player base, we'll still see we'll see a lot of Harland. We'll see a lot of Joel Pedro. Will Keen star I think he has a good chance. Collins on the bench list. Sure. to my fellow Collins owners. I would not be super confident. I wouldn't be a confident Colin. Um, but he's he's a defcon guy. I guess we put him above us on that basis. Something like that. Shane says, \"King for Anderson or play Krooppy. Best mid under 7 million.\" Best mid under 7 million is probably is Milasar now that we've seen him on penalties. Um it's myar 6.3 million I believe. Um yeah, if I had to bring in an under seven million midfielder right now, I would go S and I would go for S ahead of Enzo right now. If I didn't have Enzo already right now, I I pick S ahead of him. So yeah, there you go. Um or or of course Anderson at Forest is great as well. It depends. It depends. If you want to save a lot of money and you feel like having that money in the bank is going to be useful for maybe a future move, then go Anderson. But if you're happy to spend the money, um yeah, it's minus like it. Uh Tatty made the official FPL 11 for this week. What the uh the official FPL scout man, can you add his Milasar? No, he's not a bench option. He's a transfer option. This is a bench list. People aren't If you're buying Sar, you're not benching him. Let's be Let's be 100% honest with ourselves. Bench Semen. Does Semeno need to go on this bench list? I think he maybe does. Um, is it controversial to say I prefer Thiago to Seno? Maybe it is, but it's the truth. The truth. Rob says, \"Have you seen me and the official FBL scout in the same room?\" I haven't, to be fair, Rob. I haven't. Yeah, you might be on to something there. Wouldn't uh take the risk and start keen over Richard's. Um, I'd be will I I think I'd be willing to take the I think I'd be willing to take the risk. Problem is Michelenko's back in the Everton team. So, is Branthroy going to play left back again or is he going to play as center back? And is Keen going to drop to the bench? I don't know, man. It's so difficult. Keen is just a nightmare player at the moment, unfortunately. Yeah. Jamie is captaining Ibrahim Sangare. Wish me luck. Uh, good luck Jamie. I actually picked up Sangar for my fantasy gaming hub team if anyone plays that. Um, picked him up today this morning. I have been training him. Uh, Wr says, \"Have no bench cover. Stack Gu worried about timber starting. Zero free transfers. Would you take a hit to have cover or leave it and pray? Depends how much money you have in your um in your bank. Um all of these players are going to have to go eventually anyway with the maybe exception of stack by gaming 31 because of the blank game week. So I would be willing to take a minus four, but only if I had money in the bank. Like what could you do? You could do Dutu Anderson. You could do Duta Hill. you could do. Um I I can't unless you got loads of money in the bank, I don't think there's anyone I'd be willing to sell Gu for. Um so Sto would probably be the player you'd go, but like you have a full 11. Is it worth a minus four? Would it be worth a hit? Would I take a hit? I don't think I would. I think if it was my FPL team, I don't think I'd take a hit. So I think on that basis I have to give the recommendation that unfortunately boring answer no hit. No no no transfer. No hit no transfer football hub is talking to me to start to Bravka and Sessi and Estv and bench Petravvic. Yeah I agree. I'd play to Bravo over Petravvic. Um and I play Sessi over Esteev. That makes sense. Stack is injured. He can't go on the bench list. Surely if you have Somerville, you 100% start him as well. Like why else would you have Somerville but to start him? Remember this is a bench list, not a transfer list. Virgil, Chia, Richard, Sness, Vandenberg. Which three to play? Uh, the benchist does answer that to be fair, but the answer is ciao sessi Virgil. Um, struggling to give advice on Hin Capier because I have no idea if he's going to start or not. Really struggling with that one there. So, sorry. Very, very difficult to give a judgment. I guess if you have him, you start him. But Vert's on the bench list. No, if you have verts, you start him. He's not really a benchable guy. Uh, Chaloba's not going on the bench list. You play Chaloba in every situation. Few people have asked about benching Chalaba now. Honestly, I cannot think of a reason to to bench uh Chaloba. I really can't. Like, he's he's like I mean, I'll put him on because people are asking the question, but I can't think of a world in which I would bench this week if I had him. Crazy stuff. He's a good pick this week. He really is. 16 minutes to deadline, by the way, guys. Um, so if you are making transfers, make sure you you are you're beginning to thinking about locking them in. Um, don't really want to leave them to the last 5 minutes just in case there's any website errors or anything like that. Obvious red says, \"Hi, Dan. Whom should I bring in? Timber for Collins or Enzo for Tavanir or just roll and risk pricing out?\" I mean, I wouldn't I don't honest I'm struggling with Enzo. I feel like if I didn't have Enzo in my team already, I don't think I'd buy him. Um, Timber in for Collins, I would do. though Tim Timber I would do in for Collins. So I like that one. Not the Enzo for Tavanir move. We'll we'll revisit that one next week. Maybe. Um Kagan says looking to next week. Any interest in buying Mane? Not really. No, not really my friend. Um I think I'm pro you're pro even in the double game week you're probably looking at a four-pointer from him. So, in that sense, I think we could probably do better. Um, we've got Zacharias here says, \"My defense says Gabriel Snessi, Virgil Chow. Who do I leave out?\" Probably Virgil. Probably Virgil. Ruben says, \"Wilson or Joel to start?\" Oh, if if you have Joel Petro, you absolutely start him ahead of Wilson. Absolutely start him. Yeah, that would be a a pretty easy one. your thoughts on triple captain Gabrielle? Uh, I'm I'm going to talk about it. I'm gonna talk about it. Yeah, you could tle Arsenal defense is crazy, by the way, Rob. Um, yeah, I'm going to talk about it properly tomorrow. Well, I'm going to do I think a short form video tomorrow and then in my team selection video, I'll talk a little further around um him, which might be Tuesday. No, Monday. Maybe Monday or Tuesday. Um, but yes, uh, if you follow me on Tik Tok or Instagram, then, uh, there will be a video about Gabrielle Triple Captain on there and what your other options are and kind of what the deal is with that one. Bson O'Reilly likely to start and do 90. I think he does start. I do think he does start. I don't know if he does 90, but I think he does 60. But is that that useful against Liverpool? Not sure. O'Reilly on the bench list. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean we could definitely put him on. You go low. Um as well arguably he go right at the bottom. Um is that harsh? Uh you're probably not looking to play I Riley this week, are you? Let's be real. Adlerfay, congratulations. You You've identified the only player that I would put lower than O'Reilly. Richards is already on the bench list. Um Patrick Cash on the bench list. H not really particularly high. Below Virgil, below Richards, probably below Collins, somewhere similar to a Stev maybe. Let's go here. I think I would argue we play Monard of N. It doesn't feel right. Um, yeah, let's go there. Have we done the Sen bit yet? Uh, no, we haven't. Nobody's asked. Nobody's asked for me to identify between Anderson and Anderson. So I've needed to I think people people are starting to understand the difference which is amazing and most people understood anyway. Uh Anderson for Collins. No, probably not. Foden. Do people still have Foden? Minions is the other player. uh mention there Zacharias I already answered answered your question my friend and I believe I said Virgil where's the toin cost gone I don't know it's been a while hasn't it nothing worth to coin costing right Martinez uh in goal maybe next to Pope we'll put him next to the Pope And who else? We said Munoz and we said Foden. I feel like you can put Munos reasonably high. If you have him, you probably got him here. I don't This is the last player on the bench list because the the text is just getting too small. No one's going to be able to read this. Um Odm was the other player. I said um I would be putting Fing pretty low. Uh I don't know. Like maybe is this harsh? Is that harsh? I don't know. It's just that risk of a onep pointer. It's just not worth it, is it? It's harsh, but it's causing too much pain. Is that is that Foden? Is V a play? Yeah, absolutely. Right. No more players on the bench there surely because this text is barely legible anymore. The over 60s in the chat are are struggling. Sorry to single you out, but I already know that you guys are struggling to read this and I can only apologize. Blame the people in the chat. Blame the people in the chat being too keen to get every differential player on the bench list. I can do no more. I can do no more. People talking about benching Harland is crazy. By the way, Roki, you forgot Palmer. If you own Palmer, 10.5 million, why are you thinking about benching him, man? Come on, be realistic. Ian with this with a member chat says, \"Hi, Dan. I'm late to the stream. Any update on Timber Watkins and Harland's fitness?\" Timber's apparently fine. Watkins is going to be in the squad. Harland, there's no fitness issues. There's no issues with Harland. People I think are reading into the comments about Harland too much. I don't think there's any news there. Few people are are saying they are struggling. Fraser had to move me to the big screen to read the text. This is why we we have to chill with the bench list a little bit. We have to chill with it a bit. I can only apologize. I rial from minus four. No, Leon, there were comments on Harland. I was just going on form. Oh, fair enough. Uh, yeah. No, there's no there's no injury issue. Why is Thiago so high? People are are changed their mind. on Thiago so much. He's a he's still a penalty taker. He's still a striker for a decent Brenford side. Like he's Thiago will will change the opinions on him very very quickly just like he did before. He will do it again. And all of the comments about why is Thiago high, why are you playing Thiago? I mean I don't even have Thiago, but I would play him if I had him probably. Um all those comments are gonna quickly dry up um in a few weeks time I think. Um you can zoom in on can you what on your phone when you on a YouTube video? I did not know that. [gasps] Oh my god. I didn't even realize. I just tried this. You can zoom in on a YouTube video. That's what I never knew that. I mean, it looks terrible, but I mean, it works. Wow. There we go. That's That is very much news to me. That is very much news to me. Uh right, we are getting towards uh towards deadline guys. Who's your differential of the week? Um differential of the week. What about uh what about Mad? MK makes the most sense, right? We know he's going to play. Dan is a YouTube veteran. He didn't know you can zoom. Well, I mean, in fairness, I don't really watch YouTube on my mobile phone, like ever. Certainly as a YouTube veteran, and I really am a YouTube veteran. I honestly I probably been making YouTube videos for as long as some people in this chat have been alive, which is crazy. Um, Rob says, \"Finally, I can just have Dan's face on my deadline stream.\" Is that what you want? Can't we just do this? If you want that, we can just do this. Not needed. Not needed. Uh, right. Do you feel Timber will start? I do. If I If I had to guess, I would say it's more likely that Timber starts and doesn't start, but I mean, I'm not 100% convinced. Why is DW uh H quite low? Who's DW? J Hall. Why is he quite low? um doesn't really get defensive contributions. Um doesn't get attacking returns that often. Everton not looking particularly strong in attack right now. Playing away from home, no penalties. I know a few reasons. Vat says Joel Pedro captain's thoughts. I mean he wouldn't he probably wouldn't make my top five, six, seven captains for this game week. So no, it's not something I would do. Um, I guess it's I guess some people like it, but I'm not one of those people. So, that's what my thoughts are as well Pedro. I think Wolves are particularly away from home is a harder game than it looks when judging on on the Premier League table. Um, I think there are better options and you got to think more about the not just about the fixture and the difficulty of the fixture but also like how is that game realistically going to play out? I don't know. Is your Pedro going to get much space? Zean says, \"Bro, please reply. I've asked 50 times Laqua Van Heeka or Bruno G. Which one to play? Ask 50 times. That's quite a lot of times. I'm so sorry I've not replied to you 50 times. Crazy. Roit says captaincy shout. I'd certainly put above uh Jedro. Yeah, Zean. I would play I would play maybe Laqua out of or would I? No, I I'd play Van Hecker. I'd play Van Heeka probably. I don't know. I don't know which one I'd play. Honestly, I don't know out of those players. It's You don't know if Bruno G is going to be available. Laqua possibly get Defcon, so that's nice. Van Hecka maybe won't as much, but I'm not expecting a clean sheet for Laqua. Uh I don't I honestly don't know. It's three-way coin toss. I'm struggling with that one. Um, I'm I'm really struggling with that. I don't know. Is there a threeway coin? If so, use that. I'm sorry for trolling you, but I wish I wish I had a clear answer on that. What does All right. If Instinct, what does Instinct say? If this is my team, Instinct, we've only got like two minutes till the deadline. Instinct says Laqua. Instinct says Laqua, but I have no idea if that's right. I might ask a robot. See what their projected points are. Okay, so uh if you give me one second. Um Oh, it reckons Van Heeka. All right, play Van Hecker. There you go. Right, we are super close to the deadline. Play van play van hecka is the answer. Um, we hopefully have all of the other bench related questions sorted on the bench list. If um you do want to just keep the bench list on screen for the last minute for whatever reason because you're still making changes, crazy. Um, then pause, take a screenshot, whatever. Um, but I should probably for the final minutes of the stream put my team on stream on screen because otherwise the show team gang are not going to be very happy with me. So this is what I am running with. I can see the show team gang in the chat already. We're almost to deadline. I've made my transfer. Saka Rice did that earlier in the stream. I've got Bruno captain, Gabrielle vice captain. We got Collins on the bench with Alder and Obi Drafco on the bench over Rya. We are ready to go. We are ready to go. The attack looks great in my team. In my opinion, my defense, Rya, Gabriel, Great Hill, Ciao. Who knows? Who knows what will happen, but I'll be here to find out. I'm excited. Uh, we have like got 40 seconds less than until deadline. We are really, really running out of time at this point. really running out of time. So, get those teams locked in. Get your team saved. Get your captain done. No more transfers now. The time has stopped. This time has ended. You run out of time. Run out of time. And you know what? Hang on. We'll we'll just get to the deadline and we'll go from there. We'll go from there. Zan is ready to go. Max is locked. Rob's asking about duck or chicken for tea. always chicken. Sambal's making Arsenal score predictions. Yo yabs is still asking Tarovski or Richardson. Who's Richardson? And the FPL deadline has passed. There we go. Gameweek 25. We are ready to go. Um, right. Is it worth sticking? [laughter] So, by the way, first of all, is everyone ready? Is everyone feeling confident? Are we happy with our captains? Let's check out the captain poll. Are we happy? Are we ready? Are we raring to go? That's what I want to know. Um, the captain poll final answers with Bruno Fernandez 74%, Joel Pedro 11%, Gabrielle 9%, and Harland just six%. Crazy. Crazy. Um, we got a random deadline question from Ian. That's a post deadline question that says, \"Do people still have house phones? Do those even exist anymore?\" I can tell you, Ian, I moved out from my like mom's house 10 years ago, maybe, maybe 10 years ago, maybe nine, and I have not once owned a house phone during that time. So, there are people who own a house phone. I don't know if they use them very often. I think my my nan still calls people on the house phone. And that's about it. Nans and people trying to sell you stuff are the two categories of people use house phones. So there we go. That those are the people. What phone does Pep call you on? My mobile phone, of course. What do you mean? Pep Guardiola calls me when he calls me. He calls me on my my my modded Have you seen these these modern mobile phones? What? They're crazy good because they're they're literally portable. You don't have to they don't attach to a wire to your wall or anything. They're new. They're new in um if it's the 1980s at least. They're new in and uh works the same as a as a as a telephone, but it's mobile. You plug it into your car or something. Um, is it electrical supply? Wasn't I wasn't around in the 80s. Scammers also use them. There you go. Another another category of people who use uh landline phones. That phone was in Wall Street. No, it wasn't. It was in my bedroom the whole time. Bedroom. Is this Is this my bedroom? This isn't my bedroom. I don't sleep in here. [laughter] I probably could sleep in here, but I don't. There's not even a bed in here. Why don't I call it my bed? My uh my bedroom. Guess it is technically a bedroom. It's the spare bedroom. Max says, \"I remember learning from last season. You wanted to be a bit more risk averse. Feel you've implemented your lessons from last season.\" I think I like taking risks a lot in FPL and I do like it and um I think what I've learned is to try and be a little smarter in the way I'm taking risks. So for example, if you look at my team, what are the risks that I'm taking? Okay, I'm picking databacked players maybe a little bit earlier, maybe one or two weeks earlier than other people. So I bought maybe in Burmo in a little early. I bought Enzo in maybe a little early. I've kept Anderson in the whole time. These are Anderson is a risky, you know, differential whatever player, but he's kind of boring and not really risky. So I think I don't think it's risky that I want to play. It's differential. I like to play a differential game. So I often buy players who are lowowned or particularly at the time they're lowowned and then you know people often get on in on them. I bought Chiao really early. I think he was under 1% when I first got him in. Hill was under 1% when I got him in last week. So, I'm trying to make take differential players who aren't necessarily risky players if that makes sense. So, I can still play differential. Collins as well um has been was like 2% owned 1.5% owned when um I bought him in something like that. So, I'm buying players who I I see something in that aren't necessarily risky but are differential. So, I'm able to play a differential game without necessarily taking a huge amount of risks. I don't know. So, yeah, I I feel like certainly this season is going better for me than the last couple of seasons. I've had two terrible seasons in a row. Um, yeah, Rob Taty would be an example of a a risky differential. Not a not a sensible differential, a risky differential. So, I don't know. I don't know. Also, captains, whenever there's an opportunity to go for a differential captain, I'll usually take it. Do you not think ownership goes up after people watch your videos? Not really. Not really. I'm not going to be uh overrating my influence here or anything like that. Um, yeah, probably not. Maybe a tiny, you know, we're talking about a few thousand people, which maybe we'll take some transfer advice. And you know, often when I buy differentials, people don't go for them. People don't want to follow me down those paths because they kind of would prefer to go for the slightly more popular options, which is fine, too. Um, and I don't think I'm I'm convincing enough. If I was coming off the back of my 243rd finish, then I think people would maybe be more convinced if when I suggest a differential. Now, they're probably like, \"Oh, here we go again.\" So I don't think I can convince people on differentials maybe as easily as I would have been able to previously. Um but yeah going for sensible high floor high ceiling differential players. Well high floor differential players. Some have high ceilings as well but most of them have high floors which is which is something I like. And just playing a long game. Think you're underestimating the lazy viewers that will just copy. Yeah. And there will be there will be, you know, a couple hundred people who will copy my team verbatim every week or at least as much as they can because they'll often be like last minute deadline changes or you know I make a move earlier in the week to for the purpose of price changes and it prices other people out. So it's actually surprisingly difficult. But Josh says, \"Yo, I wondering where you get your football shirts from.\" Everywhere, man. Everywhere. Like there's no uh lots from classic football shirts. They're not they're not particularly good value for money. Um gifts like birthdays, Christmases, family member goes on holiday, they'll often buy me a football shirt um because they know I collect them. Um yeah, or like directly from like Nike or Adidas or Sports Direct. Anywhere, man. Anywhere I can find them for a good price. anywhere I can find them. Um, is it worth waiting for the team news for Le versus Nottingham Forest? Does anyone care? Need a Benfica shirt. You know what? Maybe I do need a Benfica shirt. I need to get some Portuguese shirts. I haven't even got a Portugal Portugal national team shirt. I need to get that for the World Cup this year. Yeah, I wouldn't mind getting a a Portuguese club shirt as well. Should it be Benfica? Not Porto. Not Sporting. I don't think I go Sporting. I think my favorite Portuguese team is probably Porto though, not Benfica. I'm totally honest. Yeah. Anyway, um yeah, let's uh you can send me one. Nez, what size? What size? I really do need to open up a PO box. People often offer to send me football shirts like through YouTube and stuff, and I would love to see what you guys send me, but I just I just my issue is I don't know how comfortable I feel accepting gifts from people. Does that make sense? I would love to um I'd love to receive more football shirts. Of course I would, but it doesn't feel right to take. You should do a stream. I mean, yeah, if I was to do a uh I thought about doing some some second channel football shirt content of some variety because I do have some interesting football shirts. But um yeah, maybe another time. Um, but yeah, I think I'm I think we're gonna end the stream now because even though we could wait for Le versus Nottingham Forest team news is Isn't accepting a gift any different to Super Chat? Yeah, but I can't I can give something back with a super chat. I can like reply. I can talk. I can feel like I can have an instant impact back. I feel like I'm at least maybe somewhat earning it. Even that's debatable. But receiving a full-on gift is just like I don't know. It would mean people could see the top they bought in the pod. That's true. And maybe people would get a kick out that. But I mean that I don't know. I don't know. Feels arrogant. I don't know. Um I'll think about it. Maybe if like I'll do it like for one month only. I'll open up a a PO box and if people want to send stuff um then we can. And I'll encourage people to write messages and stuff that I can read out or whatever. up. Um, yes. Um, we're going to leave the uh double chest with Dan a akin to fun with flags. It could be. It could be. What would it be? Uh, joy with jerseys. Shirts and giggles. What? Shirts and giggles. Anyway, right. I'm trying to go. Um, yeah, I'm meeting her friends tonight. So, um, yeah, it'll be, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna go. I need to have a shower because I've been cooking in a football shirt for over an hour in the stream and how well, sorry, over two hours. Uh, two and a half hours pretty much. But, uh, yeah, guys, appreciate you guys today. Thank you for the super chats, the chats, the conversation, the the FBL stuff. Good luck this game week. Good luck. Um, enjoy it and and and prepare for more FB content and for more FO decision- making because the next deadline is on Tuesday. So, um, we got to be ready for it. Cheers, guys. Thank you so much for watching. Good luck this game week, and I will see you later, mates. Bye-bye. Oh, hey. Oh. Heat. Heat. Oh, oh, oh.",
