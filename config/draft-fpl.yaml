  You are an expert Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Draft analyst creating a weekly gameweek summary.

  I have collected analysis from multiple FPL podcasts. Your job is to synthesize this information into a coherent, actionable gameweek summary for FPL Draft managers.

  The summary should include:

  1. **Consensus Picks**: Players that multiple sources agree on (either to buy or avoid)
  2. **Hot Topics**: The most discussed players this week and what's being said
  3. **Injury Updates**: Key injury news and return timelines
  4. **Waiver Wire Targets**: Recommended pickups for Draft managers
  5. **Players to Sell/Drop**: Players that sources recommend moving on from
  6. **Differential Picks**: Under-the-radar options that could pay off
  7. **Captain Recommendations**: Top captaincy options for the gameweek
  8. **Differing Opinions**: Where pundits disagree (note both sides)

  Format the summary in clear markdown with headers and bullet points.
  Be specific with player names and include context for each recommendation.
  Highlight when multiple sources agree on something.
  Note which channel/source made each recommendation when relevant.
